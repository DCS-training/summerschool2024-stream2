at the eminent risk of their being again soon swallowed up.  At the
north-west boundary, there is an immense ridge of sand which is
still encroaching on the land, but so slowly, that, if a judgment may
be formed from its progress for the last twelve years, ages must
have elapsed ere such a large district of country could have been
overwhelmed.

   February 1840.

                           PARISH OF FORGUE.

                 PRESBYTERY OF TURRIFF, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

                     THE REV. JAMES CORDINER, MINISTER.

                     I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE ancient name of the parish seems to have been
Forrig, as appears from an inscription on two old communion cups
the mouths of which are of beaten silver, and the pillars of which
are tastefully ornamented with the leaves and tendrils of the vine. *
The name of the parish is believed to be Gaelic.
   Boundaries, &c.-Forgue is bounded on the south by Insch and
Culsalmond; on the east, by Inverkeithnie and Auchterless; on
the north, by Rothiemay; and on the west, by Drumblade and
Huntly.  The boundaries are irregular.  The greatest length
from north to south,-that is, from the Ury to the Deveron,-is
about nine miles and a-half or ten miles, and the greatest breadth
from east to west may be about six and a half miles.
   Topographical Appearances.-The surface of the parish is un-

<FOOTNOTE>These cups were presented by the head of the Crichton fami y of Frendraught,
to the church of Forgue in 1633, and bear the following inscription: "GIFTIT. To.
GOD. AND HIS. CHURCH. DE. JAMES. CREIGHTOUN. OF. FRENDRAUEGHT., TO. THE.
KIRK. oF. FORRIG., 1633."
   A baptismal basin, likewise, seems to have been presented by the head of the
name family, but at a later, period, as is plain from the different orthography of the
inscription.  The basin is of beaten silver of large dimensions, but has no date.  On
the bottom, the Crichton arms and motto appear, and round the edge is the follow,
ing inscription: "GIFTIT. TO. GOD. AND. HJB. CHURCH. OF FORGUE., BY JAMES.
VISCOUNT. OF. FRENDRAUGHT., LORD. CRCHTONE.
   From the difference of the spelling, the fair inference is, that the cups were pre-
mented at an earlier period, and the basin at a later; and from the addition of the
title to the inscription on the basin, and the omission of it altogether on the cups
the Crichton family must have been ennobled between these periods.
