                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
        THIS parish had, till lately, the district of Muckairn united to
     it; and the minister serving the cure preached on alternate Sab-
     baths in the church built for each district. After the legislative
     enactment for endowing additional places of worship in the High-
     lands, (4th and 5th Geo. IV. c. 79 and 90), Muckairn obtained
     the benefit of a minister for itself, having, in 1829, been erected
     into a parish quoad sacra.  But the church of Muckairn is at pre-
     sent vacant; and, besides this, the two districts are separated by an
     arm of the sea : it appears more natural, therefore, to describe them
     separately.
