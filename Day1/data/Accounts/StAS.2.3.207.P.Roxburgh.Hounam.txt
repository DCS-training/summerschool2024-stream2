by the superior cleanness and condition of the land on most of the
farms.  Much of the surface water has been removed by draining, and
the soil is in consequence improved.  In the cultivation of the arable
soils, the greatest improvement which has taken place is the intro-
duction of the culture of turnips, a crop to which the soil is emi-
nently adapted.   The mode of husbandry having been altered and
improved, prices of labour and raw produce of every description
have undergone a proportional alteration.  The breed of cows and
cattle and other stock has been very much improved, and the sheep
stock even more so.  The writer is doubtful whether much im-
provement can now be made on the general system of our husban-
dry,--except only in subjecting the land to a less severe crop-
ping, and in creating additional shelter by more extended planta-
tion.  Were the same taste and spirit displayed in this respect by the
other landholders as by the Duke of Roxburghe and Mr Dickson
of Chatto, Hounam, from the nature of its surface and localities,
the salubrity of the atmosphere, and beauty and variety of the scen-
ery, might be one of the most attractive of our border parishes.
A ver superior coal, and not inferior in quality to any in Scot-
land, might be had at a very moderate price from Reed water in
the neighbourhood of Birdhopecrag; but it is much to be regret-
ted that the road leading from Pennymuir to the lime and coal-
works there, so far as it extends through Oxnam parish, is but
partially made.  If this line of road were to be completed, and
supported out of the general funds of the district to which it be-
longs, which, in all probability it will be the case ere long, it would
be of incalculable benefit not only to this parish, but to the dis-
trict generally, as it would open an easy intercourse to the west-
ward in Scotland, as well ar into England.
