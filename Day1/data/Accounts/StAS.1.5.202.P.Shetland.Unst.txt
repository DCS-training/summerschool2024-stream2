     Statistical Account

ded to Scotland by the Danes, the scatt was fixed as the
only land-tax that should ever be levied upon these islands.
Since a new land-tax has, however, been imposed, it
seems reasonable, that government should abolish the pay-
ment of the scatt, by a compromise with the present pro-
prietor, and a compensation made to him for the loss which
he would thus sustain.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-No roads have yet been
made through this island, either by statute labour or other-
wife.  Only a very few carts are used in it, and no
carriages for pleasure.  Enclosures have been tried by two
gentlemen, and have been found of the utmost utility.
There is no post-office in this island.  The only post-house,
indeed, in Shetland, is at Lerwick, which is 40 miles di-
stant from this.
   Perhaps the most extraordinary circumstance respecting
this and the rest of the Shetland islands, is this, that
the landholders have hitherto supinely waved their in-
herent right of representation in Parliament, lately
confirmed by a solemn judgment of the House of Peers,
and have tamely suffered the freeholders of Orkney alone, to
chuse the representative for both countries; thereby de-
priving themselves of all that Parliamentary influence
which their neighbours hold in such high estimation.-Yet
being thus exempted from the evils of political dissention,
it is questionable, whether their situation is not, on the
whole, the better of the two, being more favourable to
peace, to union, and to virtue, if is is less calculated for
promotion and preserment.
