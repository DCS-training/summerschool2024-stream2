     NUMBER XL.

     PARISH OF ALLOA.

     (County of Clackmannan-Presbytery of Stirling-Synod of
     Perth and Stirling.

     Drawn up from the Communicating of the Rev. Mr. JANES
     FRAME, and of JOHN FRANCIS ERSKINE, Esq. of ALLOA,
     Representative of the MARR Family.

between the ford of Frosk and Manor.  It had on its point a piece of a human
scull.  It appeared to be of Roman workmanship; and seems to confirm the
opinion, that this part of the river had been frequented by the Romans, as a
passage from the south to the north.  This dagger was presented by Mr.
ALEXANDER COLSTREAM, schoolmaster at Crieff, (into whole hands it fell,
when schoolmaster at alloa), to the Society of Antiquarians in Perth,
