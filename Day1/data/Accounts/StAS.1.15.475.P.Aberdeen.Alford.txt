Aberdeen.  We have likewise a few muir-fowl, and plenty
of hares, patridges, snipes, plovers, and wild ducks; and,
at particular seasons, curlews, woodcocks, dottrels, and scail
drakes.  Of other birds, the country is infested with hawks
of almost all sorts; the falcon, sparrow-hawk, martins, and a
rare species, commonly called blue sleeves, and with kites of
different sizes and descriptions.  The hooded crows are not
so numerous, but rooks and daws are in prodigious numbers.
Sometimes the great woodpecker has been found in our
woods, and the king's fisher on the river, though they are
exceeding rare.  In general, our woods have increased the
number of the birds and beasts of prey, and consequently di-
minished the quantity of game in the country.

exceed 3 L.  The whole amount is too slender an allowance

duties which this class of men owe to the public.
   The funds for the maintenance of the poor, are the inte-
