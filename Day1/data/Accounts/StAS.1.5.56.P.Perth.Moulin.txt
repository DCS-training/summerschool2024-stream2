Moulin, three quarters of a mile from Pitlochry, containing
37 families.

   Natural Productions.-There are some considerable oak
and birch woods on the lower grounds, along the sides of
the rivers.  Some oak bark, for tanning leather, is yearly
sold, and, next to linen yarn, is the principal commodity
which the parish exports.  The soil is, in general, favour-
able to the growth of forest and fruit trees.  Some planta-
tions of larch and Scotch firs have been made, on the hills
and moorish grounds, and are still going on, particularly
on one estate, where there are 400 acres planted.  The other
plantations, may be about 300 acres.  Oak woods, within
the parish, are worth, at a cutting, L. 4500.  Birch, a-
bout L. 500.

   The ordinary crops raised by the farmers are, oats, bear,
flax, and potatoes.  Turnips, and clover, with rye-grass, are
cultivated by a few gentlemen.  Small quantities of rye and
pease are also raised; but no wheat nor beans.  Esculent plants
of all kinds are cultivated with success.  Along the banks of
the Tummel, where there is good shelter from the north,
the climate is favourable, and vegetation usually very for-
ward.  In the Strathardle division, where there is less shel-
ter, the season is more backward.  Inclosures are few, but
they are multiplying yearly.

   Crops.-The number of plough-gangs, in the hands of te-
nants, is about 141 1/2, and in those of gentlemen, 8 1/2; reck-
oning 13 acres of arable land to each plough-gang, the
whole number of acres in cultivation, will be about 1950.
Oats are sown in April; then lintseed and potatoes; bear is
sown between the middle, and the end of May.  The time of
