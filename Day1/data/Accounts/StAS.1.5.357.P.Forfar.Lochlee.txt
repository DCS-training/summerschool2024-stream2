     NUMBER XXIII.

     PARISH OF LOCHLEE,

     (COUNTY OF ANGUS.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN PIRIE.

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   LOCHLEE is evidently derived from a loch si-
tuated in a deep bottom, almost surrounded with
steep and high hills; at the east end of which, the parish
church stands.-The parish is situated in the north corner
of Forfashire, in the presbytery of Brechin, and Synod of
Angus and Mearns.  It is surrounded with high hills, part
of the Grampians, a narrow opening at the east end ex-
cepted, through which the river North Esk passes to the
low country; and it is nearly intersected in two or three
places by hills.  It is about 12 miles long from E. to W.
and 6 miles broad from N. to S. if regard is had to its pa-
sture grounds; and there are about 8 miles betwixt the
most distant dwelling houses from E. to W. and 4 from
N. to S.; it is nearly of the same breadth from end to
end.
