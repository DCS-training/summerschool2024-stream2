     of St. Fergus.

   Antiquities-As this parish has, for upwards of 500 years,
been only a part of a larger estate, and never divided into
small properties, we cannot expect to find stately mansions
here.  Some pieces of stone and lime are to be met with,
hard by the mouth of the Ugie, where it falls into the sea,
and here, it is said, was the ancient residence of the family
of Cheyne.  They afterwards built another castle, to which
they also gave the name of INVERUGIE,* at the distance of
more than a mile westward, on the same side of the river.
The site of this castle does honour to the judgement and
good taste of its founder.  Here the Ugie forms a semi-
circle before the castle, and the area of this semicircle is ter-
minated, by Mount-Pleasant, a steep rising ground on the op-
posite side of the river.  The castle is now in ruins, but the
two courts are almost entire; part of them serves as a gra-
nery, and part is used as a brewery for porter and beer.
Within a few paces of the wall of the North court, are the
remains of an ice-house, which perhaps was the first of the
kind in this country.-On an eminence N. W. from the
castle, there is an artificial moat, where, it is probable, the
ancient proprietors held their courts for the distribution of
justice.

   Character and Manner of Living.-The people in general
are very hospitable, kind to strangers, intelligent and conten-
ted.  They have such an attachment to their native soil, that
few of them chose to leave it.  From Buchan there never
were any emigrations, and indeed there can be no reason for
     VOD. XV. U

<FOOTNOTE>

*This continued to be the residence of the succeeding proprietors, until
the attainder of Lord Marischal, who unfortunately engaged in the rebel-
lion 1715.  The precise time when this castle was built is not known; but as
one part of it, now in ruins, was called the Clone's-Tower, it is probable that
it was built by that family.
