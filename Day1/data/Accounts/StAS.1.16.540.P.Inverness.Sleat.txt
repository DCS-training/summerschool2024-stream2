     Statistical Account

general character of the genius or temper of the inhabitants;
it is probable that some of my neighbouring brethren may
have favoured the public with such disquisitions, of course
their information may satisfy the reader as to the manners
and customs of the parishioners of Sleat, there being natu-
rally much similarity, by reason of the contiguity of the
parishes.  I deem it likewise superfluous, if not imperti-
nent, to give any opinion as to the manner in which this
part of the country is treated by the Legislature, or more
properly speaking, by those in power, as it is to be suppo-
sed, that in a proportionate degree the same attention is
paid to it, as to the rest of the empire.
