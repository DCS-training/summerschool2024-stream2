trade immediately ministred.  But the abolition of that trade
has had a happy effect upon the improvement of the country,
and the manners of the people in this corner; and the traces
of these more licentious times, which were a proverbial re-
proach to this parish, are now almost wholly obliterated.
The present generation are trained up in habits of sobriety
and industry, for which, and for their attention to their
farms and respective occupations, they are perhaps now no
less remarkable, than they were in those more dissolute times,
for their dissipation.

   Disadvantages.-The most striking which occur apply to
the whole county of Galloway, as well as to this parish,
namely, the disadvantages under which the farmers and
breeders of black cattle, the great staple of this part of the
country, labour in marketing them.-A number of young
fellows, of the very lowest class who dislike, or affect to be
above labour, turn what are called jobbers, scour the country,
and infest the cattle markets, and, by picking up the younger
cattle, intercept a profit between the breeder and grazier, to
the prejudice of one, or perhaps both of them.  This is an
evil which it is impracticable to restrain, unless by something
like the following method: That the farmers in general, for
their mutual advantage, should enter into a concert, where-
by it shall be understood, to be laid down as a rule, that
those who rear the cattle shall-fell them only to those, who,
they know, can graze them upon their own farms or posses-
sions; and that those again shall buy only from those, whom
they know to have reared them, or who have kept them at
least for months.-Another evil, of which the consequences
have been, and presently are, severely felt by many, is the
frequent and weighty failures of the greater drovers, that is,
those who yearly buy the aged cattle through the country,
