are upwards of 20 heritors, besides a number of small feuers.
The only principal heritors at present residing are Mr Er-
skine of Cardross, the patron of the parish, and Mr Graham
of Gartmore.
   The valued rent of the whole is 5471 L. Scots.  The real
rent it would be difficult, with any degree of accuracy, to
investigate.

   Poor.-The number of poor on the session lists is com-
monly from 33 to 40.  They are supported partly by the
weekly collections at church; by the dues paid on the pro-
clamation of banns, and for the use of the mort-cloth; by
the annual produce of some money laid out at interest; and
partly by the private charities of their neighbours of different
ranks, who are in general well inclined, according to their
ability, to assist and relieve the indigent and distressed.

   Productions.-It is undoubted, that this parish raises more
grain than is consumed by the inhabitants, a great many bolls
of oat-meal being yearly exported to Glasgow, Dumbarton,
and to the Highlands.  The greater part of the barley is
converted into whisky by the licensed distillers.  Consider-
able quantities also of butter and cheese are sent to market in
the great towns.
