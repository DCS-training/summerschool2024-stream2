some years ago to the original building, there is a very numerous
and valuable collection of paintings, which are much admired and
have a very imposing effect.  The Tweed flows close past the
house on the southeast. Broad meadows House is a more modern
building, in the Grecian style of architecture.  The stone employ-
ed in its construction is a very fine white freestone. The apart-
ments are elegant, and the accommodation extensive. Spittal
House and Tweed-hill are neat country residences. The latter is
situated on the Tweed, at a short distance from the Union Chain
Bridge, and the whole scenery connected with this villa, as well as
with Paxton, which is immediately contiguous, presents features of
considerable beauty. The trees at both these places seem to               .
thrive admirably.

<TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>
   There are no records by which we can trace the ancient state of
the population. That it was numerically less than at present is
certain. It appears to have been gradually rising, until within the
last ten or twelve years, when a slight decrease took place.

   Language, Habits, &c. the People.-The language generally
spoken is the Berwickshire dialect of the Scots, intermixed occa-
sionally with the Northumbrian burr. The most remarkable pe-
culiarities which distinguish this dialect are observable in the fol-
lowing words: fire, pronounced feyre; water, wayter; chair, shire;
two, twae; church, surch; cheese, sheese, &c. There is no rea-
son to suppose that any very material alteration in this respect has
occurred within the last forty years.
