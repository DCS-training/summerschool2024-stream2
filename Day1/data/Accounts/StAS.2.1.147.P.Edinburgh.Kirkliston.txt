The acting parochial teacher is assistant and successor to the
schoolmaster, to whom the whole legal salary pertaining to the
office, which amounts to L.34,4s.4 1/2d. per annum, continues to
be paid. By the liberality of the heritors, the officiating teacher
possesses the dwelling-house and garden, and receives a salary Of
L.10 per annum, during the life, of the retired schoolmaster.
The fees are paid quarterly, in advance, and may amount to L. 50
a year. The teacher has also about L. 20 a year as session-clerk,
and clerk to the heritors and Statute Labour Commissioners
There are not many persons, between the years of six and fifteen,
who cannot read; a large proportion of the young- between these
years can write; and there are very few of those above fifteen
years, who are unable to read, and, in a certain degree, also to
write. The people seem to be generally alive to the benefits of
education. No parts of the parish are so remote from all the
schools as to prevent the children from attending one or other of
them. The number of schools is sufficient for the parish.

wives and widows, in name of funeral allowance; 3d, to afford
payment of an annuity to the widows of members during their
widowhood. This institution has maintained great prosperity,
and has been productive of the happiest effects, both in promoting
industry, and in ministering to the comfort of the sick and destitute,
