     Means of Communication.-The nearest post-office is Cupar.
The turnpike road leading from Cupar to Newburgh, and extend-
ing to one mile and 1400 yards, lies along the south boundary of
the parish. A statute labour road of one mile and 500 yards
connects the Newburgh road on the south with the great Dun-
dee road on the north. There is, beside, a private farm road which
goes tbrough the middle of the parish.
     Ecclesiastical State.-The church of Moonzie is situated on a
rising ground in the south-west part of the parish, and is easily
accessible to all the population. It is a small plain building, with-
out spire or other ornament. From its elevated position, it forms
a conspicuous object from the Newburgh road, and enjoys the
name of the Visible Kirk, from being a landmark to mariners en-
tering the Tay. It has all the marks of an old building, but the
time of its erection is unknown. It was lately repaired and new
seated; and though Dot possessed of any external beauty, is now
a comfortable place of worship. It has accommodation for 171
sitters. All the sittings are free.
     The church and teinds of the parish of Moonzie belonged at
one time to a religious fraternity at Scotland Well, in Kinross-
shire, called the Ministers of the Fratres Sanctae Trinitatis de
Redemptione Captivorum. William Malvoisin, Bishop of St An-
drews, who died in 1238, was the founder of this institution, and
set apart the teinds of the parish of Moonzie for its support. Its
design was to show hospitality to religious pilgrims, and collect
money for the redemption of Christians who had been taken cap-
tives by the Turks. The brethren of the ministry performed the
spiritual duties of the parish, and continued to act in that capacity
till the Reformation. In 1564, the parish of Moonzie was united
to that of Cupar; but, in 1625, it was disjoined and again made
a separate parish, and Mr James Wedderburn admitted minister.
