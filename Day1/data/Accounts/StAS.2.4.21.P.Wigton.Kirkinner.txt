vided for as follows: Average annual collections at church doors;
L.25; voluntary contribution by the heritors, L.50; interest of L.30,
L.1, 10s.; proclamations, morcloth, donations, &c, L, 4, 10s.
	I fear the disposition among the poor to refrain from seeking pa-
rochial aid is daily becoming less, and I consider the voluntarry con-
tribution made by the heritors as ` very great evil in that respect.
Many, I am persuaded, now apply for relief, believing that, what-
ever they get, comes from the heritors, and not from the poor's box;
but it is much easier to prevent an evil than to remedy it.
	Alehouses.--There are 4 alehouses in the parish, and I have
no doubt that, in some instances, they are very prejudicial to the
morals of the people.
	Fuel.--The common fuel used in the parish is peat at 2s, 6d.
per cart load. Coals are imported from the English coast, and
sold at 16s. per ton.

     MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	Since the former Statistical Account was published, a great
change has taken place in the parish. Wages and rent are
doubled,--the lands are in the highest state of improvement, where
they were formerly covered with whins,--and 10,000 bushels of
fine wheat are now annually produced, where it was formerly thought
there was something either in the soil or in the climate unfriend-
ly to that grain. The blessings of education are now more gene-
rally diffused amongst the people; and I would fondly hope that
their character, intellectual, moral, and religious, is greatly im-
proved.
