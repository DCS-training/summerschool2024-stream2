5 heritors, 4 of whom reside.  The valued rent of the
parish is 2312 L. 13 s. 4 d. Scoth money.  The stipend is
about 90 L. a year, including communion elements.  The
church and manse are both old buildings.  The school
and school-house is a new building.  The glebe consists
of about 5 acres of good dry flat land, upon a sandy bot-
tom, and is enclosed.  The principal and professors of
the united college of St. Andrew's are patrons of the pa-
rish, and titulars of the teinds.  The fund for the main-
tenance of the poor arises from the interest of 220 L.
Sterling, at 5 per cent.; the rent of 13/4th acres of land,
and of several seats in the church, mortcloth-money,
fees of proclamation, and collections at the church door
on Sunday, and may amount to about 20 L. or 25 L. a
year.  The money at interest, and that with which the
13/1th acres of land was purchased, seems to have arisen
from the gradual accumulation of a long course of care-
ful management.  The only donation that appears to
have been made to the session, is a legacy left about a
years ago by Mrs. Margaret Bethune of Blebo, a lady
whose beneficence to the poor during her lifetime, was
most extensive and exemplary,and who, at her death,
bequeathed to them the sum of 50 L. Sterling.  Of this
legacy, however, only 30 L. were added to the session
funds; the other 20 L. were immediately distributed a-
mong the poor, to alleviate in some measure, their grief
for the loss of one of their greatest benefactors.  With
this small fund, the session is enabled to relieve the pres-
sing necessities of several families of well disposed Chris-
tians, whom it hath pleased Providence to reduce to cir-
cumtances of distress, to soothe, in a small degree, the
affliction of the widow and the fatherless, and to afford
some little consolation to the infirmities and distresses
