			PARISH OF LUNDIE AND FOWLIS.

	     PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

	       	    THE REV. THOMAS IRVINE, MINISTER.

	LUNDIE and Fowlis have long been united into one parish. In
the former Statistical report the union is said to have been effect-

ed by decree of the High Commission in 1618. But as they are
situated in different counties, as each maintains its church, its
own school, aid its own poor, and as they are in the hands of dif-
ferent proprietors, and differ much in their situation and aspect,
it may be advisable, to a certain extent, to describe them sepa-
rately.
