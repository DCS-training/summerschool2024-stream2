took places-which was not looked upon aar proper stealing.  Many
persons thought themselves at liberty to appropriate goods of that
description, who were never known to steal an article from their
neighbours.  A good deal had been done to check the evil by the.
vigorous measures of Mr Scarth; but the discipline of the church
was required to put an effectual stop to it.  A very different feel-
ing now prevails upon the subject, Shipwrecked property bas
come to be regarded as personal property; and people who were
once in the habit of taking it without shame or remorse, express
openly the change that has taken place in their'views.  At the
last two or three wrecks, scarcely any thing was stolen.
   During the winter season, it was customary to carry on a perpe-
tual succession of merry-makings, called balls.  Every marriage,
was the occasion of two-tbe bride's friends being at the expense
of the wedding-feast, and the best-man feeling himself called upon
to give the back-feast, which occurred a month or two after the-
weddina, and in which be was assisted by contributions from some
of the other young men in the immediate neighbourbood.  Be-
sides these regular meetings, a great manv more were added to fill
up the void.  Their moral effect was decidedly pernicious in va-
rious ways; but the kirk-session having interfered, little or no ex-
cess of this kind takes place.
   By the same interference smuggling may now be said to be al-
most, if not completely abolished.
   In general habits, the people are, now at least, remarkably de-
cent and sober.
   Education.-There is a school in the island supported by the
   Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge.
