     Statistical Account

colliers of this parish are tolerably regular and industri-
ous.

   Fish.-Cod, skate, ling, turbot, and shell-fish of various
kinds are in great plenty on the coast in all the seasons.  Be-
sides the great quantities sold here, many are sent to the
Edinburgh market; haddocks, for which our coast is fa-

grampuses are sometimes seen here.  The length of coast
washed by the sea, belonging to this parish, is about 2 miles,
all rock and sand.  The farmers next the coast have access
to sea-ware, which is excellent manure for raising barley,
and to some kelp.  The scarcity of growing timber for
farming utensils, is a disadvantage to the farmers.

   Manners.-The gentlemen who reside on their estates,
contribute not a little to the good order and happiness of
their tenants, and the other inhabitants of the parish; being
assable, humane, and hospitable to all around them, they se-
cure the affection, esteem, and attachment of their depen-
dents, and by employing a variety of tradesmen and labour-
ers in the field, they are benefactors to many.  They are
abundantly active, and public spirited likewise with respect
to the improvement of roads.  The farmers are intelligent
sensible men in general, who, by means of their knowledge
and industry, live comfortably, and several of them genteelly,
notwithstanding the high rents.  The manufacturers and
tradesmen are generally industrious and regular.  The peo-
ple of this parish are much improved in point of sobriety;
they are seldom seen in clubs in public houses, and instances
of drunkenness are very rare; 30 or 40 years ago, public
houses were much frequented here by people of all ranks;
in these days they drank much brandy, and other spiritous
