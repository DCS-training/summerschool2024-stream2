        I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.--CHALMERS supposes that the name of this parish is a
corruption of the Gaelic word Bogh n' uill, signifying foot of the
rivulet. The oldest spelling is Buchnull, which occurs in the
fourteenth century.  Afterwards, it was long spelled Bulhill, and
subsequently Bunnull.
   This parish was enlarged in 1650, by the annexation of Tulli-
chewen, Stockragent, Cameron, and Auchendennan, from the
parish of Luss; and of Balloch, Milton, Blairquhois (now Wes-
terton), Ballagan, and Ledrestbeg, from the parish of Kilmaro-
nock.  The annexation was effected by the Commissioners for the
Plantation of Kirks, at the desire of the heritors and the presbytery.
Before this event, there had been only 120 communicants in the
parish.
   Boundaries, Extent, &c.--Bonbill is bounded on the north and
north-east by the parish of Kilmaronock and Loch Lomond; on
the east, by the parish of Dumbarton ; on the south and south-
west, by the parish of Cardross; and on the weft by Luss. It
is 4 1/2 miles in length, and 4 in breadth, forming nearly a square.
   Hydrography.--The river Leven issues from Loch Lomond at
Balloch, and falls into the Frith of Clyde at Dumbarton Castle,
after a course of about nine miles in length. The tide comes up
the river more than a third part of its length, and the stream is
navigable in its whole extent. It produces excellent salmon, and
a variety of other fish.
   Remarkable Ash Tree.--This large tree stands in the church-
yard, and has been long regarded as one of the most remarkable
of the species in this country. In the year, 1768 it wa's measured
by Mr Beevor, who found it to be 16 feet 9 inches in circumfe-
