     Of the Fair Isle.

of nature.  The soil on its surface, which consists of about
12 acres, produces a kind of grafs that maintains annually
24 sheep, which are as remarkable for the excellence of
their wool, as for the value of their carcasses.  In several
parts of his solitary isle, where the rock has been soft, or
a stratum of clay has presented its surface, the sea has
dug many deep gulfs or gullies to a considerable dis-
tance.  Of this kind is the one on the S. E. side of the
island, called Stromceiler; in which, tradition asserts, one
of the ships of the Spanish Armanda, in the year 1588,
suffered shipwreck.  The inhabitants believe she is now
converted into a rock, and covered with sea weed. Cap-
tain Roe, from England, in 1740, when fishing the
wreck, was fortunate enough to raise two brass guns, of a
large size, and some other articles of less value; but hav-
ing lost a man in the attempt, he desisted.  About the
year 1770, a ship bolt, long and thick, with stones ad-
hering, was thrown ashore in a neighbouring gulf, and
is now in the possession of James Stewart, Esq. the pro-
prietor.  To the eye of a spectator who delights to con-
template the wild irregularities of Nature, there is every
where much entertainment.  In one place, the rocks raise
their bold brows, and stretch out as it were to bid defi-
ance to the fury of the ocean; in another, they seem to
shrink back, and are cut into immense caves and deep
gulfs, that threaten to undermine and tear in pieces the
whole island.  Its extremities are all of them high; the
middle part is lower, and more level; and the whole sur-
face of it, which amounts to about 1800 acres, except in
a very few spots, is covered with knolls or hillocks.  There
is, on the N. E. corner, a harbour for small craft, where
they lie in safety when the wind blows from any quarter
but N. E.; and for the greater security, they are fixed
