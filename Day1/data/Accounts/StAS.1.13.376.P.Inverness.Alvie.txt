     Statistical Account

Near the centre of the parish the river Fessie falls into the
Spey from the S. direct along which lies the second divi-
tion of the parish, extending Southward 6 miles, from 2 to
1/2 mile in breadth; but including the hills, the parish ex-
tends from N. to S. upwards of 20 miles.  The hills in
general are extremely barren, covered with heath, fre-
quently rocky; those to the S. of the Spey (the Grampians)
are much higher than those to the N. probably as high as
any in Scotland from the level of the sea, on whose tops
there is not the smallest vegetation; the interjacent val-
lies afford a plentiful and rich pasture in summer, but are
for the most part inaccessible in winter.  The hills did
abound in moorfowl, ptarmigan, and mountain hares, with
some deer and roe, which are exceedingly diminished of
late years, owing more to the inclemency of the weather
during the batching season, than the havock of the sports-
man.  The lower, or arable part of the parish, interlected
by the Spey for the Space of 2 miles, consists of a light,
dry soil, much incumbered with stones, lying on sandy
gravel, producing heavy crops of corn in a wet season, but
exceedingly parched in dry weather.

   Agriculture, etc.-The crops consist of oats, rye, barley,
and potatoes.  In general there is a sufficiency for the
subsistence of the inhabitants; the rent (all money) is paid
from the increase of the cattle.  There is only one farm
stocked wholly with sheep.  The late or early frosts seldom
fail to hurt the potatoes in some degree, which is a great
bar to the culture of that most useful root.  Seldom any more
than the third of the crop of peas is saved; it is only sown
by those who lime; the mildews frequently affect the oats
and bear; turnip is rarely sown beyond the garden.  There
is not so much flax raised as is sufficient for the consumption
of the inhabitants, owing to the bad services in the neigh-
