     Statistical Account

   There are several well frequented fairs kept on the muir ad-
joining to the town; the custom of one of them was purchas-
ed some time ago from the Earl of Strathmore, and all make
a considerable addition to the revenue of the burgh.  From Mar-
tinmas to Candlemass there is a weekly market on Wednesday,
free of custom, held on the street for the sale of fat cattle; and
during the feed-time there is one weekly on the same day for
the sale of work horses, all of which are well frequented, and
occasion the spending a great deal of money in the town, by
the country people who attend them*.

   Surface, Soil, etc.-The Landward Parish presents a level
prospect to the eye, intercepted only by the hill of Balnashi-
nar directly to the south of the town, part of which is within
the royaltry, and from the top almost the whole parish, as well
as a great extent of coutnry beyond it, may be seen at one view.
The west end of this hill is the place of execution of public
justice, and it is said that it derives its name in the Gaelic,
from the complaint of a Highland boy, following his grandfa-
ther, who had forfeited his life to the justice of his country.-
The soil is various.  To the north and south it is in general light
and thin, with a gravel bottom, as in the burgh land; about
the middle, from the east to west, spouty clay land.

<FOOTNOTE>

an act of the Scotch Parliament, in the reign of King James VI. changing its
weekly market day from Sunday to Friday, At what time is was changed
from Friday to Saturday, the incumbent has not been able to learn, but the
reason of the change has evidently been, that Friday interfered with the great
weekly market in Dundee, and that the other days in the week were kept as
fair days by the other towns in the shire.

*It is perhaps proper to take notice of the inconvenience which arises to
trading people, from the want of a proper and uniform standard of weights
and measures.  A pound of butter in Forfar is 24 English ounces; in Kirni-
muir 3 miles distant it is 27 ounces, the same difference obtains in cheese, and
a similar one in other articles.
