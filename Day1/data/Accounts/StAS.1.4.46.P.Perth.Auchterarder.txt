poorest class of people with it at a lower rate than the mar-

   The alternation in the dress and manner of living of the
inhabitants, within these 30 or 40 years, is not a little re-
markable.  Every body is now decently and comfortably
clothed, which perhaps was not the case then; and there
is now four times the quantity of butcher-meat used.  A-
bout 25 or 30 years ago, there was but two sixpenny wheat-
en loaves brought from Perth, to two private families, in
the week:  There is now a baker in the village, who sells
bread to the amount of L. 200 a-year, an about L. 80
worth is brought every year from Perth.  It must, how-
ever, be observed that the parishes of Blackford and Tri-
nity-Gask are in part supplied from Auchterarder.  A
house in the village of Auchterarder, consisting of 4 apart-
ments, with a garden, lets for about L. 4; and separate
rooms, with a small garden, let form 20 s. to 25 s.  There
are about 100 ploughs in the parish; many of them are four-
horse ploughs, and the rest two-horse ploughs.  Sometimes,
but rarely, 2 oxen are used, instead of 2 horses, next the
plough.  In the low part of the parish the tenants are im-
proving the breed of their horses, and among them the two-
horse plough generally prevails.  There are about 250 sin-
gle horse carts, and not one double horse cart.  An opinion
prevails, which is probably true, that the horses are more
equally wrought, in these rough and unequal roads, by
each having his own cart.
