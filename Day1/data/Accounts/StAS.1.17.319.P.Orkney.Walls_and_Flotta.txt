   Produce.-The quantity of kelp made yearly is about 80
tons, and costs from 1 L. 5 s. to 1 L. 10 s. per ton of 24 cwt.
for burning.  About 20 years ago, for the same quantity,
the prices were only from 15 s. to 20 s. or, on the very worst
shores, 1 L. 1 s.

   Fish.-The cod fishing here is extremely precarious; the
fish being some seasons remarkably plenty, and at others
equally scarce.  At some periods, for months together, there
will not be so many fish caught in a boat, as, on a division,
to be a fish for each man.  At other periods, on the same
ground, and in the same space of time, the boats will be
loaded as deep as they can swim.  From 50,000 to 70,000
cod have been often cured here in one season.
   When the fishing is good, there may be about 12 boats,
with 6 men each, that usually follow that business; at other
times, about half that number follow it occasionally.  Every
cod, measuring 14 inches and upwards, from the shoulder
fin to that next the tail, costs 2 d.  All under 14 inches to
11 inches cost 1 d. each.
   The lobster fishing is carried on in Orkney by about 60
boats with only two men to each boat.  At an average
they may catch about 2000 lobsters to each boat, making
annually from 100,000 to 120,000 fish, at 1 3/4 d. each.  The
number of boats have been constantly increasing for these
several years past, and are still increasing; but it is not like-
ly that the number of fish caught will be thereby increased:
For it is found by experience, that all the fish on any parti-
cular spot are soon picked up, and that, at the end of a fish-
ing season, they become very scarce every where.

   Poor.-The number of poor in the parish is, in ordinary,
about 20.  The annual collections seldom exceed 3 L. 10 s.
