     Fisheries.-Cod and herring-fishing are carried on by the peo-
ple of the parish in Holme Sound, and the adjacent sea. These
fisbings, however, have been very unproductive for some years
past.

          V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
     Ecclesiastical Estate.-The stipend amounts to L. 157,-of
which L. 97, 4s. 10d. is from parsonage teinds. The value of the
grebe is about L. 4 per annum.
     Education.-There is only one school in the parish, the paro-
chial. Salary of the master L. 26 per annum. He has also a
croft worth about L. 7 per annum. The parochial school was es-
tablisbed here, as in most other parishes of Orkney only about
thirty-five years ago. Rural employment of one kind or anothdr
occupies the youth from seven years of age upwards, during spring,
summer, and autumn,-and during that long vacation, they forget
what they bad acquired in the previous winter.
     Poor.-Average number of poor on the roll, 15. Average
amount of church collections in their behalf, about L-2; average
amount of other voluntary contributions, about L. 5, 10s. of mor-
tifications, mortcloth dues, &c. L. 9, 10s.
