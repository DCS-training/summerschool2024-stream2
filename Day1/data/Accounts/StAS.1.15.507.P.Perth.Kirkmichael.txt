     of Kirkmichael.

Glenshee is about 7 miles long, and less than a mile broad.
At the head of this glen are two smaller ones, narrow, and a-
bout 3 miles long.  The district bordering on the Black-wa-
ter, is of a form nearly circular, measuring somewhat more
than 2 miles in diameter.  Though this parish is pretty ex-
tensive, there is no part of it detached.  Its figure does not
vary much from a parallelogram, being 17 miles long from
North to South; and from 6 to 7 miles broad.

   Etymologies.-According to tradition, Strathardle was an-
ciently called in Gaelic, Srath na muice brice; the strath of
the spotted wild sow; which name it is said to have retained
till the time of the Danish invasions, when, in a battle sought
between the Danes and the Caledonians, at the head of the
country, a chief, named Ard-shuil, high, or noble blood, was
killed, whose grave is shown at this day.  From him the coun-
try got the name of Srath Ard-shuil, Strathardle, In tracing
the origin of the name of Glenshee, the following conjecture
is offered.  It appears to have been the practice among the
Druids, to hold assizes in the most convenient part of the
country, to decide differences and administer justice*.  The
persons who exercised this office were called Sith-dhaoine, or
Sithichean, peace-makers.  A round hill, at the head of the
glen, called Sith-dhun, the hill of peace, may have been one of
the places for holding these courts of justice; and hence the
whole glen may have got its name.  Another conjecture is,
that Sith dhun may have been the place of concluding and
ratifying a peace, between two contending tribes or clans.

   Hills, Lochs, etc.-A hill at the head of Glenshee, called
Beinn-Ghulbhuinn, is distinguished by having been the scene
