     Of Kilmuir Wester and Suddy.

Chatham.  Two have their family seats in the parish of Kil-
learnan, where their property is considerable; and one, Mr.
M'Kenzie of Pitlundy, one of the sheriff-substitutes of Ross,
lives on a farm belonging to Mr. Davidson of Tulloch, close
by the town of Dingwall.  Property has been, for several
years back, rather changeable; but no proprietor has been
introduced into the parish for upwards of 50 years, except
Mr Grant of Redcastle, and Sir Roderick M'Kenzie of Scat-
well, who sold his property in this parish to the Kilcoy fami-
ly; the rest of the property, to a considerable quantity of land,
that was sold, being bought up by the family of Kilcoy, who
is the largest proprietor, and principal heritor in this parish,
except a small property purchased of late by Colonel Graham
of Dryney.

   Language.-The Gaelic is the language commonly spoken
here; and though there are a few who have no Gaelic, yet
most of the inhabitants speak and understand both languages.
All the names of the heritors places of residence in this pa-
rish, are derived from the Gaelic:  Thus; Allangrange, or,
Allan-Chrain, "a fertile field of corn," Suddy; or Sui-us-sbin,
"a good place to settle in," Belmaduthy, or Ball-ma-duich,
"a good country town," or Ball-ma-duth, "a good black
"town," from its being situated hard by a black moor.

   Agriculture, etc.-Agriculture is, as yet, in this parish,
though a corn country, in a state of infancy:  excepting on the
proprietor's mains, and 1 farm, the rest all adhere to the old
mode of culture.  The heritors, who have all extensive mains,
are improving them with great judgement and spirit; but, be-
ing all young men, few or none of them have had sufficient
time to complete their pleasure ground, or bring their mains
to a proper state of cultivation, although they are making
