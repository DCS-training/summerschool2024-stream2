   Mills and Multures.-The parish is accommodated with
2 lint mills, 2 waulk mills, and 10 for grinding corn.  For
grain carried to the mill, the rate of multure varies from
1\11 to 1/3 and for what is sold unmanufactured 1/27 is general-
ly exacted, which is called dry or abstracted multure.  From
these mills, the heritors, who have their tenants restricted to
a certain mill, receive annually about 328 bolls of meal, part
of the rent in grain before mentioned.  To enable the tacks-
men to pay this mill rent, and to defray their own labour
and charges, the quantity of meal made annually in the pa-
rish, together with the grain sold unmanufactured, must be
from 7000 to 8000 bolls.
