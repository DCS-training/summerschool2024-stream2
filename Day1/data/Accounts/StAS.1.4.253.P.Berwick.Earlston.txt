     of Earlstoun.

   There is often a good show of black cattle in it, but no-
thing like what is in the June fair.  There are 4 public
houses in the parish.  But on the fairs, almost every low
house is a public one.
   One great disadvantage under which this parish labours,
is the want of fuel.  The common people burn turf and 
peat.  Those in the neighbourhood of Mellerstain are con-
veniently situated for fire-wood, which they get at a very
moderate rate.  The better fort of feuers and farmers burn
coal, which is usually from the neighbourhood of Dalkeith,
a carriage of about 24 or 25 miles, which necessarily makes
the price of coals so high, that the poor cannot purchase
them.  Lime is also carried about 22 miles, from which it
is likewise very high priced.
