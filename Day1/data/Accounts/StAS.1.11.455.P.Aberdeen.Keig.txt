     NUMBER XXXVII.

     PARISH OF KEIG.

     (County and Synod of Aberdeen-Presbytery of Alford.)

     By the Rev. Mr. ALEXANDER SMITH, Minister.

     Situation, Extent, Surface, and Soil.

   THIS parish is divided on the N. and E. by high hills,
from the parishes of Monymusk, Oyne, Premnay and
Lesly.  It is in form somewhat irregular, but compact; the
inhabited part of it extending from the church, in all direc-
tions, from 1 1/2 to 2 miles.  By surveys made of the different
estates, it contains 1704 acres arable, and 431 acres pasture
ground, besides a considerable extent of hills and moor, and
360 acres in wood, mostly natural.  As the arable ground
lies partly on the declivities of hills, and partly in a flat
country, intersected by the river Don, the soil is various,
and the surface unequal.  The hills are mostly covered with
heath, and afford tolerable pasture for sheep and black cattle,
of a shall breed.
