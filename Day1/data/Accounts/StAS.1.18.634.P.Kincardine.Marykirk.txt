occurs deserving any notice, is, that at Gallow-hillock, in
the time of the feudal system, there was a gallows erected,
on which those were hanged who displeased the proprietor.
The hillock or artificial mound (as it may be called), is visi-
ble, but the gallows was long ago removed; and happy-
happy should we think ourselves, that we live in better
times, when the greatest Lord in the land will not-nor dare
he molest us.

Comparative view of the value of land, mode of cultivation;
price of provisions; wages to servants; progress of man-
ners, from the year 1771, to the year 1795, with a re-
ference now and then, to more distant periods.
   In 1771, and for 10 years after, an estate sold at L. 6000
sterling, would in the present year 1795, nearly sell at twice
that sum.  In 1740, only at L. 3000; and in 1650, at less
than 2 years rents of the same ground the present year.
   In 1771, every farm was distinguished by In-field, and
Out field lands.  The latter far exceeded the former in extent,
and was sometimes in tillage; but for the most part in pas-
ture, while the former was manured and constantly in crop.
But now in 1795, the distinction between In-field and Out-
field is abolished; and grass-seeds are sown in almost every
part of the farm.
   In 1771, every field contained a number of baulks, where
nothing grew but natural grass; and which were deemed so
strong and rugged, that it appeared then impossible to plough
them.  In 1795, every baulk and obstacle is removed; and
the whole land in the field cultivated in proportion to the abi-
lity of the tenant.
   In 1771, in many places a quantity of land appeared crook-
ed in the figure of the letter S, very high in the middle of the
ridge, and consequently very unequal in breadth.  In 1795,
the ridges are all straighted and equally broad.
