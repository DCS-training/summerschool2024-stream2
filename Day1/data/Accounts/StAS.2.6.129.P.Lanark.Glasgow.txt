			 III.--POPULATION.
	There is no enumeration of the inhabitants of Glasgow that can
be relied on before the year 1610; but there are grounds for sup-
posing, that about the time of the Reformation, in 1560, the po-
pulation amounted to 4500.
	In 1610, the Episcopal mode of government having been resum-
ed in the church, Archbishop Spottiswood directed the population
of the city to be ascertained, when it was found to amount to 7644.
	In 1660, at the restoration of Charles II., the population amount-
ed to 14,678.
	In 1688, at the Revolution, the population had decreased to
11,948. The civil wars are assigned as the cause of the decrease,
and it is a curious historical fact, that the number fell off imme-
diately after the restoration of Charles II., and that it required
more than half a century to make up the defalcation.
	In 1708, immediately after the union with England, the popu-
lation amounted to 12,766. This enumeration was made by direc-
tion of the magistrates, to mark the falling off which they expected.
	In 1712, the population amounted to 13,832. This was made
by order of the Convention of Royal Burghs, directing each of the
burghs to make a return of its population on oath.
	In 1740, the population was ascertained by the magistrates to
be 17,034.
	In 1755, the population had increased to 23,546, but this enu-
meration included persons living in houses which had been built
adjoining to, but without the royalty. At that period, the magis-
trates directed returns to be made for the Rev. Dr Webster, then
preparing his scheme for the Ministers' Widows Fund.
	In 1763, the population amounted to,28,306. This enumera-
tion was drawn up by Mr John Woodburn, the city surveyor.

	It was very fortunate, in a statistical point of view, that the pestilence did not visit
this city when the Government census was taken, otherwise the data for ten  year
would have been rendered more indistinct and less suitable for the formation of	tables
for exhibiting the probability of human life in large towns. The paper of which the
preceding is an abstract, was prepared by James Cleland, LL. D. Member of the
Board of Health, one of his Majesty's justices of the peace for the county of Lanark,
and by James Corkindale, M. D., LL. B., Medical Secretary to the Board of Health.
