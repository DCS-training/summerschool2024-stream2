   Lime is universally used as a manure.  The first time
ground is limed, it is usual to lay each acre, from 50 to 70 or
even, 80 measures, more or less, in proportion to the heaviness
or lightness of the soil*. Sleech, of sea sand, is used as a sub-
stitute of lime, by those nearsest the shore.

meantime, it gives the friend of the busbandman pleasure to observe, that hither-
to, with the advancement of his rent, the price of the productions of the soil, his
activity, his intelligence, and his happiness, seem to have advanced.

*Upon land that has never ploughed before, the line is not laid un-
til it be first broken by the plough and harrow; but, if it has been tilled be-
fore, it is thought better to spread it on the grass surface; and experience
proves, that it is advantageous to allow the lime to lie a year on the ground,
before ploughing it down.  If it be ploughed down immediately, the farmer
reaps no benefit from the line for the first crop.
