     Statistical Account

and has several fields of good meadow on its banks.  About
the half of the sea shore in the parish is plain and sandy, the
rest rocky, but low.  Green links, and some patches of bent,
lie immediately above the whole course of this coast; which
affords some kelp, and abundance of shell-sand and sea-ware,
for manure.  On it stand two fishing villages, employing 6 or
7 boats each.  The fish caught here are the same species men-
tioned in the account of Fraserburgh, and disposed of in the
same manner.-The air is sharp, though the people in
general cannot be said to be unhealthy.  Putrid and nervous

not make so much havock as usual, except among the fishers,
who will not adopt that preventive mode.

   Rent, Cultivation, etc.-The parish belongs to ten diffe-

is L. 3520 Scotch; the real about L 2000 sterling, paid part
in money and part in victual, with some customs, bondages,
and personal services, though the three last are gradually les-
sening here.  The inhabitants in general, except the fisher-
men, and a few old and decayed persons, who reside in soli-
tary cottages, are all, in some degree, farmers.  The several
tradesmen, and others of different employments, possess each
a field, which they generally improve.  Upwards of three-
fourths of the parish, however, is occupied by real farmers,
who of late, having adopted a better mode of culture than
what prevailed formerly, have improved their possessions con-
siderably.  Yet still much may be done.  Near the coast, the
