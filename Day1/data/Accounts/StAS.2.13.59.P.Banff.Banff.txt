5 Years,

    The system now described was first adopted in 1817, chiefly with
a view to the suppression of common street begging, an end which
it has effectually enough answered,-though by no means so as to
supersede the necessity for private almsgiving, and occasional col-
lections for special cases of distress; and, taken generally, as a plan
of pauper management, its operation appears to have been, on the
whole, satisfactory.
    It is, however, a circumstance well worth remark, that an addi-
tional annual expenditure since the year 1824 of nearly L. 300
(from Cassie's bounty, as already described,) has bad so far from
a proportional effect in lessening the amount required to be raised
otherwise. Few or none, indeed, of the persons on the general
poor's fund are those who are receiving, at the same time, an al-
lowance from Cassie's bequest. But the latter class of persons,
being only the next above the former, and that from which the ranks
of the regular poor may he supposed to be filled,-the two funds
may, in estimating the effect of an increased provision for the poor,
be set down as one. It would, of course, be an error to say that
Cassie's bounty has not been productive of benefit: it must, to its
extent, have saved distress or privation that would have been other-
wise felt: but an additional proof has been afforded by it, in the
present instance-if, indeed, experience were needed to prove what
may be pronounced before hand-that an increase of funds for the
maintenance of the poor will not lesson the number of the poor.

<FOOTNOTE>For the last two years there have generally been three services in the church each
Sunday, and a resident heritor's contribution to the collections.
    The average sum expended by the Poors' Committee for eight years, 1817-24,
was L. 327 ; number of poor, 156; average surn for five year, 1831-35, L. 216; num-
ber, 95; making only a reduction of L. 111 on the sum, 61 on the number. It is be-
lieved, too, that it is not so much a lessening of the demand as of the supply that oc-
casions even this difference- several families who were liberal cnntributors having
died away or removed.
