   Stipend, School, Poor.-The stipend consists of 80 bolls
meal and bear, and 500 merks money, amounting, with a
glebe of 6 acres, to about L. 80 Sterling.  The church and
manse are old, but were lately repaired.  The King is patron.
   The school was rebuilt, and the schoolmaster's house re-
paired, 6 years ago.  His salary including a donation of
L. 20 Scots, is L. 8: 6: 4 Sterling.  His perquisites about as
much.  He values the whole of his income at about L. 40
Sterling.-Only 6 poor persons receive alms at present, and
the only fund provided for their maintenance, is the week-
ly collections at the church-door, which are very small;
there is not however, a travelling beggar in the parish.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Every person almost that is
not engaged in the labours of the field is employed at the
loom.  A considerable quantity of coarse linen is made in
the parish, which is sold brown, and some also of a better
quality, which is bleached and sold at the summer markets
in the neighbourhood, to merchants from Edinburgh, Stir-
ling, etc. at from 1 s. 6 d. to 3 s. the yard.  All are re-
markably sober, industrious, and economical, so that even
the dearth of 1783 had no visible effect upon the poorest
