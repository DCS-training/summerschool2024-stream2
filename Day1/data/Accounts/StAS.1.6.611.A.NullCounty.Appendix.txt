happened for a still further increase.  Yet, many of them riot
on Sunday, are idle all Monday, and can afford to do this on
five days labour.
   In 1763-The clergy visited, catechised, and instructed
the families within their respective parishes, in the principles
of morality, Christianity, and the relative duties of life.
   In 1783-Visiting and catechising were disused (except
by a very few), and since continue to be so:  Nor, perhaps,
would the clergy now be received with welcome on such an
occasion.  If people do not choose to go to church, they may
remain as ignorant as Hottentoss, and the Ten Commandments
be as little known as obsolete acts of parliament.-Religion is
the only tie that can restrain, in any degreen, the licentiousness
either of the rich, or of the lower ranks; when that is lost, se-
rocity of manners, and every breach of morality may be ex-

   In 1763-The breach of the seventh commandment was
punished by fine and church-censure.  Any instance of con-
jugal infidelity in a woman would have banished her irretriev-

   In 1783-Although the law punishing adultery with death
was unrepealed, yet church-censure was disused, and separa-
tions and divorces were become frequent, and have since in-
creased*. Women, who had been rendered infamous by pub-
lic divorce, had been, by some people of fashion, again re-
ceived into society, notwithstanding the endeavours of our
worthy Queen to check such a violation of morality, decency,
