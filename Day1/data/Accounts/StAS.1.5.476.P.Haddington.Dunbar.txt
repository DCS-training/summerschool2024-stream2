     Statistical Account

ling.  The Duke of Roxburgh has a small house at Brox-
mouth, pleasantly situated.  Sir Peter Warrander has 
Lochend.  Nineware belongs to Mr Hamilton of Bangour,
and Belton to Mr Hay.  Mr Anderson has a small house
beautifully situated at Winterfield, from the summer house
of which there is a delightful prospect, very extensive,
and much diversified.  The Earl of Lauderdale has built
a very elegant house at the W. end of Dunbar.

   Villages, Rivers, Mills, etc.-There are five villages in
the parish, viz. Belhaven, within the royalty, West Barns,
Hedderwick, East Barns, and Pinkerton.-There are two
rivers; both have their source in Lammermuir hills.  The
largest of these is the Tyne, which, after a pretty long
course, empties itself into the Frith of Forth at Tyn-
inghame.  There the tide flows about two miles, and has de-
stroyed on both sides of the river several acres of good land,
which Dutch skill and industry would have preserved.
The other river is the Biel, which runs by Whittinghame,
the Bield, Belton, and West Barns, and empties itself into
the Frith at Bielmouth.  On this river, at the village of
West Barns, a cotton and flax mill is just now begun to be e-
rected, from which we have great expectations.  The cot-
ton manufacture is at present one of the most flourishing
and useful branches of commerce in Britain.  It employs a
number of hands, and especially young people.  This mill
is a new thing in this county, and, if it succeeds, will be a
great blessing to this corner.  It is generally esteemed a pa-
triotic attempt, and has the good wishes of every person of
public spirit.-At West Barns, there are flour mills of the
best sort, where a considerable quantity of wheat and bar-
ley is manufactured.  There are three other corn mills in
the parish.  To these mills, the town and some estates in
the country are thirled; a wretched piece of police!
