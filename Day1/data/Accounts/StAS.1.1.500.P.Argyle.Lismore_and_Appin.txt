     Statistical Account

and a great quantity of slates are sent yearly to the north and 
east countries, to Leith, Clyde, England, Ireland, and even
to America.  Vessels of any burden can load most commo-
diously in fine smooth sand, so near the shore, that they may
be loaded by throwing a few planks between the vessels and
the shore; and there is little or no swell in the road.  The
quality of the slates is thought very good.  Burning of lime
for sale has been begun by adventurers in Lismore and Ap-
pin; and, as the lime is of a most superior quality, this un-
dertaking might turn out to advantage, not only to the ad-
ventures, but to the public at large, as an encouragement to
building, husbandry, etc. were it not for the check given to
it by the coal duty.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.  The principal advantage in
these parishes is the vast extent of sea-coast, with bays and
inlets.  The snow seldom lies deep or long on the sea-cost,
a circumstance highly favourable to sheep and black cattle.
The good roads and bridges in Appin are of great and general
utility.  Beats are the common fuel of the country, but they
take up the very best part of the season to secure them.  The
frequent rains here often destroy some of this part of the far-
mer's industry.  The duty on coals is the greatest dis-
advantage these parishes labours under, and prove an unsur-
mountable bar to manufactures and improvements of all sorts.
The want of public established markets is likewise a great dis-
advantage.  A ton of coals cofts from 18 s. to 21 s. and 24 s.
The duty on salt is likewise a great grievance, as managed at
present, and requires to be remedied.  The trouble of preparing,
and the time consumed by the inhabitants in securing their fuel,
in Lismore in particular, where attention to their crops and til-
lage, would take up all the labour they could spare, is a most
serious grievance and to be remedied only by an alteration
