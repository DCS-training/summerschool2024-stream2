   These funds, with the collections made at the doors of the pa-
rish church and of the chapels, with dues on mortcloths and pri-
vate baptisms, were for a long time the only constant sources of
income for the workhouse. Occasionally, indeed, private dona-
tions were received; and, for some time, a benefit play was grant-
ed every year by the managers of the Edinburgh Theatre.
   But the population of the parish increasing without any propor-
tionate increase of wealth, the income derived from these sources
proved insufficient for defraying the expense of the establishment;
and it was thought necessary to raise money by an assessment.
The assessment first imposed was, in the year 1812, at the rate
of 6d. on every pound Sterling of rent, one-half to be paid by the
landlord and one-half by the tenant, and it continued at this rate
for five years; but afterwards it was altered several times. Thus,
in the year 1817, the rate per pound Sterling of rent was 8d.;
1819, 1s.; 1820, 8d.; 1826, 1s.; 1827, 1s. 2d.; 1930, 1s, 4d.
1832, 1s. 6d.; 1844, 1s. 6d.
   The assessment, with the church collections, work done in the
house, and other items, amounted in 1844 to L. 1164. The
average number of inmates for the same year was 97; of out-pen-
sioners 186. The maintenance of each inmate amounts to L. 5,
13s. 8d. annually. The pauper lunatics of the parish are boarded
at Morningside Asylum.
   St Cuthbert or West Church.-This parish, which is one of the
largest and wealthiest in Scotland, contained in 1841 a population
of 71, 904. The number of paupers belonging to it, as at 1st
August 1845, amounts to 2116,-consisting of 1666 out-door poor,
385 maintained in the parish workhouse, and 65 lunatics. Of the
whole paupers, not more than about one-fifth are natives of the
parish.
   The funds for the support of the poor are, 1st, The collections
at the doors of the Established Church and Chapels of Ease con-
nected therewith, which have for several years past been decreas-
ing. These amount annually to about L. 130, 2d, The proceeds
of mortcloth dues, which are also on the decrease. There are
besides these some mortifications or legacies of mortmain, pro-
ducing yearly about L. 20. 8d, The assessment on the rental of
the farish, at the rate, for the last four-years, of tenpence per
