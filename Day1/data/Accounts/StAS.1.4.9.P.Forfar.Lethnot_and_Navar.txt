of the native breed when full grown, sells at 10 s. 6 d. or
11 s. and the Yarrow kind brings 14 or 15 s.  It is obser-
ved here, that the nature of the sheep's pasture greatly af-
fects the wool.  A farm where there is much wet marshy
ground, and that rough kind of grass which grows on such
ground, always produces coarse wool.
   The finest wool is produced, where the sheep have young
tender heath, and short sweet grass to feed upon.
   The disease formerly mentioned under the name of
Braxes, in this place, proves fatal to many of the young
sheep.  It seizes them towards the end of harvest, when
they are in best condition, and the most thriving are cut off
by it.  When their bodies are opened, the blood is found
extravasated intheir bowels, and in a putrid state.  It ap-
pears to be infections; for when the disease begins, num-
bers perish, and they are cut off by a short illness.  No me-
thod is found so effectual for stopping the progress of the
malady, as removing the sheep to a pasture at some distance.
When the young sheep are carried to a distant pasture, it
is some time before they become acquainted with it, so that
for a few days at least, they must be but half-fed.  This
consideration induced an ingenious man in a neighbouring
parish, to confine his young sheep a good part of every day
within their pens, at the time when the Braxes began to
make its appearance, that they might be prevented from
filling their stomachs, when attacked by it, and this precau-
tion had the desired effect in saving their lives.  There
are others who say, that they have tried this precaution
without success.

   Horses and black cattle.-The number of horses within
the parishes is 147:  many of them are of a small size, only
a little larger than the Shetland breed.  The number of
black cattle is 601.  The number of calves reared annually
