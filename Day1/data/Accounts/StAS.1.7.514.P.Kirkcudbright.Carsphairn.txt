years ago wood had abounded; now any that remains scarce-
ly deserves to be mentioned.  Iron ore might be found in a-
bundance, and formerly iron mines were wrought; but dis-
continued as soon as the wood for charcoal was exhausted.
Were the working of iron to be again resumed, it is proba-
ble from the expence of coal, and the great distance to any
sea-port, it would yield but little profit.  Almost all the
springs are chalybeates, some of which are excellent; but as
they lie remote from any habitation, it is probable they never
will be frequented.

than in the lower parts of the county; and as the situation is
high, and the grounds in most places wet, the air must be
comparatively moist, yet it is extremely salubrious.  Epide-
mics are rarely known.  An intermittent never was a na-

by the cattle drivers, when they return from the fens of
England; and in a variety of instances it has been observed,
that the disease did not make its appearance for several weeks
after the infection had been received.  Other fevers here are
