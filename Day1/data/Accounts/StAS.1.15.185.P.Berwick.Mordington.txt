their coals brought home, and several other perquisites, the
whole of which may amount to 16 L. a year.  Day-labourers
commonly receive 1 s. 4 d. per day in summer, and 1 s. in win-
ter, except in hay-time, and during harvest, when there is a
considerable advance in their wages.  Those who take work
by the piece generally earn a considerable deal more.  There
has, for these some years past, been a gradual rise on the price
of labour for weeding turnips, probably owing to the gradu-
al extension of the turnip-husbandry, which requires a great-
er number, and consequently makes a greater demand for la-
bourers.  The wages are now 10 d. per day; whereas, a
years ago, they seldom exceeded 6 d.  This species of labour
is generally performed by women and boys, who are very
expert at it.

   Roads-The great post road from Edinburgh to London,
by Berwick and Newcastle, runs through the East side of this
parish.  The road from Dunse to Berwick passes through
the South part of it.  This, as well as all the other great and
leading roads through Berwick shire, is made and repaired
by the money which is levied at toll-bars, which have lately
been erected.  The institution of turnpikes has been of the
greatest utility to this country.  Formerly, the roads were of-
ten in such a situation, as to render impossible, either for car-
riages or horses to get through; whereas, there is now an
open and an easy communication, at all seasons of the year,
for horses and carriages of every description.  The
roads are also in a rapid state of improvement; they are
made and up-held by the statute labour, which is commuted.

   Heritors, Rent, etc.-There are only two heritors in
this district, both of whom reside.  The real rent of the pa-
rish is about 2000 L. Sterling.  The valued rent is 2,045 L.
18 s. 6 d. Scotch.  The monthly cess is 32 L. 14 s. 8 d. Scotch.
