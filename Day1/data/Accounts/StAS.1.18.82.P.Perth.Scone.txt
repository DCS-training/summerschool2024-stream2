now a hamlet, bearing that name; and it is said, that there,
in former times, there was a bridge over the river, and that
several large beams of oak, yet to be seen under the water,
formed a part of it.
   About a quarter of a mile up the river from this place, are
the vestiges, it is supposed, of an encampment.  It is a spot
of ground inclosed, on the west, by the Tay; and on the
other sides, by a fosse.  Its figure is nearly an oblong, and its

the attention of almost every traveller, is Scone.  This being
anciently the residence of our kings, and the scene of the
most interesting and splendid actions, some account of it
must be expected by the reader.  At the Reformation the
mob, from Dundee and Perth, impelled by their aversion to
Popery, and by private resentment, as well as the hope of
