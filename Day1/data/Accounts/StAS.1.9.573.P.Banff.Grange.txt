but only thatched with heath, which is a bad roof.  The
stipend is 1000 merks Scots in money, and 25 1/2 bolls of
meal, at 8 stone, including L. 4, 4, s. for communion-ele-
ments; and a glebe of 5 acres, of tolerably good soil.
Sir William Forbes of Cragievar, Bart. is patron.  The
schoolmaster's salary is 12 bolls of meal, collected in lip-
