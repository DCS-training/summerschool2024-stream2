     of Birse.

Both are delightfully situated, being encircled with hills and
woods.  The proprietor of Midstrath has not for some time
resided, consequently the mansion house is almost a ruin.
The house of Ballogie is sitted up with taste by the pro-
prietor, who resides.  In its neighbourhood, and on the public
road that passes through the parish from E. to W. is the
neat little village of Marywell, where they are improving
the fields, and building neat small houses under the auspices
of Mr Innes the proprietor.  Directly west on the banks
of the Chattie is Glenchatt, partly cultivated, and partly
set apart for pasture.  The most northerly district is along
the south side of the Dee; through it runs the burn of Birse.
In it is Balfour, where a small heritor resides.  The church
and manse are there situated, very inconveniently for the
greater part of the parish.  This district is about 2 1/2 miles
long, and 1 1/2 broad.  It is vulgarly called the Six Towns.
The whole parish is divided into what was called 24 towns;
and in the opinion of some skilful men, each town may
contain from 80 to 85 acres arable.  Upon this supposition,
there may be reckoned about 2000 acres and upwards un-
der cultivation, exclusive of the Forest, where there are now
120 acres and odds under cultivation.  The number of
acres under wood in the parish may be equal to the num-
ber under cultivation.  No trees, however, grow in what
is called the Forest; yet there is reason to believe, that it
once produced a great deal of various forts, particularly hol-
ly.  In some old houses in the parish, some wood that grew
in the Forest still remains; tradition says, that the remain-
der of the wood growing in the Forest was consumed by
fire.  The nearest farm to the Forest is called Woodend.
To the parish belong in property, or at least by servitude,
four forests or glens; in all of which, probably wood has
been produced, namely Glen-Birse, Glen-Aven, Glenchatt,
and Glensleudrum.
