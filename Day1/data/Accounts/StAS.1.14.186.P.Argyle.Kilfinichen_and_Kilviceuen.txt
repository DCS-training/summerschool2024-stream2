work were thrown flat on the ground  In the begin-
ning of harvest 1786, some of the herring fishers in
Lochscridain received a shock by lightning, but felt no
inconvenience from it afterward  It is said, that at

   Caves.-Among the many caves in Airdmeanach 2
only deserve to be mentioned.  One is called the Lad-
der's Cave.  There is a passage to this cave of about 80

meaneach, and is still much more capacious than the
Ladder's Cave.  It took its name, as tradition goes, from
a gentleman of the name of M'Kinnon going in to search
for the bottom, which was then thought impossible to find,
as the cave was supposed to go quite across the country.
M'Kinnon went in, and was never heard of again  But

he was.  So that if there is any truth in M'Kinnon's
story, he must have been killed by people who took
shelter in the cave; and as the people of the country
