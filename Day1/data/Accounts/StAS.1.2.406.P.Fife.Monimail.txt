tudes are few and dying away.  Those that continue, such as as-
sistance with carriages, etc. during the hayand corn harvests, are
rather voluntary and discretionary than exacted.-The ge-
neral character of the parishioners has always been, that they
are industrious, regular, quiet, and respectable.  There are
mixtures in the purest societies, but this character is still me-
rited by the present race in Monimail.
