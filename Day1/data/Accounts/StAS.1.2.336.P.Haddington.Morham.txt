ing a good deal to clay, is not favourable to the culture of tur-
nips and potatoes: both, however, are raised in a moderate
degree, the last to the greatest extent; as, besides what the
tenant raises for himself, every cottager, is by bargain, or
favour, allowed to plant a certain quantity for the use of his
family.  They esteem this root both a plesant and nutritious
food; and it is one of the principal articles, on which they
subsist, for a considerable part of the year.  Excellent crops of
all kinds of grain are raised; but the modes of croping are va-
rious, adapted to the varieties of the soil.  The greatest im-
provement is that of turning the land frequently, for a few
years, into pasture.  It is found to be the best restorative, where
adventitious manure cannot be had.  Lime, of which there is
great plenty, at the distance of 3 or 4 miles, is still moderately
used.  But lime, being a stimulus, and not a manure,
has not the same advantageous effect, when frequently re-
peated.
   As agriculture is the prevailing, and almost the only occu-
pation in the parish, and the whole of the grounds being ara-
ble, there are a great many ploughs, in proportion to the extent
of the district.  The number kept by the tenants, is about
20; and, as they uniformly plow with two horses, the quan-
tum of draught horses, can be easily ascertained; but, besides
these, there are many young horses bred, as the high price they
bring at market has tempted most of the tenants to rear to dealers,
   There are no sheep bred in the parish; but a considera-
ble quantity are sed in the inclosed pasture grounds for slaugh-
ter.
