rection of the canal is under a Governor, Council in Lon-
don, and a Committee at Glasgow, who meet monthly.
They are chosen annually, by a general meeting, which is

   The extensive trade carried on through this canal sug-
gested to Sir Lawrence Dundas the propriety of building a
village and quay near the east end of it on his own estate.
The place which he fixed upon for this purpose was the
angle which is formed by the junction of the river Carron
and the canal.  They were begun to be built in the year
1777; the village is now of considerable extent, and is call-
ed Grangemouth.
   Vessels bring into this port timber and hemp, deals, flax,
and iron, from the Baltic, Norway, and Sweden, and grain
from foreign markets, as well as from the coasts of Scot-
land and England.  The trade to London is carried on by
the Carron Shipping Company, who in their vessels con-
vey to that place goods which are made at Carron, together
with other articles of commerce; and when they return,
they bring grocery goods, dye-stuffs, etc. for the supply of
Glasgow, Paisley, Greenock, Falkirk, Stirling, and many
of the inland towns of the west country.
   The tonnage at this port is, at a medium, nearly as fol-
lows: Vessels belonging to England, which bring cargoes

England, which carry on a coasting trade, about 4000 tons
annually; those belonging to Scotland, which are employed
in foreign traffic, about 10,000 tons annually; those which
carry on the coasting trade are about 9000 tons annually;
the Carron Shipping Company require about 9360 tons;
the vessels belonging to foreign nations, which come annu-
ally to Grangemouth, may be estimated in their tonnage
