Head, and other lesser parcels, which are bare and rocky, and
part of the farms upon the edges of the common moor, which
are of a coarse and cold soil, and excepting also the far great-
est part of that moor itself, which, in its natural state, produ-
ces nothing but heath on the dry parts, and bent, and the
coarsest sort of grass on the swampy wettish parts.  This
great common was, about 20 years ago, divided by the Court
of Session among the heritors having interest therein, after
much litigation, and at the expense of 1500 L. and upwards;
considerable improvements, by enclosing, draining, and lim-
ing, have been made thereon, by several of the heritors.  But
it is believed few of them will find those improvements turn
out to their advantage, as the soil is, in most parts, thin, mar-
shy, and of the mossy kind, and the bottom of a tough, cold
bluish clay.  The general opinion seems to be, that the best
use that it can be turned to, is by planting it.  There are se-
veral peat mosses in this extensive moor; but few of the peats
are of the black hard kind: they are generally of a brownish
colour, soft and porous, anti burn away in a blaze, are fitter
for kindling than lasting fires, and as such they are now com-
monly used.  The mosses themselves being much worn out,
the digging anti drying the peats has become more difficult
and expensive, and they are now, from different causes, in a
good measure, deserted, although peats and turfs were the
principal fuel used in this parish from the earliest times; and
this accounts for the barrenness and sterility of the moor, as
the surface must have been repeatedly paired and carried off
by the inhabitants, in the course of many ages.
