rises to the south, and declines towards the north; still the slope is
so gentle, that very little of it can be said to have a northern ex-
posure. The trap ridges seldom attain any great altitude, except
at Stron and Birhill on the east, where the elevated peak, and
the abrupt precipitous crag, often assume an alpine appearance.
The range of the Campsie Fells on the north, rising often to the
height of 1500 feet, affords a friendly shelter from the biting winds
of the north; so that the district, upon the whole, exhibits a happy
combination of alpine wildness, and of pastoral simplicity; yet en.
joying all the advantages of a rich and arable country.
   Most of the farmerp in the district, from necessity and interest,
are great observers of the times and seasons, and many of them
have notes, very accurately and copiously kept, of the state of the
weather, particularly at the two most important epochs of the year,
seed-time and harvest; not only during their own experience, but
also during the lifetimes of their fathers and grandfathers. Subjoin-
ed are some of the principal of these observations in an abridged
form. These rural annals extend as far back as the beginning of
the eighteenth century, and relate chiefly to the seasons. *

<FOOTNOTE>The seven ill-years, as they are called, seem to have ended about 1704. On the
27th November preceding, one of the most terrible storms ever known devastated a
great part of England, and did much damage in Scotland. In 1709, there were three
months of very severe frost, with heavy snows. 1712 was a wet season, with a great
flood in harvest. 1714 was very dry; a great frost in 1716; 1723 remarkably dry,
no rain till 26th October. 1725 very wet; snow remarkably deep in 1731 and 1736.
However, from 1730 to 1740, the seasons were in general very favourable, only some
shaking in 1739. The year 1733 was the year of tile great hail which happened
when all the crops were in ear. It commenced in Galloway, and skirted along the
counties of Ayr and Lanark, did much damage in Renfrew and Dumbarton, and
broke in a great waterspont in the Campsie Hills. This dreadful storm carried de-
vastation with it wberever it went. One farmer out of all his crops had only
three bear-heads left, which happened to be sheltered by a great mugwort bush.
The severe frost of 1740 is still spoken of. It in reality commenced in December
1739, and continued nine weeks, or a huundred nd three days; a very had crop fol-
lowed, with an early frost in harvest. It was in January 1739 that the windy Satur-
day happened, or exactly a hundred years before the dreadful hurricane of January
1839. An early and good crop in 1742, rendered memorable by the Cambuslang
work; a great hail in May 1745. The preceding harvest was very wet; the crop
greatly injured. The harvest of 1745 also very bad, great rains and heated stocks.
From 1746 to 1749 all the crops were good, and meal cheap. 1750, a dry summer, a
wet August, but a good harvest; 1751-52, medium seasons; meal 10 1/2. and 11d. per
peck. 1753, light crop, early and dry. 1754, a good crop, preceded by a long and
severe frost in winter. 1755, wet seed-time, bad crop, late harvest with frost. 1756,
wet late harvest, with a light crop, much shaking; meal rose to 1s. 6d. per peck.
1757, rather dry and early, but corn yielded bot little meal, which sold at 1s. per
peck. 1758, remarkably good season and fine crop; meal 7 1/2d. per peck. 1759-60-
61, were medium seasons; meal low, but in 1761 it rose to 1s. per peck. 1762, snow-
ed eleven days togethe, late seed-time, dry summer, much corn, fodder scanty.  1763,
a frost, which lasted ninety four days, rest of the season favourable, with a tolerable
crop; 1764,backward season, and crop rather below mediocrity; 1765, early sea-
son, but frost and much rain in harvest. 1766, good seed-time, wet summer, good
harvest, corn good in quality. 1767, medium season and crop, first half of barvest
