tical Account of Scotland, express their satisfaction in the comple-
tion of the important work which the Society and the Clergy have
thus provided for the benefit of the country: and regarding both the
intention of the work and the care and intelligence which the Cler-
gy have employed in its preparation as in the highest degree credit-
able to them and to the Society, they trust that a recompense
for their labours will be found in its acknowledged usefulness, by
illustrating as it does the state and resources of the country; and
they would hope that its success otherwise may be so great as to
afford some benefit to the fund under the management of the So-
ciety.
