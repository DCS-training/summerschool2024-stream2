heritors, and partly to the negligence or incapacity of the
builders, it is superficial to the last degree.  Upon the least
blast, it draws water from every quarter, and overflows the
rooms.  This renders the house extremely damp, and con-
sequently dangerous to health.  The stipend is exactly 1000
merks, including sacramental elements.  The glebe, about
14 Scotch acres, is partly arable, and partly fit for pasture.
There is a process for an augmentation going on.  Sir John

   Proprietors.-The heritors are 7 in number, viz. Lord
Roseberry, Sir John Dalrymple, Thomas Adinston of Car-

None reside in the parish.

   School.-The school-master's salary is 100 merks.  The
average number of scholars is 10.  The smallness of the
number is owing to the age and infirmity of the teacher,
who is above 70 years of age; to his ignorance of the lan-
guages, and particularly to his want of a school-house.  He
has only a small cottage, and an area of about 8 feet

this is crammed with tables, forms, and other house-
hold stuff, as the school-master has no place else to
lodge them.  This want of accommodation greatly affects
the emoluments of the teacher, and the education of the
youth of the parish.  The fees for teaching to read English
are 1 s., writing and arithmetic 1 s. 6 d. the quarter.  He is
also precentor, session-clerk, beadle, grave-digger, and yet
his whole income does not exceed L. 8 Sterling per annum.
This, with the paltry accommodation, holds out little en-
couragement to a teacher of any merit.  Indeed, no man
who possesses strength to lift a mattock, or to weild a flail,
