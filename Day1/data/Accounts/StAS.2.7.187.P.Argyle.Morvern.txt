   The language generally spoken in the	parish is Gaelic, which
has not lost ground, though English has made some advances.
The two languages seem about to form a friendly alliance, and to
co-exist on the same terms of amity which, here at least, happily
characterize the intercourse of the parties by whom they are se-
verally spoken.
   There are still, no doubt, many traits of national character ex-
hibited among the native population; but these peculiarities are
fast fading away, and even now are discernible only to those who
enjoy unrestrained intercourse with them, in the hour of festive,
mirth, and in the season of sorrow and distress.  It is only during
holiday times that any of the popular games, such as shinty, are to
any extent indulged in, and even then the weight of care seems to
impede activity.  The year is still ushered in on the 12th January,
with not a few of the peculiar observances of the olden times.  The
people, in general, are disposed to be cleanly ; but it is to be regret-
ted, that very frequently the construction of their houses and other
causes have a counteracting effect.  Their ordinary food is simple
in the extreme, consisting chiefly of milk, fish, &c. and, above all,
potatoes, in the Highlands, at least, the staff of life.  Indeed, there
are many, it is feared, much in the predicament of a little boy of
the parish, who, on being asked on a certain occasion of what his
three daily meals consisted, gave the same unvarying answer,-
" Mashed potatoes;" and on being farther asked by his too in-
quisitive inquirer, "What else?" replied, with great artlessness,
but with evident surprise, "A spoon !" , The poor people how-
over, are on the whole patient, if not contented.  They are not
remarkable for habits of continued industry, but they are so for
strict frugality.  They are backward in making high professions
