     Statistical Account

There are 4 alehouses, who have taken out a licence, all in the
village.  No very bad effects, on the morals of the inhabitants,
have yet been felt from them; but many suspect, that this will
not long be the case.-The difference betwixt employing cotta-
gers and hired servants, in agriculture, cannot be ascertained
here, few or none in the parish, having employed the former.
-There is no jail in the parish; or were any of the parishion-
ers in prison, during the year 1790.  Indeed there has been
no justiciary trials of any of the people of this parish, for these
30 years, one excepted, who was punished by whipping.-
The people in general, are of a middle size;-healthy in their
constitution;-decent in their conduct,-and, though they may
have some real, and some imaginary grievances, yet they are
as much contented with their state, as most of their neigh-
bours.
