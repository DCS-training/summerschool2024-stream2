  The practice of killing salmon by the spear and torch is here
carried on to a great extent, especially during close-time, and the
numbers of foul fish that are annually taken in this way are very
considerable.  Poaching for game is also practised, though not to
the same extent.
     During the last three years there have been 20 illegitimate
births; but in 8 of the cases, the parties were afterwards married.

                           IV.--INDUSTRY.
     Agriculture.--The system of husbandry pursued here is in all
respects similar to that of the surrounding districts.  The five-
shift rotation of cropping is that which is generally followed, and
the common duration of leases is nineteen, and varying from that
to fifteen years.
     The rent of the arable land varies of course with the quality of
the soil,--in snme cases reaching as high as L. 4, and in others de-
scending to 12s. per acre.  The average rent, however, of all the
arable land in the parish may be stated at L. 1, 3s. per acre.  The
real rent of the parish is L. 8698.
     Rate of Wages.--A farm-servant's wage, every thing included,
averages L. 28 per annum; that of a labourer 1s. 8d. per day in
summer, and 1s. 6d. in winter; of a carpenter 2s., and of a mason
2s. 6d. per day.  Single men residing in the farmer's house receive
from L. 7 to L. 8, and women from L. 6 to L. 7 per annum, vic-
tuals included.
     Live-Stock.--The kind of live-stock generally reared in this pa-
rish is what is commonly called the sbort-horned breed of cattle,
and the Leicester breed of sheep, or a cross between the Leicester
and Cheviot breeds.  And the rate of grazing is as follows:  A
cow, L. 3, 10s.; a three year old, L. 2, 10s.; a two year old, L. 2;
and a year old, L. 1, 10s. each: and a ewe, L. 1 per annum.
