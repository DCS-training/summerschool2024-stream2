   Poor.-The poor of this place have greatly increased with-
in these 50 years.  This is ascribed to a variety of different
causes.  At that time, it was considered as disgraceful to re-
ceive supply from the session; and none but such as were in
the most distressed circumstances ever thought of making
application to it.  By this they were led to make every ex-
ertion for their own support; and their children, from the
same principle, acquired early habits of industry.
   The country was then parcelled out in small farms, and
employed a greater number of hands in the cultivation of it.
Their incomes, though small, afforded them in general, the
certain means of subsistence.  Few ever thought of resorting
to towns, but such as could live upon their money, or upon
the profits of their particular callings.  When the farms were
enlarged, as they now are, these cottagers or small tenants
crowded into towns or neighbouring villages; and being
bred to no business, they soon exhausted their little stock,
and became burdens upon the public.  The consequence of
the suppression of cottagers is felt, and will be more and
more felt in many different ways throughout Scotland.
   The funds chiefly arise from the interest of a small stock of
money, and a mortification of some lands, public collections,
proclamation of banns, baptisms, legacies, mort-cloths, seat
rents, etc.  The most necessitous of the poor are supplied
by weekly pensions, which are from 6 d. to 2 s. 6 d. per week;
and such as need occasional supply to assist their own indus-
try, by precepts and watering rolls.  Precepts are distribu-
tions made by the sessions as occasion requires.  Watering
rolls are the distributions which are made at each Sacrament,
which is twice every year.-Bailie Gray of this place some
