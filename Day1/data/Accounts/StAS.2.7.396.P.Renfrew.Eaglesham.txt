sents little now to the eye of the spectator, except a few smooth,
knolls of rubbish, and of the obvious inequalities occasioned by
the sites of the old foundations, covered entirely with a thick
sward of short matted grass.  If the estimates of the genealogists
may be depended on, upwards of five hundred successions of the
seasons have worn down this once famots and venerated pile to
its present curtailed and almost imperceptible dimensions, or almost
total obliteration from the face of nature, but not from the
recorded pages of the historian and antiquary.  The spot is still
rich in classical recollections, and the chivalrous associations and
exploits of former ages.  We can scarcely look on the dreary region
where this ancient fortalice once stood, the terror and stern
protection of the district, without recollecting the Stewarts of
Scotland, the Montgomeries, Otterburn, Hotspur, and Chevy
Chace, where one of its most adventurous lords fell by the too unerring
and blood-thirsty shaft of a southern archer.  The Castle of
Polnoon has now nothing left to record its ancient fame but the
recollections of the past ; otherwise it has nothing to recommend
it to the attention of the stranger.  The illiterate now despise or
overlook it.
                         III.-POPULATION.
   The return of the population made to Dr Webster in 1755 was
1103.  In 1791, the number was only 1,000, of whom about 300
were under six years of age, and 700 six years old and upwards.
At that period, the baptisms were on an average, 25 per annum,
and the marriages, 9 or 10. In 1801, the population was 1176 ;
in 1811, ten years after, 1424; and in 1821 it had increased to
1927, of whom 932 were males, and 995 fem`les.  There were
then 239 houses in the parish, which leaves about eight individuals
to each house.  In 1831, the population amounted to 2372, which
is chiefly to be attributed to the cotton-works erected in the village
and at Millhall.  It is supposed that at next census there will be
a decrease of inhabitants or, at least, that they will not have in-
creased much since 1831. The results of the several Government
returns is as follows:-
