                                  ARBROATH.                              77

        Panmure, have of late been intrusted to the care of the magistrates,
and are preserved among the existing records of the town. Amongst
the documents in the possession of the kirk-session is a roll, beau-
tifully written on parchment, dated 1445, exhibiting a statement
of the dues payable from several crofts in the town and its immediate
vicinity, for upholding lights in the Lady Chapel, which appears
to have stood near to the present harbour. In this document the
following streets and crofts are enumerated, viz. Neugate, Seygate,
Neumarcatgate, Marcatgate, Grymysby, Mylgate, Lortburngate,
Appylgate, Ratonraw, and Cobgate. These are all now built upon
as streets, with the exception of Newgate, which is only partially
occupied with houses.  Grimsby was built upon during the latter
part of the last century. To what extent the other places men-
tioned in the roll were built upon in the fifteenth century, we have
no means of determining. In ancient times, Cobgate was the name
given to that part of the High Street which is below, and Raton-
raw to that part of it which is above, the present parish church.
          Eminent Characters.--We are not aware of any distinguished
warrior, statesman, or author, connected with the parish, either by
birth or residence. It is the burial-place, however, of one of the
kings of Scotland; William the Lion having been interred in the
Abbey, which be founded.
          Land-owners.--The superiority of the property is vested in the
corporation of Arbroath.
          Parochial Registers.--These consist of the kirk-session minutes,
whose earliest date is 1669 ; and of the records of births and bap-
tisms, and of marriage-contracts and marriages, which commence
in 1659. They are in general in a good state of preservation.
The entries of marriages are defective in 1659, 1661, 1696, 1697,
1698, and 1700; and of births and baptisms in 1660, 1661, 1696,
1697, 1698, 1699, and 1700; and the volume or volumes contain-
ing both, from 1735 to 1748 inclusive, have been lost. There is
no record of the proceedings of the kirk-session from 1684 to 1732,
nor from 1735 to 1748.
           Antiquities.--Under the head of antiquities Arbroath has been
long celebrated for the ruins of its abbey. This edifice was
founded by King William the Lion in 1178, and dedicated to the
memory of Thomas a Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. The
precincts of the abbey were inclosed with a stone wall from 20 to
24 feet in height; and formed an area 1150 feet in length from
