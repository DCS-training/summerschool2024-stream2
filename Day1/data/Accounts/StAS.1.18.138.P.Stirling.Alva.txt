Virgin Mary, to St. Servanus, and to the church of St. Ser-
vanus de Alveth, describing it particularly as lying near the
well of St. Servanus, "et inter ipfum fontem et ecclesiam."
This charter is dated, A. D. 1276.  This well is still within the
limits of the minister's glebe, and although its consecrated name
has been long forgotten, it continues to send forth a copious
firearm of the purest and sweetest water.  About 20 years af-

expence; and, without any enlargement of the area, might be
