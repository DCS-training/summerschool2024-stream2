	These works are all in the neighbourhood of Glasgow excepting
five, and none of them are thirty miles distant from that city. Pre-
viously to,the use, of Neilson's hot-blast, 6000 tons of iron were
made at Clyde Iron-Works in a year. In the formation of each
ton of iron, eight tons of coal, and fifteen cwt. of limestone were
required. In 1833, when the hot-blast was applied, the same
steam-engine made 12,500 tons of iron, each ton requiring only
three tons of coal, and eight cwt. of limestone. The whole of the
above ironworks are using the hot-blast in all their furnaces, ex-
cepting the Carron Company, who have only yet taken out a license
for one of their furnaces. The license is at the rate of 1s. per ton.
The best coal for making iron at the above works does not ave-
rage above 4s. per ton.
	Supply of Coals in Glasgow.--In 1831, Dr Cleland ascertained
from coal-masters and authentic documents, that the supply of coals
came from thirty-seven coal pits; that the quantity brought to
Glasgow was 561,049 tons, and of that quantity 124,000 were ex-
ported, thereby leaving 437,049 tons for the use of families, and
public works, in the city and suburbs. The additional consump-
tion since the above statement was made, may be fairly estimated at
ten per cent. on the home consumption, and five per cent. on the ex-
port, which makes the quantity brought to Glasgow in 1835 amount
to 610,953 tons. The following is the average prices of coals de-
livered in quantities in Glasgow, during a period of eight years.

	In 1821,             8s.	4d. to 9s.   4d. per ton.
           1822,	     7s.       11d. to 8s.  11d.
           1823,	     7s.	6d. to Ss.   6d.

           1828,	     5s.       10d. to 6s.  10d.

	There has been no variation in the price of coals from 1828 to
1835. The best hard splint is laid down at the steam-boat quay
at 6s. 3d. per ton.
	In 1835, Cannel coal from Lesmahagow, for the formation of gas,
is laid down at the gas works at 16s. per ton; ditto from pits in
the neighbourhood of Glasgow, 10s. 6d. per ton; average on the
quantity used, 14s. per ton.
	The manufacture of flint-glass or crystal was introduced here
by Messrs Cookson and Company of Newcastle in 1777, and is now
carried on to_a very considerable extent. Soon after that period,
a number of chemical works were erected in the neighbourhood of
this city. The Chamber of Commerce and Manufactures was in-
