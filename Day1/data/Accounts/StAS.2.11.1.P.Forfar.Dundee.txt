		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HHSTORY.
	Name, Boundaries, &c.--DUNDEE, a large manufacturing town
and parish, is situate on the northern bank of the river Tay, about
sixty miles from its source, and twelve from the open sea. The
name was anciently written Dunde or Dundie. Some regard it
as a contracted form of Dei Donum, which is the designation of
the town in law Latin. There can be no doubt, however, that
the word is Celtic, and was originally either Dunde or Duntaw,
(in Latin Taodunum;) the former signifying the Hill of God, the
latter the Hill of Tay,--both probably in allusion to an insulat-
ed conical hill immediately bebind the town, which rises to the
height of about 525 feet above the level of the river, and which
would in all probability be the first object to receive a name from
our Celtic forefathers.
	The parish extends along the river about six miles. At its west-
ern branch it is about two miles broad, but it gradually narrows
towards its eastern limits, at which it strikes off from the river at
right angles, so as to extend above five miles in a northerly direc-
tion. The Tay forms the boundary of the parish on the south;
