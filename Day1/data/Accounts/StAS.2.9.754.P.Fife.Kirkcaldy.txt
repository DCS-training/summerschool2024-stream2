or establishments.  Besides these, there are a few individuals who
occasionally make webs.  The. manufacturers employ 1100 weav-
ers.  Of this number 113 work in two factories, erected for the
manufacture of canvas.  This branch of trade was introduced in
1811; and the manufacturers of sail-cloth here generally obtain
a share, of government contracts for the navy.  Only 119 weav-
ers, exclusive of the factory workmen, are accommodated with
looms within the parish.  Accordingly, many weavers in the ad-
joining parishes and surrounding villages, are employed by the
manufacturers of Kirkcaldy.  The average earning Of weavers is
6s. 6d. per week; and the price of weaving is from one-fifth to
two-ninths of the value of the goods when they are ready for the
market.  The gross value of the linens allnually manufactured
within the burgh may be estimated at L.80,000.  Of the whole
manufactures in the town, in the extended sense already explain-
ed, including the Links and Pathhead, two-fifths are said to be
produced within the burgh; so that the value of the various de-

filcilities for ascertaining the number of weavers employed on an average of years; the
weekly wages of weavers, and the proportion which expense of weaving bears to the
cost of the goods.
         Out of this sum the weaver has to pay the winding of his weft, and all other ex-
penses.  A very inadequate pittance is left for his subsistence.

                      Reports from Assistant Commissions Hand-L Weavers.
   Since the date of this report weavers' wages have been reduced 10 per cent..
This proportion has been ascertained by taking from the books of two manufac-
turers a number of webs given out to different weavers in succession, and may there-
fore be regarded as a fair average of their business.  The gross value of the one num-
ber, which are all ticks, is L.148, 6d.; the price of weaving, L.43 6s. 6d.  The
value of the other number, composed of ticking and dowlas, is L.123, 19s. 6 1/2d.; the
price of weaying, L.29, 13s. 8 1/2d.  The expense of weaving fine ticks is nearly one-
third of their cost; sheetings, one-fourth; dowlas, one-fifth; coarser fabrics, one-
sixth; and the best sail-cloth, one-eighth.  Nothing is here allowed for the manu-
facturer's profit.
