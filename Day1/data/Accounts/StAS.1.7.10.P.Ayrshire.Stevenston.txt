   The improvement of districts, and even of countries and
kingdoms, seems to depend, not so much upon a natural and
regular tendency in the progress of society towards improve-

by Providence from time to time, endued with uncommon
talents themselves, and capable of routing the talents, stimu-

Of this sort was a Robert Cunningham of Auchinharvie,
who, by the death of his uncle Sir Robert Cunningham,
physician to Charles II. became proprietor of this whole pa-
