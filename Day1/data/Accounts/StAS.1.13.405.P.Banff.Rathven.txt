this line; but the want of a harbour to ship the fish regu-
larly to market, and the high price of salt, rendered them
unsuccessful.  Were a proper quay built, and salt free from
duty allowed for curing cod, the above being the best sea-
son, a large supply of excellent cod might be sent regularly
to market.  The cod caught at this season,after lying as
long as necessary in the salt, are generally dried for a few
days, and even the winter season, after salting, will dry
them sufficiently.  The best markets in Scotland for salt
cod, are Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leith, Borrowstounness,
and all the coast-towns on the frith of Forth.  The prin-
cipal market for pickled or barrelled cod is London.

   Lobster-Fishery.-In 1792, all the fishers on the coast en-
tered into a contract for 5 years with Messrs.  Selby and 
Company of London, or with the Northumberland Fishery 
Society, to fish for lobsters, when they did not find it pru-
dent to go in search of other fish.  The skiff and tackling
for this fishery cost about L. 5, 5 s.  The Companies fur-
nish the skiffs, and are reimbursed by instalments.
They take all their lobsters at 2 1/2 d. a-piece, provided they mea-
sure 6 inches from the point of the nose to the end of the 
boss, and when under that size, two are esteemed equivalent
to one.  Lobsters are in season from 1st February to the
end of June, and from 1st November to Christmas.  Last
year lobsters to a  considerable value were caught on this
coast; but less attention has been paid to them this year,
owing partly to the great success of the white fishery, and
partly to the amazing quantity of lobsters caught on the
coast of Caithness, which the Companies have at a cheaper
rate, viz. at 1 1/2 d. for the largest size.  I am unable to state
the product of this fishery for the last year in all the 4 towns,
by reason of the removal of some of the Companies agents,
