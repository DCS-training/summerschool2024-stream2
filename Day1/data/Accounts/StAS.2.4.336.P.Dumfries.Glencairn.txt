parish, since the former Statistical Account was written, consist
principally in the improvement of the houses belonging to the pro-
prietors,--the superior accommodation afforded to the tenants,--the
improved mode of cultivation,--and the excellent state of the roads.
The villages of Minnyhive and Dunreggan have also been greatly
enlarged, and the houses which have been built are of a superior
description. The distance from coal and water carriage will for
ever prevent the possibility of this parish becoming a manufactur-
ing district of any importance.
