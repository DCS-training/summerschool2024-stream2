	Mansion-Houses.--The mansion-houses in this parish are three;
1st, Cairnhill, which consists of two parts separated by an area
or small space between. The oldest part is a tower that has
already stood the storms of several centuries, and is still in good
repair and habitable, and, like other ancient edifices, has been
strongly built.  The other part is comparatively modern. 2d,
Barnweill is a neat house, built about half a century ago. 3d,
Underwood is also a commodious house, built about fifty years
ago, and now occupied by the proprietor and family.
	Only two of the heritors at present reside in the parish.
	Antiquities.--Craigie Castle, a very ancient building, was at one
time the residence of the Wallaces of Cmigie, but is now in a
state of dilapidation. The castle has been surrounded with a
moat enclosing about four acres of land; and the entrance into it
was at the south-west side by a drawbridge.
	There still exist some artificial mounds, (named law-hills) on
which, in former times persons guilty of crimes, real or supposed
are said to have been tried; but some of them appear to have
been military encampments, especially the one on Barriweill hill,
and another near Campcastle.
