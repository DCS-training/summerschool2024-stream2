     Statistical Account

Borthwick itself stands in a pleasant valley, surrounded on
every side by rising grounds of considerable height, but
searce so high, or of such rapid ascent, as to deserve the
name of hills.  The general surface is uneven, and when
viewed from the church, very much resembles the waves

and ditch, and partly by stone and lime walls, has been of
great service; and the strips and clumps of plantation, which
meet the eye in every direction, have beautified the coun-
try, and tend very much to warm and fertilize the soil.
The rotation of crops, like the soil, must be various, but
the introduction of green crops and summer fallow, have
been of unspeakable advantage, both in cleaning the ground
and in procuring plenty of nourishing food for black cattle
and horses, and consequently in increasing the quantity of
manure.  There is in every corner plenty of lime, which in
this part of the country is not now much used as manure,

sufficient estimation, or what is more probable, because a
