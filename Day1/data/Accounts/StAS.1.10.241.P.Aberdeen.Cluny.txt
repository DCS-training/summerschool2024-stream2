   Seed Time, etc.-Oats are sown here usually from the
middle or end of March, and bear is sown and potatoes plant-
ed from that time to the beginning or middle of May, ac-
cording to the season.  Harvest begins commonly about the
20th or towards the end of August, and is finished in the
beginning or at farthest the middle of October, unless the
season be very unfavourable.  In the year 1782, so fatal to the
kingdom, oats were cut out of snow and ice, in the beginning
and even the middle of November; but having been full be-
fore the storm came on, they were thought to ripen even un-
der the snow, nor was it the frost that hurt the crop, and
brought the meal to 1 s. 6 d. a peck, but the want of wind
to dry it, in consequence of which it turned hot, and rotted
in the corn yards.  The usual produce from the old mode of
agriculture, at an average, is three or at most four returns,
whereas by the new husbandry, the returns are from ten to
twelve, and sometimes more.  The product of the district is
considerably more than its consumption and surplus is
carried to Aberdeen, where there is a ready vent for it.
Great part of the rents, sometimes a half or more, are paid in
bear and meal, which the tenants are obliged, when requir-
ed, to carry at their own expence to Aberdeen, or any place
of the like distance.  Some years ago services of all kinds,
called bondage, were exacted from the tenants; but they are
now mostly converted into money, to their great accommo-
dation and advantage.  No leaves are granted for more than
19 years, and many for a much shorter period.  There is no
village in the parish; the farmers and their subtenants, when
they have any, live together upon their separate and respec-
tive farms, the rents of which are from 10 L. to 40 L.  The
subtenants, by way of security, sometimes pay the rent before
hand, and of course have no rent to pay the year of their re-
moval.  They seldom require or get a written leave from
