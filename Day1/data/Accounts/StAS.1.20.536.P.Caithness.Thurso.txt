     Statistical Account

   3. It is well known, that the northern parts of Scotland,
were formerly inhabited by the Pictish tribes, and many
constructions of a singular nature, known under the name of
Picts Houses, are scattered over the county of Caithness.  In
the course of carrying on his improvements, the author was
led, several years ago, to examine one of these buildings,
and he drew up, at the time, the following hints, respecting
their nature and construction.
   The foundation of the house was laid with clay, but they
seem to have been totally unacquainted with the use of lime
as a cement; nor was even clay itself made use of in the
upper part of the building.
   Many of the stones were of an enormous size, and evi-
dently brought from the shore, though the distance is not in-
considerable.  They could neither be carried there, nor af-
terwards made use of, without great strength, or ingenious
mechancial inventions.
   Some earthen ware was discovered, very rudely manu-
factured, a sufficient proof at how low an ebb the arts were
in the Pictish nations.
   A few small copper coins were found in the ruins, but
much defaced, and the letters engraved illegible.
   From the number of horns and shells found in the house,
it is probable that the principal food of the inhabitants con-
sisted of venison, and the shell-fish called limpets.  The bones
of cattle were also discovered, which proves that pasturage
was not wholly unknown.
   The Picts seem to have been acquainted with the use of
iron, for a knife was found calculated for taking the lim-
pets off the rocks, and such as is in use to this day.
   Some singular articles made of bone were discovered, the
nails by which they were fixed were of bone also, but the
use of them is unknown.
