count of that parish, which, although we have had no op-
portunity of seeing, we are no strangers to his abilities.
   The mound of earth near the foot of the town of Mid-
Calder, now called the Cunnigar, and upon which, it is
said, many of the poor unhappy people called the witches
of Calder were burnt; from its peculiar situation, perfect
symmetry, and excavation of the earth on the south-west
side, now almost imperceptible, it is unquestionably artifi-
cial; and there seems to be as little doubt, that it was erect-
ed for the purpose of holding provincial meetings of the
Bards and Druids, who held all their meetings, civil or re-
ligious, in the open air, and upon mounds of earth natural
or artificial.  This conjecture, if not proved, is at least
strongly fortified, when we are informed, that, in the Celtic
language, the word Cadair signifies a meeting of this kind*;
the word Calder, the name of this place and parish, is but a
small deviation from the other, and is certainly derived
from it.
   The same authority informs us, that the person who offi-
ciated as crier or reciter at these provincial assemblies was
called the Dadgeiniad, hence perhaps Dadrige, the name
of a place in the near neighbourhood, which might have
been the residence of this Druidical officer.  These people
were heathens; but we are not told that they ever defiled
their temples with human sacrifices to their superstition, va-
nity, or malevolence.

   Popular Song.-It may also be expected that something
should be said of the Bonny Lass of Livingstone, so famed in
song; but although this ballad, and the air to which it is
sung, seem to have as little claim to antiquity as they have
