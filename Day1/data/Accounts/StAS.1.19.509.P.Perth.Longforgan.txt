from corner to corner of the field, with other drains, leading
either through, or from every spouty part of the field, thus,

three feet deep and two feet broad,
(narrower may do if the stones be
scarce), and the whole should be left open till it should be
seen whether those made are sufficient to drain off the water
from all the spouty parts of the field.
   The next thing to be attended to, is to take care that
the bottom of the ditch be lower than any vein of sand
which touches it, or which communicates with it; other-
wise the drain will be of no use; as the sandy veins will
conduct the water wherever they reach, which will burst
out at the first obstruction.  Satisfied in these particulars,
the ditches may be filled, from one foot to 18 inches as the
quantity of water may require, with small stones, broken
on purpose, and laid in as irregularly as possible.  Over
