been dug up, and discovered the bones of those antient war-
riors over whom, they had been raised.
   With respect to the hills above mentioned, it may be ob-
served, that they are peculiarly adapted for sheep ; being
verdant the greatest part of the year.  The proprietors turn
them to good account, by the rearing and feeding of black cat-
tle; doubtless, turning them into sheep walks, would render
them full more beneficial to themselves, and useful to the
country.  The Bin mostly belongs to Roger Ayton, Esq. of
Inch-dairny; Dunearn to Dr Charles Stuart of Edinburgh;
Orrock to the Earl of Morton; and Babie to William Fergu-
son, Esq. of Raith.

   Soil.  Between the hills and the sea, the soil is mostly
very rich, and when properly cultivated, produces excellent
crops.  The rent is generally from 4 to 4 1/2 bolls of barley,
or from L. 3 to L. 3 : 3 an acre.  Wheat, barley, and beans,
are most cultivated.  The grain is of the best quality, from
the warmness of the climate, owing to the surrounding hills.
The grounds, in the higher part of thr parish, are of a much
inferior value, as may be supposed, from the lightness of the
soil, and their more elevated situation : Notwithstanding
which, they bring a good rent to the proprietor.  Few of the
tenants have regular tacks, and extensive farms.  They, in
general, follow the new mode of farming.  The burdensome
and injurious effects, of the feudal, system are totally abolished
among them.

   Ecclesiaslical State of the Parish.  The place of worship
for the parish, was formerly, about half a mile north of the
town.  The remains of it are still to be seen, with the old manse,
and burial yard.  It evidently appears to have been originally a
Popish chapel, but when built, is not known.
