ship was seized upon the coast by Roderick Macniel, then 
Laird of Barray, surnamed Ruary'n tarter, or Rory the 
turbulent, probably so called, frm the frequent depreda-
tions he committed in different places, which were not un-
common in those days. Queen Elizabeth complained to 
the Court of Scotland of this act of piracy committed up-
on her subjects; upon which, the Laird of Barray was 
summoned to appear at Edinburgh, to answer for his un-
justisiable behavior; but he either refused or despised the 
summons.  Several attempts were made afterward to ap-
prehend him, which proved unsuccesful. Mr Mackenzie, 
commonly called the tutor of Kintail, predecessor to the late
Lord Macleod, Undertook to effect by stratagem, what o-
thers could not do by more direct means.  Having come, 
under cover of a friendly visit, to the castle of Kisimul,
where the Laird then resided, he invited him and all his 
retainers on board, who not suspecting any hostile design,
suffered themselves to be overpowered with excess of li-
quor, so that all his friends were easily persuaded to go on 
shore, and trust their chief in the hands of one who had so
hospitably entertained them*.

for emigration, but repented time enough to avoid the snare into which
their friends have been inconsiderately led by going to America; they
also sold their effects, and spent the money arising from the conversion,
so that they would have been destitute in their native country; but Mr 
Macneil, the proprietor not only gave them, and such as returned from 
Glasgow, lands, but likewise money enough to purchase a new stock of 
cattle, and all the other necessary implements of husbandry.  The spirit 
for emigration is now happily and totally suppressed.
