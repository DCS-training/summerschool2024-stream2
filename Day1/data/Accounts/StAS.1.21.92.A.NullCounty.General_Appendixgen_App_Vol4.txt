   Muir-burning.-The sportsman exclaims, nay, thunders out
execrations and anathemas against the shepherd as an enemy
to game.  Burning of heath is in some degree a science,
executed partially, with consideration and caution; seldom
done but from the 1st of October to the month of March,
and at no time until the heath begins to decay.  The benefit
of it to sheep is immense, in point of feeding and medicine.
To the game, especially grouse, it is luxury.  The heather
bells from the young growth, pregnant with honey, the va-
riety of mountain berries, and the richness of verdure, which
continues for several years until the heath becomes rank and
begins to decay, afford a plentiful subsistence to the game.
Could the feathered tribe articulate, they would bless the
hand which was the mean of so plentiful a store.  In effect,
in hoarse and sonorous notes they do so.-The idea that
heath, if never burned, would in time decay and be eradi-
cated, scarcely deserves a reply.

   Turnip and Potatoes.-The culture of turnip has in most
countries been carried to perfection; that of potatoes, of late
years, has made great progress, but, in point of feeding cat-
tle, not so universally attended to.  Turnips are dangerous
to cows before calving, and many suffer thereby; but they
improve even by a few handfuls of potatoes a-day, and no
quantity will injure them.  Beef fed upon turnips is far in-
ferior in quality to that upon potatoes; three bolls of which,
with straw or hay, and a sheaf of corn each a day, for the
last two or three weeks, will completely feed an ox of an or-
dinary size.  Peat and turf ashes, if kept dry, and laid in
drills, so as to go a greater length, will yield excellent tur-
nips, and feeding cattle upon the field will sufficiently ma-
nure it.  Thus the manure commonly used for turnips may
be allotted for potatoes; no matter how rich for such as are
