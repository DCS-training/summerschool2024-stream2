   Schools.-There are three schools in the parish.  A pa-
rochial school near the church, in which 60 children are
usually taught.  The schoolmaster's salary is 200 merks
Scots; but his income, including his appointments of ses-

girls spinning, sewing, and knitting stockings.  In both,
there are above 60 boys and girls generally taught.

from the shore.  It may, however, at some future time,
