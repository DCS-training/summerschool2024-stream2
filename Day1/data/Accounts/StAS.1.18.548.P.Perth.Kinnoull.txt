were deserted, probably from the want of a proper fund to ren-
der them effectual.  The whole expence of the bridge, was
L. 26,446: 12: 3.
   Before the new bridge was built, Bridge end was a poor
paltry village, consisting of a few houses, chiefly for the ac-
commodation of the boatmen and their families.  The houses
were low built, ill-lighted, and covered with straw-thatch;
but of late, a better style of building has prevailed, and a
great addition has been made to the village.  Within the last
7 years, no less than 31 new houses have been built, which
are commodious and well lighted; which will cherish a spirit
of cleanliness, and contribute materially to the health of the
inhabitants.  Some of the houses lately built, are rented at
L. 50, and none of them below L. 9 or L. 10 per annum.  There
are 98 houses in the village, and the buildings are still going
on; and perhaps the time is not far distant, when Bridge-end
will be an extensive, populous, and respectable village.  Some
gentlemen of considerable landed property reside in it; and
were some spirited manufacturers established there, they
would have the best opportunity of purchasing linen yarn and
cloth, going to market, from the Carse of Gowrie, Coupar of
Angus, and the Stormount, as the turnpike roads from these
districts, all meet in Bridge-end.  The Earl of Kinnoul, is
superior of the whole village; and by his Lordship's charter,
for the baronies of Kinnoul and Pitcullen, he is entitled "to
"hold a weekly market every Thursday, and 4 free fairs in
"the year; 1 on the 15th of May; the 2 d on the 12th of
"June; the 3 d on the 5th of July; and the last on the 7th of
"October.  By said charter, also the village of Bridge-end,
"is to be called the burgh of Kinnoul: and the fairs to be
"held there, or in any other town or place within the rega-
"lity; with power to erect and build, free sea-ports, harbours,
"and shores, for receiving ships, boats, and other vessels,
