     of Yester.

est part of the parish has been brought into very good order.
Some of the best ground is near the foot of Lammer-moor
hills; the most of the arable land is rather a shallow than a
deep soil.  The air is pure and very healthy; and no parti-
cular distemper is prevalent in the parish; though it has been
observed that, of late years, consumptions have been more fre-
quent than usual in this part of the country.

   Natural Productions.-The hill ground is about two miles
square, and the number of acres of arable land is about 4000,
of which near 2000 acres are employed in raising corn and
roots, and in fallow.  There are sown about 200 bolls of
wheat, 1100 bolls of oats, 200 bolls of barley, 180 bolls of
pease, 120 acres of turnips, 100 acres of potatoes, from 15 to
20 acres of flax; but this last is not much cultivated here, the
ground not being fit for it.  There are often 180 acres of fal-
low, which is sown down with wheat and barley.  Much more
grain is raised than the people can consume:  Much is sold in
Haddington market; and a considerable quantity goes yearly
to the west country.  More than one-half of the ground in the
parish is in pasture and sown grass; about 200 acres are cover-
ed with wood, such as elm, oak, beech, and fir; among which
are some of the largest and most beautiful trees in Scotland.
One oak-tree in the wood of Yester was valued some years ago
at L. 25.  A good number of sheep, and, of the late years, a num-
ber of calves are bred in the parish.  Some tenants rear in 
one year about 20 calves each.  There may be, of faddle and 
work-horses, about 200, black cattle about 600, and 140 score
of sheep.  The usual time of sowing is the beginning of March,
and of reaping the beginning of September.
