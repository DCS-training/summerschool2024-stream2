     Of Bellie.

   There are in the parish upwards of 1000 black cattle,
mostly of the common country breed, many of which are
sent away in the summer to graze, pasture grass being
scarce upon the coast.  We have about 340 horses, many
of them rather small sized, and something above 2200
sheep, generally a mixture of the Linton breed.  Gordon
castle will readily be supposed an exception to all these,
where the cattle, horses and sheep are large.  Many
plough with a pair of horses.  Indeed, it is the most
frequent practice, the ground being light and easily ma-
naged:  Some put a yoke or two of black cattle behind
them.  There are but few ploughs, comparatively,
drawn by oxen entirely.  A cart among the country
people may generally be reckoned for every horse:
Carts drawn otherwise, are not many in comparison.

   Manufactures and Fisheries.-One manufacturer of
some eminence, has long resided on the burn of Focha-
bers, and manages very considerable business in weaving
stockings of cotton, thread, and worsted, and some pieces
for waistcoats and breeches.  He also deals a little in the
thread trade.  Another, who is also a merchant, carries
on a manufacture of lint, thread and tobacco, to some
amount.  There is a capital salmon fishery here upon the
Spey, chiefly the property of the Duke of Gordon, from
which his grace derives a rent of 1500 L. a-year, from
Messrs. Gordon and Richardson.  It extends from Spey-
mouth about 5 miles, and terminates in a complete row
of cruives across the river.  There is a large lofty edifice
near the sea for the gentlemen that hold the lease.
There are buildings for the overseers, coopers, etc.,
and that furnish every accommodation for the fishery.
They have got a very good ice-house.  An hundred and
