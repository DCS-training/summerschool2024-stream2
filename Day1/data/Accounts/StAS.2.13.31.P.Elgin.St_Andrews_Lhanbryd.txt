   a ton weight of blue argillaceous limestone, having its mass confus-
   edly mingled with a variety of petrified shells, in which the Cornu
   ammonis was conspicuous, and muscle shells bore the largest pro-
   portion.  If this boulder had ever been detached from the rock
   of the same material at Brora, its transportation to its long undis-
   turbed bed here, not three feet under the surface of the globe, is much
   more difficult to be accounted for, than that of the celebrated dwel-
   ling transported entire from the eastern shore of the Mediterra-
   nean Sea, to the western coast of the Adriatic.

     Antiquities. - This parish had the credit of having preserved two
   Druidical monuments through all the mutations of nearly 3000
   years, until lately when, for the sorry purpose of forming material
   for a road, and uniting a little spot of pasturage to a corn field, one
   of these objects was annihilated. The other, at the distance
   scarcely of a mile, is nearly entire.

                                   IV.-INDUSTRY.
     Agriculture.-This parish is now, with little exception, occupi-
   ed in farms of from 100 to about 400 or 500 acres, and by gentle-
   men of skill with adequate capital.

<TABLE>
           The number of acres in cultivation is probably about       4000
                               never cultivated, (cannot be stated.)

     The rental of the parish is betwixt L.3000 and L. 4000.
     Manufactures.-In this parish there is one public manufacture
   of malt.  Mr Brown carries on the business of a distiller at Link-
   wood, having invested a large capital in the requisite buildings
   and utensils, all in the most commodious arrangement, and of the
   most substantial construction, in the malting, grinding, brewing,
   distilling, and in the store. The stills are respectively of the con-
   tents of 400 and of 170 gallons, manufacturing yearly 1200 quar-
   ters of barley, kind producing from 16,000 to 20,000 gallons of
   fine spirit, cousumed mainly between the rivers Spey and Ness;
   a small proportion only being disposed of iw London, and in some
   of the, larger cities of this kingdom; the, rivalry in brandy, rum,
   and gin, being inconsiderable.  But a formidable competition is
   maintained by the great distilleries in the south of Scotland, which
