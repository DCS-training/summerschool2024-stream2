has long been another light-house on the Irish side, it ren-
ders the passage, even in the darkest night, convenient and
comfortable, like a street well lighted on both sides.  The
sea rises considerably along this coast.  At low water you can
walk round the point of the pier, which at high water is
from ten to fifteen feet deep at the entrance.  This being
the narrowest part of the Channel, has naturally the effect
of accumulating the fluid upon the shores, when there is
a swell from a storm.  What is farther deserving of re-
mark is, that at Donaghadee, which is almost directly op-
posite, the sea ebbs and flows near an hour sooner than at
Portpatrick.  There are also (which is still more remark-
able) some particular parts of the coast, well known to
our seamen, more especially one about two miles from the
shore of Portpatrick, where the same fact is observed.  Within
three or four miles of the Irish shore, when the flood re-
turns, there is a regular current which sets off strongly for
the Mull of Galloway.  It runs at the rate of seven knots
an hour, and is so forcible, that when the wind opposes it, it
exhibits, for a great way, the appearance of breakers.  It is
called the Race of Strangers, and is a very curious spectacle.

   The Packet Boats to Ireland.-The mode of conveying the
mail between the two kingdoms has undergone many changes.
At first regular packet boats, with salaries, were established.
But before the quay was built, and, while the passage
was attended with the difficulties above described, delays
were frequent.  The sailors, especially as their wages at
all events were running on, often chose to rest themselves.
Established packets were therefore abolished, and a rule fixed,
