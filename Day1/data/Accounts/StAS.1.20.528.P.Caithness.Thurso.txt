   SECT. IV.  Supply of Fuel.-The fuel most generally used
in Thurso is peat and turf; but, of late years, coal has become
the favourite fire with the better sort of people, and every
year increases the importation of coals to Thurso; and though
notwithstanding the exemption from duty, it still sells as
high, nay, higher than when the duty was paid, yet such
is the advanced price of peats, that such of the inhabitants
as use coal, find it the cheaper firing of the two; and in all
probability, a few years more, will bring coals into general
use in rown.  It should seem strange, that the taking off the
duty on coals, reckoned so heavy a grievance to the nor-
thern pars of Scotland, should afford the consumer no ac-
tual relief in the price of the commodity.  But such is the
case, at least in Caithness, where, in fact, the price of
both English and Scotch coals are higher than when the
duty was exacted.  The merchant pleads the advance of
freight and seamens wages, in consequence of the war, and
the time which vessels sent to load coals in the Frith of
Forth, must lie at the works, before they can get their car-
goes, owing to the additional demand.  But allowing to
both these considerations their due weight, yet still 16 s. or
17 s. per ton for Scotch coals, and 20 s. or 21 s. per ton for
English coals, is certainly too high a price.

   SECT. V.  Prices of Labour.-As the prices of provi-
sions have advanced, so have the prices of labour likewise.
The present rate of wages to tradesmen and labourers, is as
follows:
