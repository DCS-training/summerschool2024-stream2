or feeding cattle or sheep, and producing milk and fine but-
ter.  A cow's grass cannot be got in these inclosures under
L. 3; and they are let at more than L. 2 per acre for summer
pasture.  There are 4 heritors, one of whom resides.

   Population.-The relation to Dr Webster in 1755 was 497
souls; the present number of inhabitants is between 300
and 400; the diminution being owing to the letting large farms,
and casting down two villages.  For 4 years preceding 1792,
the births were 44, the deaths 13, and the marriages 9.  There
are 8 farmers, 2 smiths, 4 wrights, 2 weavers, and 3 masons
in the parish.

   Stipend, and Poor.-The stipend is L. 600 Scotch, 2 chal-
ders of barley, and 2 of oat meal, with a glebe of 6 acres.
The King is patron.  The number of poor on the roll is 6,
and the amount of the assessment for their support for the first
half year of 1792, is L 12: 12.

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-The stone in the parish is generally
blue whin stone, with one quarry of red free stone; on the
side of the water of Eden are two rocks commonly called the
Meikle and Little Thairn.-There is one take called Lurgie
Loch.-Dotterels appear in a little flock on the muirs for a few
weeks in June.-Both clay and shell marle are used here for
manure.-Coal is the common fuel, brought from England,
and from Lothian.  The price is about 1 s. per Cwt.-There
are in the north part of the parish 2 or 3 stones with large
seams, which it is said Mr Pocock when passing that way
thought to have been cemented together: but they have been
carried from the Lurgie craig, where are plenty of such stones.
When broken, they do not break at the seams.  They have
been dug up, but nothing was found under them.
