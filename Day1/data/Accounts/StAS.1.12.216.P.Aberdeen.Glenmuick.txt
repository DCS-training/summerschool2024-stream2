   Argiculture, etc.-The soil, in general, is hot and shallow, but
produces good grain, though proportionably little fodder.
Sowing begins about the middle or end of March, and reaping
about the middle or end of August, except in the upper parts
of the parishes, where the soil is cold and wet, and there seed-
time and harvest may be 2 or 3 weeks later.  The crops are
