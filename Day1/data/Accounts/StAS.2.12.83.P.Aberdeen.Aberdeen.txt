   A teacher attends in the prison dailv from 10 A. M. to 1 P. M.
and the chaplain visits five times in the week, exhorting, catechis-
ing, and praying with each prisoner separately.  The female pri-
soners, who are under the care of a female assistant to the jailer,
are also visited every lawful day, except Saturday, by the mem-
bers of the "Ladies' Association for promoting the Reformation of
Destitute Females."
   The diet of the prisoners is of the plainest kind, but wholesome
and in sufficient quantity; and the introduction of every kind of
luxury into the prison is strictly prohibited.
   Untried prisoners are permitted to be visited by their relatives
in the presence of the keeper of the prison, once a week, but after
conviction this liberty is allowed only once a month.
   The expense of maintaining the prisoners, and of keeping up
the necessary establishment, as well as the repairs of the building,
is defrayed out of the rogue money; the city and county bearing
each a share proportioned to the number of prisoners from each.
   The debtors are not subjected to the same restrictions as the
criminal prisoners, being permitted the free use of the yard and
day-room of their ward from 6 A. M. to 9 P. M. daily.
   The average number of prisoners during 1838 was about 57;
the greatest number at one time being 86, and the smallest, 39.
   The gross expenses (including salaries, repairs, &c.) of the es-
tablishment was, duridgtheyear 1836, L.670; 1837, L.611; 1838,
L.901. No sufficient return has been obtained of the number of com-
mitments, unless for the last year, when they were, males, 386; fe-
males, 124: total, 509.  By a return made for one year previous
to August 1338, it appears that there were in prison during that
period,
