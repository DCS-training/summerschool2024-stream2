fore those in the lower walks of life, that has excited in them,
(where properly encouraged), the like spirit of improvement,
by bringing lime at the same distance to their crofts, or small
pendicles, even when they have but one small horse and cart.
Such farmers, some of them men of enlarged ideas, are pub-
lic blessings.  Conscious of the inconvenience and hardships
they labour under, by the aforementioned services and customs,
they have let off part of their grounds to subtenants at a rea-
sonable rent, have built houses for them, given them leases,
and exact not one day's service from them; only when they
have occasion to hire them as day-labourers, that they shall

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Peats and turf have always
been the fuel used here, which, in digging, drying and carry-
ing home, employed the farmer and his servants the greatest
part of the summer, as the mosses are at the distance of 6 or 7
miles from many of the farms.  Now the more enlightened
farmers use no more peats than is necessary for their kitchens,
and drying their corns for meal, but choose rather to bring
English coal from Banff or M'Duff, though the price is ex-
travagantly high, sometimes 22 d. the barrel, of 12 stone
weight.  A few draughts of their carts will bring coal suffi-
cient to serve them through the year: and thus they have
time during the summer for carrying lime for their farms.
If the unequal and oppressive duty on coals carried coast-ways
were taken off, it would be the greatest advantage to this pa-
rish, (where the ordinary fuel is scarcely to be had, especial-
ly in wet: summers), as well as it would be to the whole of
the north of Scotland.  There are about 1500 black cattle in
the parish; 200 horses of various sizes; and 1600 sheep,
mostly of the small Scotch breed; they have been improving
in size and wool for some years, by the introduction of lar-
