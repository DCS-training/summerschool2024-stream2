easily, and therefore more cheaply, than he has been wont
to do.

   Manufactures.-The only manufacture in this county
worth mentioning, is that of knitting stockings, which has
been long established in Aberdeenshire*.  The country part
of the manufacture, is carried on entirely by women, to
whom the wool is delivered out by the Aberdeen stocking
merchants, who have fixed stations over the country, for giv-
ing out wool, receiving stockings, and reckoning with those
whom they employ.  The wool is almost all imported from
England, and none of the growth of the country is manufac-
tured; for which season, our wool is very inferior, and the
fleeces of a flock not worth more than 6 d. each, on an ave-
rage.  It is spun and worked into stockings, at a price pro-
portioned to their fineness or coarseness; and the average
gain of a good worker, will be 2 s. per week.  This manu-
facture has contributed to keep hands in the country; but it
admits of some doubt, whether these hands might not be
more profitably employed, and whether the manufacture has
promoted the interests of agriculture; but it certainly con-
tributes little to health, and conduces less to morality.

   Antiquities.-In this parish, the Marquis of Montrose, upon
the 2 d day of July 1645, won the battle of Alford, by de-
feating Baillie, one of the Generals of the Covenanters; but
his cause sustained an irreparable loss, in the death of the
Lord Gordon, the eldest son of the Marquis of Huntly, who

*According to the accounts of the Aberdeen merchants, (who export all
the stockings, either to Holland and the northern parts of Germany, from
whence they are often sent to America) the sum circulated through the
country in the neighbourhood of Aberdeen, merely for spinning the wool
and knitting the stockings, is from 70,000 L. to 90,000 L. per annum.  These
accounts are however in all probability, much beyond the truth.
