were superiors.  There exists a charter granted to Alexander
third Earl of Dunfermline in 1672 or 1673, reciting in the pre-
amble, that his father, and grandfather, and their predecessors, had
the privilege of keeping a weekly market on Thursday, and three
annual fairs on the lands of the manor-place of Fyvie, one on
Fastings-even, called Shrove-Tuesday; another on St Peter's day,
the first Tuesday of July; and the third on St Magdalene's day,
the last Tuesday of July;-Stating that Fyvie is at least twelve
miles distant from any royal burgh, and a convenient place for
trade and merchandize;-ratifying all previous gifts, and erecting
the Lordship of Fyvie into "ane free Burgh of Barony," to be
called the "Burgh of Barony of Fyvie," and granting power to
the said Earl and his heirs, to nominate and choose bailies and
magistrates for the government of the burgh;-to possess and use
"ane mercat cross;" and to admitmasons, baxters, brewers, skinners,
and all other craftsmen and artificers, to hold the above weekly
market and three annual fairs; and for punishing and imprisoning
malefactors and transgressors of the laws; to have and make a
"tolbuith" in the said town; and to call, accuse, and execute jus-
tice on all committers of murder, and theft, and other crimes,
within the said burgh limits; and annexing the said burgh of barony
of Fyvie to the lordship and barony of Fyvie in all time coming. *
The weekly market and annual fair on St Magdalene's day have
been long in desuetude, but the other two annual fairs are still re-
gularly held and well frequented, as will be afterwards noticed.

ancient seat of the family of Gight is now a ruin, but, with its sur-
rounding scenery, a very beautiful and picturesque one.  It stands
on the north bank of the Ythan, about four miles and a-balf east
of the parish church.  The valley of the river on both sides is
clothed with fine wood; on the north bank with natural wood of
every variety of foliage; while the associations connected with the
spot, as having belonged to the family of one who, during his short
career, shed around him such a bright display of genius and fancy,
(for himself and for the sake of mankind, it is to be deplored, so
unhappily directed,) give to it an additional interest.
   Fyvie Castle.-This extensive and venerable pile stands on the
north-east bank of the Ythan, within a fine park, with the sur-
rounding eminences on every side covered with beautiful and thriv-
ing wood.  It has been built at different periods, but the original
