it is drawn across the field, makes 3 drills at 18 inches dis-
tance, sows the feed and covers it.  By this means, my tur-
nips require little dexterity in hoeing them, and are never
smothered with earth.  If such a machine appears a desidera-
tum on small farms, I shall with pleasure send you a model
or drawing of it, with directions how to use it.
   The parochial schoolmaster here is Mr Robert Cormack.
He had his education at Marischal College; but never raised
his views higher than his present situation.  He is a most in-
dustious and successful teacher; labouring in his vocation
from Sunday to Sunday, and from morning to night.  He
has the merit of having established a Sunday school here as
far back as 1782.  Not fewer than 70, on an average, attend
regularly in the course of the day; young men before public
worship, and young women after it:  and this indefatigable
teacher attends them gratis from six o'clock in the morning
till late in the evening.  How inadequate is this man's salary,
although amongst the highest enjoyed by country school-
masters!  It is 11 l. 3 s. 10 d. sterling.-The number of
daily schools last year was upwards of 60; but before the
commencement of the present war it was greater.
   The number of poor upon the roll is 25, on an average;
but a good many more receive occasional assistance from our
funds, which are so good, that there are no vagrant poor
belonging to the parish.  The capital stock of the peers'
funds consists of land yielding 6 l. sterling of yearly rent, and
nearly 200 l. in money at interest.  The annual collections
amount to 23 l.; and for the use of mortcloths, burying
ground, dues on placing gravestones, etc. about 32 l. is drawn.
Besides these sources of income, one estate in the parish is
burdened with 5 l. and another with 3 l. 6 s. 8 d. annually, to
be distributed to poor householders within the parish.
