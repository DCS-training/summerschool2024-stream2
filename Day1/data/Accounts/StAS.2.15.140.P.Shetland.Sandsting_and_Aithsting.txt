Weights and Measures.-The instrument in general use for
weighing is called a 11 bysmer:" It weighs from one to twenty-
four merks.  One and one-fourth or half-pound make a rnerk, and
twenty-four merks make one lispund.  The lispund weight varies
in different parishes, and even in. different parts of the same pa-
rish, from 32 to 40 lbs.  Dr Barry, in his History of Orkney, ha's
given a particular description of the 11 bysmar," which I shall here
transcribe.  "The bysmer is a lever or bearn of wood, about three
feet long; and from one end to near the middle, it is a cylinder of
about three inches diameter, thence it gently tapbrs to the other
end,whichisnotaboveoneinchindiatneter.  Fromtbemiddle,all
along this smallest end, it is marked with small iron pins, at un-
eqUal distances, which serve to point out the weight, from one
merk to twenty-four, or a lispund.  The body to be weighed is
hung by a book in the small end of the instrument, which is then
suspended by a cord around it, held in the band of the weigher.,
who shifts it towards t6e one'end or the other, till the article he
is weighing equiponderates with the large end, which serves it as.
a counterpoise - and when they are in equilibrie, the pin nearest
the 6ord points out in the marks the weight of the subject weighed.",
Grain and meal manufactured iu the parish are weighed, and
bought and sold by 11 bysmer" weight.".
Measures.-Thette are a "can," by which oil is measured,'and
Which contains' one  gallon   the anker, or third part, of a barrel,
by wbic4 potatoes are measured,; and the ell, by which Shetland
claiih" is measured.

<FOOTNOTE>This cord'is tied round the ends of a round piece of wood, about four inches-
long, and held in the hand, and is called the snail."
