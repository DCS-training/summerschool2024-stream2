vants is necessary.  It would therefore be of infinite ad-
vantage to the possessors of low farms to have the Hill-im-
provements also in their possession, or portioned out upon
the common pasture, though they should pay the addition
of rent.  This observation, if applicable only to a parti-
cular district, would be foreign to the purpose; but it ex-
tends to a vast track of country; to the western districts of
Aberdeen, Banff and Murray shires; and a great part of
Inverness and Perth shires, which properly comprehend
the Highlands of Scotland.  Servants wages having in-
creased so prodigiously, it is more advantageous to the far-
mer to employ cottages or day labourers, for the purposes
of husbandry, where fuel and other necessaries can be con-
veniently had; but where it is otherwise, the difficulty
of collecting fuel for the tenant's own use, and also for the
cottagers, which would be necessary, if employed in his
service, would be unfurmontable.  Employing cottagers
or day labourers universally in this way, being generally
married, would have the good effect of increasing popula-
tion, as well as subjecting servants to more tolerable be-
haviour, where they must necessarily be had.  Still there
is one particular absolutely necessary to be observed,
which, is not attended to, will be an unfurmountable bar
to the farmer's industry.  It is the proper regulation of
the price of corn and meal; when meal can be had under
16 s. a boll, (144 lb. Averdupois,) the different classes of
labourers become idly disposed.  The wages of 1 half-year
will maintain them idle a great part of the year.

   Roads and Bridges.-The roads and bridges have for
some years been kept in repair, by statute labour exacted 
in kind.  The road from Grantown to Aviemore, 13
miles in length, was repaired in 1779 to 24 feet in
breadth, being formerly 12 feet, by the country people,
