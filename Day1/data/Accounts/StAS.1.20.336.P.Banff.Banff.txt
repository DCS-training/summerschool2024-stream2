belonged partly to the communion of the Church of Eng-
land, and partly to the Episcopal Church of Scotland.  But
in the year 1792, when a hill passed in Parliament, relie-
ving the laity of the later persuasion from those forfeitures,
penalties and disabilities, to which they had long been sub-
jected, both congregations, with a few exceptions, united
under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Bishop of Aberdeen.
   The chapel is conveniently situated, neat and commodi-
our, and has a well-toned small organ.
   The poor are admitted to the benefit of the public funds
of the parish; in return for which, an annual collection is 
made in the chapel on Christmas evening, which the cler-
gyman distributes indiscriminately to the poor of other per-
suations.
   The church of relief was built in the year 1780, is si-
tuated in the Seatown, and is a very commodious edifice.
The congregation, which is numerous, is composed partly
of families residing in Banff, and partly of people from
neihgbouring parishes.
   The numbers from this town and parish, according to a
communication of their minister, are as follows:

Of these are said to be examinable, 330.

   The poor of this congregation likewise share in the be-
nefit of the general funds; and a public collection is occa-
sionally mad in their church, for the relief of the poor at
large, which is usually committed to the disposal of the pa-
rish minister.
