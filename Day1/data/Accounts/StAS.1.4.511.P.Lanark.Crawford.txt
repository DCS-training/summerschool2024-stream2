   Lead Mines.-Leadhills contain in the most famous and an-
cient lead mines in Scotland.  There are two companies 
there, the affairs of which are conducted with great judg-
ment an deconomy.  The most considerable is that known
by the name of the Scotch Mining Company, of which Mr
Stirling is overseer.  The first object that strikes the eye,
in this mountainous region, is the spot of ground round
this gentleman's house.  The house itself is on the same
level with the top of Tintock, which is looked upon as a
very high hill in the part of the country where it is situa-
ted.  The spot I mention, cannot amount to more than 3
acres.  It contains, beside an house-stead, offices, and
counting-room, a bowling green, a garden, and a park
which feeds two cows, with strips of planting, which beau-
tifully interline an surround the whole.  The park is not
above an acre, yet, as I said, it feeds two cows.  The
ground within half a gun-shot of it, without the inclosure,
would be highly rented at 1 s. the acre.  This shews what
culture will effect even in a wilderness.  There are nearly
200 men employed by the Scotch Mining Company.
These are subdivided into pickmen, smelters, washers; and
labourers, besides carpenters and smiths.  The payment of
the pickmen depends upon the quantity of lead found.
Five or six of them join, and take what they call a bargain,
and according as it proves more or less productive of lead,
their wages are more or less.  But at an average, I am told
every man receives from L. 18 to L. 20 a year.  A smelter
receives fully as much.  Most of the washers are very
young, their wages therefore are less.  The labourers who
clear away rubbish from behind the pickmen, make each
from L. 12 to L. 14 a year.  Meal and barley are purcha-
sed by both overseers, and reserved in stores, out of which
all the bands employed by the respective Companies, re-
ceive every week a certain quantity for their families,
