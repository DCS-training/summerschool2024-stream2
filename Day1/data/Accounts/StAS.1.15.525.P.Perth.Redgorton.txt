river in Scotland; and, when joined by the Earn, below
Perth, is supposed to contain more fresh water than the
Thames.  There is a small lake in the disjoined part of this
parish, remarkable for it's depth in proportion to it's surface,
which produces large trout of a blackish colour, from one to
two pound weight, and upwards.  The river Tay, in this
neighbourhood, abounds with salmon, from sixteen to twen-
ty pound weight, at a medium; sea, or white trout, from
one to four pound; bull trout from one to thirty pounds;
a yellow trout from two pounds and downwards, and a few
pike and eels.  There is also to be found here a small sea
trout, called the Lammas whiting, from a quarter to half a
pound weight, of exquisite raise.  It is so called, from its
coming up from the sea at this season.  The salmon and
bull trouts are caught with nets, though there is excellent
rod-fishing, or angling in Tay, as well as in the other three
rivers, though in these there are no salmon but in the
spawning season.  The salmon fishings let to tacksmen, a-

staples in this country, and is generally sent to the London
market, or up the Mediterranean.  When sold here, they
bring in Spring 9 d. a pound, and 5 d. in Summer; though,
till within these 30 years, they were sold at 2 d per pound,
and were so very plentiful, (the export trade being not then
known) that in Perth and the neighbourhood, the servants
made an article at hiring time, that they should not get it
above twice a-week.
