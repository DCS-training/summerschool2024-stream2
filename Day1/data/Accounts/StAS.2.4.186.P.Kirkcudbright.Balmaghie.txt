<TABLE>
               Number of population under 15 years is            459
                                    between 15 and 30,           902
                                            30 and 50,           270
                                            50 and 70,           170
                                            70 and upwards,       51
                                                                1252


	Bachelors above fifty years of age are 10 in number; the unmar-
ried women above forty-five are 13. There are 3 fatuous and 2
blind persons. There is one deaf dumb boy, who is at present
receiving his education in Edinburgh. The average number of births
for the last seven years is 24 4/7; the average number of marriages
for the same period is 6. The inhabited houses are 226, and the
uninhabited, 9.
	The decrease of 164 in the population since 1831 is accounted
for by the circumstance, that, at the period, operation were car-
rying on to deepen the bed of the Dee, at the lower end of the
parish, with the view of facilitating the passage of the waters dur-
ing floods. This of course led to the employment and temporary
residence of a considerable number of workmen, who have since
passed away. The same circumstance accounts for the fact, that,
in the return for that period, the number of males was considerably
above that of females.
Bharacter and Habits of the People.--The people are in gene-
ral comfortably clothed and lodged, and they appear to be con-
tented. Most of the cottagers keep a pig or two, and, as the far-
mers are accustomed to allow potato land for the manure thus
produced; they are in this way supplied with an important article
of food.

                                IV.--INDUSTRY.
	Agriculture.--The staple employment is agricuture, and by
far the greater number of families is engaged in its pursuits
Upon the these, of course, the artisans and shop-keepers are depend-
ent for their support.
