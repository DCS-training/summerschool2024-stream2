places, to people from England.  They are generally sold
when three or four years old, and after being fattened a few
years in England, it is said, that they are reckoned superior
to English beef.  The cows are fattened in the parish, and
in the neighbourhood, and sold to the butchers of Glasgow,
Paisleuy, Greenock, and Dumbarton.

   Sheep.-This district is much better adapted for sheep,
than black cattle.  Among the high rocks, concealed deep
pits, and hanging precipices, black cattle could not pasture
with any safety; and, in former times, a very considerable
number of them were lost every season; but sheep can travel
through these places with great ease and security.  The cir-
cumstance which principally renders this country improper
for black cattle, is the want of provender in winter.  A
great number might be grazed in summer and harvest, but
there are no low lands from which to raise the tenth part of
the provender necessary for feeding them to advantage in
winter and spring; the provender, indeed, is rather scarce
for the small number of black cattle in the parish at present,
though there is double the quantity of hay made now, than
was made 30 years ago.  Accordingly, when this country
was cheifly stocked with black cattle, there was not a season
in which a great number of them did nor perish for want;
amd in bad seasons, it was very common for a tenant to lose a
third, and sometimes the half of his stock.  But there is now
provender prepared for the sheep, and, except in exceeding
bad years, when the snow comes on late in the spring, and
lies long upon the ground, there is never any considerable
loss.  John Campbell of Lagwine, from Ayrshire, was the
first person who stocked a farm with sheep in this parish, 35
years ago.  Some of his countrymen settled soon after, in
the neighbouring parishes.  The country people regarded he
