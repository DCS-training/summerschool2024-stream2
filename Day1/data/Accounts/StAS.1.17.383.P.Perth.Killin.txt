   Number of Horses, etc.-The number of horses in the pa-
rish is computed to be about 400, and of black cattle from
1780 to 1800.  They are mostly of the Highland breed,
except a few of the lowland or mixed breed, kept by some of
the gentlemen and better farmers.  Stocking with sheep is
now become so prevalent, that all the extensive grazings in
this country are laid under them.  The number of sheep
supposed to be in the parish, at present, is from 26,000 to
27,000, and all of them of the Linton breed.  Since pota-

numerous.  There are about 150 of them at present in this
parish.

   Mines, Minerals, etc.-The only mine in the parish is a
lead-mine, which has been wrought at Carn-drom, in the
west end of it, for these 40 years past.  But it is given up
for the present, which proves a temporary inconvenience to
a number of poor people in the village of Cliston, in its
neighbourhood, who depended chiefly for their subsistence
upon the employment they got in it.  There are no mineral
springs of any note in the parish.  Search has been repeat-
edly made for coals, but hitherto without success.  Peats,
and some barren timber, are the only fuel used.  Lime-stone
abounds in most parts of the parish.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Towards the beginning of the

very unfavourable to it.  The different clans spent a great
part of their time in avenging themselves of each other; the
man who could best handle his sword and his gun was deem-

was a character held in a degree of contempt.  The people,
