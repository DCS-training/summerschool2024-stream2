and, as there are no great landed proprietors or farmers among them,
they seem all pretty much on a footing of equality. Poaching in
game has certainly prevailed to a considerable extent; and though
strong measures have been of late taken for its suppression, it will
always prevail, to a certain extent, where property is so much di-
vided.

        Live Stock.-The sheep kept in this district are all Cheviot;
and the cattle are generally of the Galloway breed. A good deal
of attention has been paid to the improvement of sheep for these
last twenty years, by procuring the best Cheviot rams from the
east border. It has been found of late to answer a good purpose,
on some particular farms, to cross a part of the ewes with Leicester
rams. Though their lambs do not answer to be kept here as store-
sheep, they command very high prices for the English market.
