   A farm servant, when married, has a house and garden, a
cow's grass and fodder, ground to raise flax and potatoes for
his family, his peats led home, and oats out of the barn, to
the value of L 8 Sterling.  Labourers who thresh the grain
recieve the 25th part for their labour.  They are employed
in other work when the threshing is over, for which they
receive an house and garden, grass and sodder for a cow,
ground for potatoes, and flax and oats out of the barn, to

rates, very seldom above them:  Men at L. 7 Sterling; wo-

fuel is commonly procured in the parish of Kirkinner.  Coals
are brought from Cumberland at 19 s. the ton.  The scarci-
ty of fuel is the greatest disadvantage under which this neigh-
bourhood labours, and yet it is within four hours failing
from the English coal mines.  The tax upon that necessary
article, when water borne, is the cause of its high price; and
here that tax is a real grievance.  Its bad effects, and un-
friendly influence on manufactures, are evident.  A small
duty, raised at the pit, would affect every consumer equally,
and be more productive.  Our legislators will surely embrace
some sit opportunity of revising the coal and salt laws:  And,
it is humbly hoped that the honourable member to whom
