"On the 18th November 1830, the temperature of the water
of spring No. 3, as it issues from the rock in the mine, was 51.&deg;25.
At the same time the temperature of the air of the mine was 52&deg;.
The temperature, as it falls from the pump in the pump-toom,
about an hour after the preceding observations in the mine, was
49.&deg;25, the air of the room being at the same time 49.&deg;50. The
quantity of water delivered by this spring in twenty-four hours
was, on the 18th November 1830, in round numbers, 1260 impe-
rial gallons; and the tacksman informs me that the supply is not
much affected by the seasons, The water is transparent and co-
lourless, and destitute of smell. Its taste is better and unplea-
sant.
   "On the same day, the average temperature of the two springs,
Nos. 1 and 2 was 50&deg;, the temperature of the mine being 52&deg;.
