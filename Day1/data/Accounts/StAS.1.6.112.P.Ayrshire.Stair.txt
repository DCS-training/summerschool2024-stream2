     NUMBER XVI.

     PARISH OF STAIR.

     (PRESBYTERY, SYNOD, AND COUNTY OF AIR.)

     By the Rev. JOHN STEEL, of Gadgirth.

     Date of Erection.

   STAIR was first erected into a parish in 1653, for the ac-
commodation of the noble family of Dalrymple of Stair,
whose residence was a great distance from Ochiltree, their pa-
rish church.  With a view to this accommodation, that family
agreed to pay three chalders of victual, one half of the stipend
then allotted to the minister.  The other half was to be paid
by the parish of Barnwell, then suppressed and united to the
adjoining parishes of Craigie and Torbolton.  On account
of some differences between the parties concerned in the
transaction, and a wrong locality of the stipend, the errors
of the first erection were rectified by a new process in 1709,
when several lands were disjoined from, and others united
to, the parish.  This new erection, though it produced a
different locality, made no alteration in the sum of the sti-
pend; which, however small or inadequate to the sup-
port of a family, remains still unaugmented, though in some
years it has produced no more to the incumbent than L. 35.
