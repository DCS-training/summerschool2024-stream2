     Statistical Account

   Potatoes are cultivated in considerable quantities in this
parish, as over the rest of Scotland; but do not enter inva-
riably into the rotation, and are not in any peculiar degree
a favourite article of crop.
   Various sorts of seed-oats have been tried here.  Blains-
ley oats and red oats are the two species the most generally
sown.  Red oats are found to succeed peculiarly well on
the soil and in the climate of Legerwood; yielding, at an
average, eight bolls in the hundred of larger increase than
any other sort of seed oats; thickening surprisingly on the
field as they grow up, from a thin sowing; enduring the
autumnal winds with comparatively little shaking of the
ears; affording the best straw; and giving, in meal, half a
stone more from the boll of rough corn, than the Blainsley
oats yield.
   But turnips are, above all others, the favourite article of
crop.  They are precious, as green food, equally to sheep
and black cattle during winter; the manure and culture
necessary to produce a crop of turnips, serve admirably to
prepare the field for the cultivation and produce of the en-
suing year; the waste of the turnips that remains uncon-
sumed by the cattle, forms also a rich manure to the ground
on which they are scattered.
   Horses are the only beasts of draught or burden employ-
ed in this parish.  All the implements of husbandry, carts,
ploughs, harrows, etc. are of the most advantageous con-
struction known in the county.  A double plough for tur-
nips, the invention of Mr Paterson, and formed to be drawn
by one or two horses, is also in use here, and is found to
afford a very convenient abridgment of labour.  Two
threshing-machines have been already erected in this parish,
and there is a third about to be set up in the present sum-
mer (1795), at the first cost of from L. 60 to L. 100 Ster-
ling.  But this expence is quickly repaid by the saving of
labour, which is obtained from the use of the threshing-
