-A manse was first built in 1787.-A house is also appro-
priated for the parish school.  The number of scholars that
attend it, is from 40 to 50.  The wages are 2 s per quarter for
English; 2 s 6 d for writing; and 3 s for arithmetic.  There

poor in this part of the country, but, from various causes, they
have proved unsuccessful.

grounds belonging to the community, and has been wrought
