received the name of the "mutiny stones;" but there is no au-

               <TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>
   In 1712, there were 300 examinable persons, which may give
a population of 450. When the last Statistical Account was
drawn up, there were computed to be 100 families containing 452
individuals. Since the beginning of this century the numbers have
been accurately ascertained every ten years as follows: There
were in
     1801, 94 families, containing 2O7 males and l99 females,  Total  406
     1811, 90,        -      -     215,     -    229,        -        444
     1821, 81,        -      -     191,     -    211,        -        402
     1831, 81,        -      -     216,     -    209,        -        425
   The families are fewer in number than they used to be, owing
to several smaller farms being now thrown into one. The system
of large sheep-farms prevails more than it used to do, in conse-
quence of which there is less ground cultivated, and fewer fami-
lies maintained.

   Agriculture and Rural Economy.-The extent of this parish is
about thirty-three square miles, or rather more than 21000 acres
imperial.
Of this amount there are cultivated, or occasionally in tillage,     -        2200

   It may be doubted whether capital could be profitably employed
in cultivating more of the parish than has already been cultivated.
   In the vicinity of the village of Longformacus, there is a good
deal of planting, especially surrounding the mansion-house of
Longformacus, where there are some elm and ash trees of con-
siderable age and height. There are also extensive plantations
at the Retreat, on the lands of Blackerstone.
   Husbandry.-Barley, oats, turnips, potatoes, rye-grass and
clover, are the usual crops cultivated. There are about 450 score
sheep pastured. Of this number there are about 300 score
