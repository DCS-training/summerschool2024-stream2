   Houses.-There has not been one house of any note built
within these 10 years, except the manse, and 2 convenient
farm houses.  Several cottages have been built, many old
ones pulled down and rebuilt, and others have been repaired.
For want of sufficient buildings, the generality of the small
farmers employ a great part of every summer in repairing
their huts, to the neglect of improving their farms, by col-
lecting, in that season, materials for manure.  The number
of houses in the parish is 248, all inhabited; and the num-
ber of persons in each, at an average, is 5.

   Servants and Cottagers.-Hired servants are employed in
agriculture; but as the wages in this country are low, many
go to the southern part of the kingdom for service, and few
of the young men stay at home, except those whose parents
have employment for them.  The number of male servants
is 52; of female servants, 176.  The wages of men servants,
from 1 L. 4 s. to 3 L. yearly, besides shoes, and 6 bolls of meal
for board wages; and of women servants, from 1 L. to 10 s.
with shoes, and 3 bolls of meal for board wages.  Such tacks-
men as have sub-tenants, employ them in spring and harvest
too frequently to cultivate their land, to the almost utter ne-
glect of their own small farms.  To abolish this species of fla-
avery, (which is doubtless in the power of every proprietor,
when giving leases), would surely be a patriotic act, by which a 
great number of worthy people would be emancipated from
a degree of bondage almost equal to that of the negroes in
the West Indies.  There are indeed some few exceptions.
Some tacksmen are kind and benevolent, and support their
subtenants in calamitous times; but the generality naturally
prefer their own interest to every other consideration.
