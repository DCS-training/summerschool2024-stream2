   The late James Byres, Esq. of Tonley. by whom these and
many other articles of curiosity were brought together, and who
died here at a very advanced age in 1817, was a gentleman highly
distinguished for his profound knowledge of architectural antiqui-
ties, and the fine arts in general, and no less respected for his
sterling worth, by those who were unable to estimate these ac-
quirements.  A great part of his life was spent at Rome, where
he gave lectures, at one period, on the favourite objects of his
study; and Sir James Hall, who has occasion, in his work on
Gothic architecture, frequently to refer to his authority, bears
testimony, as well as many other writers, to "the very great success
with which he contributed to form the taste of his young country-
men."  A curious and valuable work of his, on the Sepulchres of
Etruria, is likely soon to be given to the public, which will show
that he had anticipated, by half a century, many of the recent in-
vestigations of these monuments of antiquity.

       Of unmarried men above 50 the numbers are, bachelors, 2; widowers, 15
       Of women above 45, there are 33 maids, and 27 widows.

   This increase of the population is owing to the extended and
improved cultivation, and to the encouragement that has been
given to small crofters on the estate of the principal proprietor.
There is no village, nor any manufacturing establishment.
   The number of insane or fatuous persons is 3.

   Agriculture.-The quantity of land in tillage is about 2970 im-
perial acres; the quantity of waste land, 2260 acres, of which
400 or 500 might perhaps, with proper drainage, be brought into
profitable cultivation.  The range of hills which bounds the pa-
rish on the south, extending to 6000 or 7000 acres, is in a state
of undivided common; but what proportion of that tract belongs
to this parish, it is hard to say, and no part of it is included in the
above estimate.  A process for the division of this common is at
