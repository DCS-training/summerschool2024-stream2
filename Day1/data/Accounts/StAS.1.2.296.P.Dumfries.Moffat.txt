   Mineral Springs.-There are two mineral springs in the
parish; both well known, and justly celebrated for their me-
dicinal virtues.
   The first has long ago been distinguished by the name of
Moffat Well, and is a strong sulphureous water, about a mile
and a half from the village; with an excellent carriage road to
it, and a long room and stables, and other conveniences, upon
the spot, for the use of the company, when they are drinking
the waters.  This well was discovered more than 150 years ago;

jury to their health.  It is sparkles in the glass like champaign,
and is so remarkably volatile, that it cannot be drunk in per-

chemical analysis was made of it, in the year 1659, by Mr
M,Kaile, and since that time by Mr Milligan and Dr Plummer.
   The other mineral spring is known by the name of the
Hartsell Spaw, and is four miles distant from the village.  It
is a powerful chalybeate, and therefore taken only in small
quantities.  It possesses a very singular property, of being
strongest after heavy rains; but when taken up then, and pro-
