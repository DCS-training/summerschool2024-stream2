620                Statistical Account, &c.

  Many of the facts, with which I have now furnished you,
are curious.
  They point out the gradual progress of commerce and luxu-
ry, and the corresponding effect upon manners; and shew
by what imperceptible degrees society may advance to re-
finement, and in some points to corruption, whilst matters of
real utility may be neglected.
  Observations similar to the preceding may perhaps be made
in every capital town or city in Great Britain; and, if the exam-
ple I have now given is followed, much useful information may
be gained respecting trade, manners, and police. This is the
more to be wished for, as the prosperity and happiness of every
nation must depend upon its virtue, and on the wisdom and
due execution of its laws.
  The information I have given is only and outline. It would
have required a volume to have gone minutely into particu-
lars.
  Your zeal and public spirit have stimulated a research
which never was equalled in any country, and it may prove
highly beneficial to mankind in general. Every good citizen
of the state is bound to wish well to the undertaking, and, ac-
cording to his opportunities, to promote its success. My best
exertions, on every occasion of such a nature, you may always
depend on. - I remain, - with much esteem,

                  SIR,

                      Your most obedient,

  Edinburgh,                 Humble servant,
  Decr. 1792.       
                              WILLIAM CREECH.
