forms the boundary of the parish for nearly 2 miles.  There
is one small harbour at Port Seton, which, previous to the
Union, was a place of considerable resort, being the nearest
port to Prestonpans, whose merchants had upwards of 20
vessels belonging to them.  At present, the shipping is con-
fined to a few cast country and coasting vessels.  The imports
are timber and iron, and sometimes corn and malt, for the
accommodation of neighbouring distilleries.  The chief, if
not the only export, is salt.  The shore-dues seldom exceed
30 L.
   A manufacture of great salt, of a very particular fine quali-
ty, was established here a few years ago by Dr Schwediaur;
but, from various circumstances, the scheme totally failed.
In Cockenzie, which connects with this village, the manu-
facture of common salt is carried on to great advantage and
extent, 10 or 11 pans being constantly at work.  The inter-
nal resource of coal which the proprietor enjoys, gives a de-
cided superiority over every other person, who must either
import his coals, or purchase them from the nearest coal-
master.
   Off the coast, there is a considerable oyster-scalp; but, of
late years, the oysters have become very scarce.  This must
be attributed to over-dragging several years ago, to supply
English vessels from Milton, Lee, and other places.  Before
this, a boat would sometimes drag 9000 a day, which, at 5 d.
6 d. and 7 d. a hundred, afforded a handsome income to the
crew.  The common average lay betwixt 4000 and 7000.
At present, 700 or 800 are reckoned a good day's work,
which, though now sold indiscriminately at 15 d. per hun-
dred, afford but a scanty livelihood when divided amongst
5 men, including a double deal to the owner of the boat.
There are at present 10 boats, belonging to Cockenzie and
Port Seton, engaged in this fishing.  Upwards of 20,000
