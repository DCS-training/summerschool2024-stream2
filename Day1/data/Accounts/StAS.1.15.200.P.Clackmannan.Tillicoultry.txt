For two or three years we were visited with a magpie, which
was not variegated with black and white plumage, but was
entirely white,-" Rara avis in terris".  The other magpies
associated with him, and did not consider him in any degree
as strange.  In the hills there are muir-fowls, plovers and
dotterels.  The muir-fowls are not so frequent as formerly,
as the heath is wearing out, and in consequence of this the
shelter is not so good.  The birds of passage are swallows,

seen on the hills.  The wild quadrupeds are, hares, rabbits,
foxes, hedge-hogs, weasels, polecats, badgers and otters.  The
skin of the otter is valuable as a fur, and fetches a good
price.

   Orchards and Plantations.-There are two small orchards,
planted chiefly with apple trees, which contain about six
acres, and, some years, bear considerable quantities of fruit,
Above 100 acres are planted with forest trees and many of
the inclosures are surrounded with single rows of planting.
All kinds of forest trees thrive well, particularly oaks, elms,
ashes, beeches planes, and Scotch firs*.

   Climate.-The air is healthy, dry, and warm, subject neither
to fogs nor damps.  Snow does not lie long on the low ground,
particularly between the Devon and the hills, which is pro-
bably owing to the natural warmth of the air or soil.  The
healthiness of the two villages, at the foot of the hills, is un-

near the manse, that the crows and magpies built their nests in the branches.
