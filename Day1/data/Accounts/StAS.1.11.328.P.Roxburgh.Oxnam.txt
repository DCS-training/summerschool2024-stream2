     Statistical Account

harvest begins, for the most part, with September; the corn
is all cut in 20 or 21 working days; and, in 5 or 6 after, it
is generally secured in the barns, and barn-yards, except when
the seasons prove cold and wet.

   Implements of Husbandry.-There are 42 ploughs and 52
carts in the parish.  The old Scotch plough is entirely laid
aside, and the new construction with metal mould boards, uni-
versally adopted.  Two stout horses, driven by the plough-
man, are quite sufficient, except in a few' instances, where 3
horses are used, and a driver.  Carts, of a light make, on
wheels 4 feet 8 inches high, commonly stayed with iron at
each corner, are used for coal and lime; and the long cart
with rung and sheth, for corn, peat and turf*.

   Wages.-Tradesmen are paid as follows:

*Before the introduction of carts, a clumsy unweildy carriage, upon 2 wheels,
drawn by 2 oxen, and 2, or sometimes 4, horses called a wain, was used merely
for dragging dung to the field, and bringing home corn hay and wood.
