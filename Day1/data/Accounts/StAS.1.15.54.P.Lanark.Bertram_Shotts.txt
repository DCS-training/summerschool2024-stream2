   Roads.-The great road, which at present leads from Glas-
gow to Edinburgh, passes through this parish, and divides it
nearly into two equal parts.  In this, as in the other roads
formed at that period, a streight rather than a level line was
sought.  To this absurd and inconsiderate idea, are many of
the pulls in it to be ascribed.  A bill has been lately obtain-
ed, to carry a road from Glasgow to Edinburgh, by the vil-
lages of Ardric and Bathgate.  In this bill there is also a
clause, impowering Colonel Dalrymple of Cleland to make a
line, which leaves the Shotts road at Bells-hill, and returns to
it at the confines of Whirburn parish.  Each of these pass
though this parish, the first, two miles N. of the Church, the
second, two miles S. of it.  In self defence, the trustees upon
the Shotts roads have now in many places eased the pulls in
it greatly; and to avoid the Hirst altogether, the road is now
carried nearly in a dead level, round the north end of that
hill.  The advantages derived by the public, from the late
wonderful improvement upon roads, are indeed astonishing.
The journey which, 40 years ago, the traveller could only
accomplish in two days, he now executes in five or six hours.
The expedition, and encreased burden of draught horses are
equally striking, and still more beneficial.  The statute work
of this parish, though it be commuted, and very regularly le-
vied, is far from being sufficient to keep the many roads, in
so wide a district of country, in any tolerable repair.
   Ecclesiaslical State.-The present kirk of Shotts is a long
narrow building, situated due E. and W.  What changes
it has undergone, since its erection in 1450, do not ap-
