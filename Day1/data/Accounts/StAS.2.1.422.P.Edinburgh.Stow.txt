ly used, and as the first cross is always the best, that the breeders
in every case should be the real Ayrshire.  To follow this rule
exactly, would be extremely difficult, but it may be important to
make the nearest approach to it that the circumstances will ad-
mit.
   Turnip Feeding.--The number of cattle fed on turnips when the
last Statistical Account was drawn up, is stated at 90, and the
sheep at six score.  We have calculated the former to be at pre-
sent upwards of 500.  As to the last I can give no probable con-
jecture.
   The general character of the husbandry pursued is excellent.
Every branch of rural economy is well understood and skilfully
practised.
   Leases.--The general duration of leases is nineteen years,
though in some cases they extend only to from nine to fourteen.
   The state of farm-buildings has been of late much improved,
both as regards dwelling-houses and offices.  Farm-houses, with
scarcely an exception, are neat, substantial, and commodious
buildings of two stories high, with garrets.  Enclosures, chiefly of
drystone dikes, are continually extending.
   Produce of the Parish.--Taking the whole parish to follow the
five shift course of husbandry, the produce will be nearly as fol-
lows:--

   It is to be remembered that turnips and potatoes, though here
valued as raw produce, are actually all consumed on the farm, as
is often the case with a good deal of the bay.  It is to be consi-
dered, therefore, as merged in fat cattle, sheep, dairy, &c., which
last may be estimated at L.2000.
