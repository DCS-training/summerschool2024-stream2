   Population.-There is no account on record, within the
parish, of the number of inhabitants in a former period; but,
in a printed account, anno 1774, of the Society for Propa-
gating Christian Knowledge, there is a statement of the po-
pulation in the respective parishes, which, is it is accurate,
shews the numbers to be increased.  Walls contained 756
souls; Sandness, 468; Papa, 240; Fowla, 130.  In all 1594.
The population, in 1755, according to Dr Webster's account,
was 1450.
