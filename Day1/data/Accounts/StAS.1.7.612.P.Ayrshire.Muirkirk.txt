"will avenge this another day:" Such are the blessed effects

   Size, Manners of the People, etc.-Nothing very singular
distinguishes the people here from those of other parishes of
the like nature They are of the ordinary size in general,
and of a healthy and robust constitution.  There turn of
mind, so far as it is peculiar, is, in a great degree, formed
