nity of confusion, uncertainty, and terror, to have himself
proclaimed Lord Paramount of Scotland; and finding Bal-
liol not unwilling to acknowledge this supremacy, he de-
cided the contest in his favour.  But Edward soon hurled
him from the throne, under the pretence that he had only
put the sceptre into his hands to be swayed in trust.  The
troops of the English monarch soon over-ran many of the
most important districts of this kingdom; and in triumph
carried to Westminster the stone of Scone, which was made
somewhat in the form of a chair, in which the Kings of
Scotland had been in use to be seated at the time of their
coronation.
   In this season of national dejection and dismay, appeared
William Wallace, of an ancient, but at that time an ob-
scure family*.  He listed up the standard of liberty, and
many flocked around the signal.  But still there were not
a few, who through envy or fear would not join the pa-
triots.  But Wallace and his adherents prevailed.  They
fought and were successful.  They drove the English be-
yond the borders, and entered the countries in the north of
Edward's kingdom.
   When the King of England was informed of these events,
he returned from the continent where he had been with an
army; and marching into Scotland, he advanced with vic-
torious bands through that country, meeting with little re-
sistance till he came to Falkirk.
   Having come within view of the Scotch army, they saw
them drawn up in battle array, somewhat more than half
a mile north from Falkirk.  Before this time many persons
of eminence and power had joined the party of Wallace.
