   There is an Episcopalian chapel in the village containing 150
sittings, the number of persons in connection with which, in this
and the neighbouring parishes, is about 130 ; but, with the excep-
tion of 28 persons within the parish who belong to that commu-
nion, and three other Dissenting, individuals, all the rest of the po-
pulation attend the parish church, where Divine service is always
well attended.  The average number of communicants at the Es-
tablished Church for the last seven years is 506 ; for the last three
years, 538.
   Education.-This parish is well provided with the means of edu-
cation.  There are two public schools in it, the parochial school,
and another endowed school called Lord Cullen's School, in each
of which the usual branches of education are taught, viz English
reading, writing, Latin, arithmetic, book-keeping, English gram-
mar, geography, &c.
   Lord Cullen's School is so named in consequence of its endow-
ment from a mortification by Sir Francis Grant of Cullen, Bart.
one of the Senators of the College of Justice, and proprietor of the
estate of Monymusk, as already mentioned, who, by a deed bearing
date 11th August 1718, mortified 2 chalders of meal yearly out
of the estate of Monymusk and Afforsk, to and in favour of such
country teachers as the minister and kirk-session for the time being
should name or approve, and in such division yearly as might best
serve the end set forth in the deed.  This continued for a good
number of years under the management of the kirk-session, as ori-
ginally intended; but, owing to circumstances which placed the
mortification for a long time, as it were, in abeyance, the annual value
of the two chalders was allowed to accumulate to a very considerable
sum, which, after building an excellent school and schoolmaster's
house, and enclosing a garden in the year 1824, north of the river
Don, where the benefit of a teacher was most wanted, and defray-
ing other necessary expenses, has been invested, for better se-
curity, in Bank of England Stock.  The management of this ac-
cumulated fund, and of the annual two chalders, according to
a plan prepared by a committee of the presbytery of Garioch, who
have the oversight of it, and agreed to on the part of the proprietor
of Monymusk, and by the kirk-session, and sanctioned by the
Lords of Council and Session,-is vested in the " Heritor of Mony-
musk, or the legal administrator of the estate for the time being,
