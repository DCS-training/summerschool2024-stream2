royal hunting seat, which is probable from the names of
some farms, belonging to the Earl of Northesk, lying very

present incumbent imported from East-Lothian); no grass-
seeds, nor summer-sallow, few inclosures, and those of earth.
At present, agriculture, in every branch, is in a state of culti-

with a rapid progress.  And within these 10 or 12 years, a
spirit of improvements has been particularly observable.  Far-
mers are so sensible of the advantages of inclosures, that all
the fences now going on are of stone.  Their houses of late,
especially of those who have any encouragement, from the
