     of Leuchars.

   Church, Stipend, School and Poor.-The church of Leuchars
is placed nearly in the middle of the parish.  It is an ancient
losty building, part of it very ancient, situated on a rising
ground.  The building is more than sufficient to hold the pa-
rishioners.  There is no record by which the time of its erec-
tion can be fixed, and there is even no tradition on the subject.
The church was once the only one in Scotland whose steeple
ascended on the east end of the building.  The time was,
when our forefathers worshipped here according to the forms
of the Romish church.  The door through which the organist
entered to perform that part of the service allotted to him, is
still seen in the east gable of the church; and the place where
the holy water was kept to purify the worshippers on their
entry into this temple is also visible.  The iron hook on which
was suspended the lever for weighing meal on the Lord's day,
is batted into the key stone of an arch in the steeple; and in
the place below, other merchant wares were sold on that
holy day.
   A very little west of the present church, once stood a cha-
pel called St Bernard's chapel; no remains of this monument
of antiquity are now visible, the stones of it having been used
for common purposes.  Round where it stood are to be seen
many graves, constructed of 4, and some of 6 stones.  Some
of these graves have lately been looked into without affording
any thing worthy of being recorded.
   There is a most excellent well flowing with an abundant
stream of soft water, near the west end of the village, (for the
village is now extending westward,) called by the name of
the Saint, to whom the chapel was no doubt consecrated.
A little north of the east end of the village, to the conve-
nience and comfort of the inhabitants, there is another well
of equal excellence, called the Lady well, no doubt conse-
crated to the Blessed Virgin.  Tradition says, there once
