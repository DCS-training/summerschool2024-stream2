would be a great advantage to the labouring poor in Old
Meldrum, if such a quantity of coals were laid in during
summer as would serve them, and then fold out to them in
winter as their necessities called for.  It would also be a
great accomodation to the inhabitants of the whole pa-
rish, and this corner of the country, if the public roads
from Old Meldrum to the nearest sea-port towns, Aber-
deen and Newburgh, were kept in better repair; especi-
ally to the latter place, which is nearer by 4 Scotch miles
than Aberdeen; and where both lime and coals are im-
ported, and generally sold cheaper than at Aberdeen.
   The people in general are active and industrious, and
some of them of no little enterprize.  They are, as was al-
ready observed, very liberal to the poor.
