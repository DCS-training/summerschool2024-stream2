in 6 or 7 years past, several who had always resided in it died
between 70 and 90 years old; and there are now living in it
a man and a woman at the advanced age of between 90 and
100.

to the monopolizing of farms; 10 or 12 small farms, which
supported as many families, having been at different times add-
ed to larger ones, in the cultivation of which the farmers em-
ploy not cottagers, but young unmarried men.  The return
to Dr Webster in 1755, however was only 290 souls.  The
present state is as follows:
