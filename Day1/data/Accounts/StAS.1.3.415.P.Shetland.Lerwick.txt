as can well be supposed, from the situation and climate.  The 
highest hill in the parish rises little more than 300 feet above

kets, particularly those of Spain and Italy, is, at an average,
800 tons from all the islands.  There is a very considerable
herring fishery on the coast, carried on wholly by foreigners;
200 busses frm Holland, 50 from Denmark, 40 from
Prussia, 20 from Dunkirk, and about the same number
from the Austrian Netherlands, are employed every summer
in this fishery.  They generally put into Bressay Sound before
the fishery, which, with the Dutch in particular, does not
commence until the 24th of June.  The Dutch formerly
