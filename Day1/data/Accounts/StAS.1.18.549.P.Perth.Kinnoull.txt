   Population.-The population of this parish, is greatly en-
creased within the last 8 or 10 years, although some small
crofts have been conjoined, and several cottage-houses desert-
ed, which should naturally have diminished the population.
This increase of inhabitants is not owing to any manufac-
tures established in the parish, for there are none; but it is
chiefly to be ascribed, to the toll being taken off the bridge of
Perth; a circumstance which has induced many tradesmen and
others, to purchase ground, and build houses in the village of
Bridge-end, who would not otherwise have thought of it;
and there is a great probability, that the parish will still in-
crease, as the village of Bridge-end, from its situation, pro-
mises in time, to become considerable.
