duct of the three sons of Erc, called Lorn, Angus, and Fer-
gus; who became the second founders of the kingdom of the
Scots, or, as they were still called, Dalruaidhini.  At that
time the sons of Erc must have been far advanced in life, for
they had all got the benediction of St. Patrick, who died in
442.  Angus seems to have died soon after big arrival in this
country, for we hear no more of him.  In the division of
the country, Ilay probably fell to his share; as, after his
death, we find it possessed by his son Murdach, whose wi-
dow Erca, the daughter of Lorn, was afterwards married
to his cousin-german, the son of Conal of Ireland, to whom
she bore Felim, the father of St. Columba, the Apostle of
the Highlands.
   Of the main land, Lorn took the northern division, which
still retains his name; and Fergus the southern, or Kintyre
and Argyll.  Lorn dying in a short time, Fergus added his
brother's territory to his own, and so became sole monarch
of the Scots or Dalruaidhini; and he has stood ever since at
the head of our list of Scottish Kings.  From the Irish sea,
his territory extended northward to Drumalbin, or Tyn-
drum; and was bounded on the east by the kingdom of the
Britons of Strath-Clyde, whose capital (while the kingdom
existed) was A cluith or Balclutha, now Dumburton, a cor-
ruption of Dun-Briton.  On the north it was bounded by
the kingdom of the Picts, whose capital at that time was
Inverness.
   As the Dasreudinian Kings of the line of Fergus, had, for
some centuries, their residence in this parish, where they were
surrounded by the most fertile tract they were possessed of,
and where they had the safest and most commodious harbour,
in their whole territory, for their fleet, it may perhaps be ex-
pected, in a history of this parish, that some brief account
should be given of them; and that so many Kings should not
