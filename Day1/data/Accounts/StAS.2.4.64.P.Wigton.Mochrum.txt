but being seized with fever, and there being no medical man on
board, he died soon after his arrival in London, leaving behind
him a name for professional merit, general honour, and integrity
of character inferior to none. (Murray's Literary History of Gal-

                          III.-POPULATION.
	 In the former Stastical Account, it is observed, "there is,
perhaps, no country parish in the county that has increased so much
in population as Mochrum for these last twenty years. The inha-
bitants, who now amount to 1400, it is certain, did not exceed half
the number previous to that period. This increase has been al-
most entirely effected on Sir William Maxwell's estate, who, car-
rying on extensive plans of improvement upon the lands which he
held in his own natural possession, had occasion to employ a num-
ber of additional labourers, and these happening to consist mostly
of young, stout, newly married Irishmen, this prolific race soon
contributed largely to the human stock."
