the parish-funds, may not always be sufficient fully to main-
tain them, yet, by their own little industry, with what they
get, they are enabled to live with some degree of comfort.
And, in cases of old age and sickness, more ample provisions
are made for them.  From 1 s to 2 s. a-week is generally al-
lowed.  And all this is conducted by the advice of the session,
who make it their business to inquire into every one's parti-

Orphans and idiots are generally boarded at the yearly ex-
pense of 4 L., and sometimes a little more.  The parish has
not been assessed for the maintenance of the poor, so far back
as can be remembered.

The pits are not deep, from 3 to 22 fathoms.  Coals abound
so much in some parts of the parish, that farmers, in digging
their ditches, often discover a thin seam, which they dig out
for the use of their families, and sometimes also in such quan-
tities, as are employed in burning limestones for their farms
Limestones also abound in many parts of the parish, in seams
of considerable thickness.  These are sold at different prices,
according to the trouble that attends the working them, and
in proportion to the quantity of lime they produce.  The low-
