medium depth of rain water fallen in a year, will be

   The most prevalent winds all along the coast of Mur-
ray are from the S. W.  They may be said to prevail
for two-thirds of the year.  Perhaps the greatest defect
in the temperature of our climate is the cold N. E.
winds, that commonly prevail in the months of April
and May, which often retard the growth of the corns,
and especially of the grass, and are very severe on deli-
cate constitutions.  This is an inconvenience that is felt
over almost all the E. coast of Britain; but is particu-
larly so in situations like this, which are open, and ex-
posed to the N. and E. Perhaps it might tend to lessen
this inconvenience, if strips of wood were planted at cer-
tain distances where the country is level.
