posed for drunkenness, and for acting as factor to a neighbouring
proprietor, having refused to give up either them or the plate be-
longing to the church.  They are exceedingly defective, especially
for the last sixty years.  With regard to mere sessional records, it
seems now to be pretty generally allowed, that except in very ag-
gravated cases, or in those which must be brought before higher
courts, it hardly consists with that "charity which rejoiceth not in
iniquity," to record the name of every one who may have been
"overtaken in a fault," and thus to set him up for ever on the pil-
lory, as it were, to the scorn and laughter of future generations.
As to the other records of the session, many are not only unwilling
but unable to pay for the registering of births or marriages, from
which they may never derive any benefit; and certainly it would
be harsh to compel the poor so to do, who have generally more
than enough of indispensable outlay on such occasions. * In the
records of this parish, however, there are two or three cases of
some interest mentioned, as showing the sate of the times in for-
mer ages, and especially after the revolution.  There is the case of
a woman in 1694 charged with having burnt the Bible, lest it
should be a witness against her inthe great day of accounts; ano-
ther of a man in 1696 for having counsulted "a wise man" in Car-
rington parish, respecting some money which he said had been
stolen from him; and in a stray paper found in the parish, there
is a very serious but amusing account given of the settlement of a
minister in this parish before the restoration of patronage, by the
interference of the principal heritor, a Catholic, with the elders
who lived on his estate.  And finally, a tradition is still prevalent,
and it is confirmed in many points by the records of presbytery, of
the miserable death of two women who had accused a minister of
the parish of gross scandal, which induced him, though innocent,
to give up his charge, that "the name of God and his doctrine
might not be blasphemed."
     It may not be out of place here to remark, that this district was
not much harassed during the dreadful times of the Covenant. "A
conventicle" was on one occasion held at the Glen, partly that the
