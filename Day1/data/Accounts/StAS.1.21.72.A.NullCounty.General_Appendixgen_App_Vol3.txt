     Parish of Polmont.

     Corrections by the Rev. William Finlay.

   The parish of Polmont is not intersected, but bounded, by
the Frith of Forth on the north, and by the river Avon on
the east.  A small part of it is interfete'ted by a short cut from
Grangemouth to the Forth, which now form, the only navi-
gable communication betwixt that arid the Great Canal.-
The ironstone is sold by the proprietors of land to the Carron
Company, not at tenpence per stone, but at tenpence per ton.-
The annual amount of funds for the relief of the poor is not
twenty-eight pounds, but about fifty-five, and the expenditure
about fifty-two.-By an interlocutor of the Tiend Court,
June 1793, the stipend of this parish is ordained to be 111
bolls, 2 firlots, 1 peck, 2 lippies bear, 56 bolls of meal, and
L. 152:10:10 Scots money, with L. 60 money foresaid for fur-
nishing the communion elements.-The real rent of the par-
ish amounts to about L. 4000 sterling per annum.

     Parish of Hoddam.
     Corrections by the Rev. James Yorstoun.

   The parish of Luce, which was united to that of Hoddam,
is, in the Statistical Account, erroneously called the parish of
Line.
