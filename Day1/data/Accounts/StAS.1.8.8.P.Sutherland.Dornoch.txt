subdivision of farms, and the advancing culture of small crofts
and muir ground, the people in general are encouraged to
marry young.  It may be added, that by the partial intro-
duction of inoculation for the small-pox, and by the im-
proved treatment of patients under that disease, which has of
late years been pretty generally adopted, even by those who
are not yet reconciled to inoculation itself, many lives have
been saved, and other fatal disorders prevented.  Since the
returns, Dr. Webster, however, in 1755, there has been a
decrease upon the whole, as will appear upon inspecting the
following table.

<FOOTNOTE>

*There may be upwards of 20 persons included in the above number, be-
longing to this parish, and occasionally residing in it, who make a practice of
going yearly to the south of Scotland to work, during, at least, the summer and
autumn.  There is also included in the above enumeration, a district situated in
the bosom of the parish of Rogart, containing 113 souls.  There is no register of
burials kept here, nor would it convey any satisfactory information if there
were, because many families continue to bury here, though they no longer
reside in the parish; while others, now resident here, bury elsewhere.
