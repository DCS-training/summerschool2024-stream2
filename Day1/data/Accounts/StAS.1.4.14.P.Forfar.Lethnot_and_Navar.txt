     Statistical Account

   School.-There are two schools within the parishes; the
established school, and another founded on private donation.
The parish schoolmaster's living consists of 100 merks Scots,
paid by the heritors and tenants, fees for baptisms, marria-
ges, and school-fees, and may be estimated at L. 11 or L. 12.
For a few months in winter, the number of scholars is
sometimes above 40, but through the spring and summer,
only about a dozen attend the school.  Reading, writing,
and arithmetic, are the only branches taught.  The other
school, which is fixed on the West-water about four com-
puted miles from the former, is kept only during the win-
ter half-year.  This school was first erected about 1750, and
a fund of 500 merks Scots, appointed for supporting a teach-
er, which fund, about two years ago, received an addition
of L. 20 Sterling.

   Poor.-Our number of poor at present is eight.  They
are supplied by our Sabbath-collections, and the interest of
a fund of L. 460, a provision abundantly sufficient to answer
all reasonable demands.  Our weekly collections have been
continuing to rise gradually for some years.  Our funds
being so considerable, we judge it improper to apply for
any of the Government's bounty in 1783.  About 50
years ago, it was common for upwards of 20 young people
belonging to the parishes to go a-begging in the winter-
season for want of employment and support; whereas at
present the farmers find it very difficult to procure either
at home, or from a distance, a sufficiency of young people
to serve them.  There is not a person belonging to these
parishes permitted at present to go a-begging.

   Prices.-The price of an ox, 40 or 50 years ago, was
L. 2, 10; such an ox would now fell at L. 6, 15.  An
old ewe sold formerly at 1 s. 1 d.; such an ewe would now
