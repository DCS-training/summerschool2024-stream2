   Situation and Extent.-Fossaway consists of two branches,
entirely separated from each other by Tulliebole, which in-
tervenes, having one of those branches on the northern, and
the other on the southern side of it.  As the church of Fossa-
way stood on the northern branch, those families, who dwelt
on the southern, were under the necessity of passing either
through Tulliebole, or the parish of Muckart, before they
could come to the place of worship.  This circumstance
seems first to have led to the junction of the two parishes,
and then to the removal of the church and manse, from their
former situation, to the place where they now stand, which
is much more convenient and centrical.  The northern
branch of Fossaway, extends along the Ochil hills, from east
to west, and is about 6 miles in length, and 3 in breadth.
Tulliebole lies on the lower ground, extending from the bot-
tom of the Ochil hills on the north, towards the Cliesh hills
on the south; and from the Crook of Dovan on the west, to
about half way to Kinross on the east.  Its southern side juts
out both to the east and west, nearly an English mile farther
than its northern side.  Cutting off these two corners, the
remaining space will be about 3 miles square.  To the south-
ern side of the parish of Tulliebole, is joined the southern
branch of Fossaway, running in a south-west direction, for
nearly 8 miles in length, and at an average, 2 and a half in
breadth.  The two parishes taken together, do not form a
regular figure; but they are bounded in the following man-
