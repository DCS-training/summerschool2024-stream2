prized of the meeting, marched, the morning of the same
day, from Hamilton with his cavalry.  They were spied
by the watch shortly after they passed Strathaven*, who
ran and informed their brethren of the approach of the e-
nemy.  After prayer, by their minister Mr William Ha-
milton, who acted likewise as commanding officer, they
drew up in order, took their station, and gave the soldiers
a reception very different from what they expected.
Thirty of them were killed:  Captain Graham had his
horse shot under him, and made a very narrow escape.
The Covenanters lost only a few men.  Their horses were
a great incumbrance to the dragoons, the place of action
being almost surrounded with swampy ground.  Had the
Covenanters pursued their advantage, it is believed that
they might have cut the whole party to pieces.  The suc-

muster an army of 8000 men, about three weeks afterward,
at Bothwell bridge, and dispute that passage with the King's
forces, commanded by the Duke of Monmouth.  Here,
however, they were defeated with great daughter, and
1200 of them taken prisoners.  After the battle, the Duke
marched his army into this parish, with the view, as was
apprehended, of revenging the affair of Drumclog.  But
after remaining for a few days, during which the cavalry
ate up most of the grain in the country, the army retired
without doing any mischief.  The men were under good
discipline, and the Duke behaved, in every respect, with a
generosity becoming his high rank.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-This parish is well watered,
and needs only inclosing and shelter to make it an excel-

*Strathaven is 7 miles from Hamilton, and Drumclog between 5 and 6
from Strathaven; so that the dragoons had a march of more than 12 miles
before the engagement.
