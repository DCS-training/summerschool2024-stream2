Edinburgh, having been apprized that measures prejudicial to "the
Kirk and its discipline" were to be resolved on at a meeting of
Parliament appointed to be held in May, prevailed upon David
Lindsay, minister at Leith, who was most acceptable to the
court, to interceds with the king for the interposition of his autho-
rity till the Assembly should be heard in the matter; but, when
he was entering the gate of the palace in discharge of his com-
mission, he was apprehended and carried to Blackness. There,
also, the ministers of Edinburgh were condemned to a temporary
confinement in 1587, for refusing to pray for the Queen's delive-
rance; their refusal being "not simply to pray for her, but for the
preservation of her life, as if she had been innocent of the crimes
laid to her charge." In 1594, the Earl of Angus, one of the ex-
communicated Lords, was required to deliver himself up to cus-
tody in Blackness, till he should undergo a trial, but refusing, was
subsequently with the others found guilty of high treason. From
August 1605 till towards the close of the following year, John
Welsh, minister of Ayr, who had married John Knox's daughter
Elizabeth, along with five other clergymen, were confined in the
castle for refusing to condemn the Assembly that had met a short
time before at Aberdeen, when they were "banished the king's
dominions upon the pain of death." About the same time, a state
prisoner of a different description, Gilbert Brown, abbot of New
Abbey, "a trafficking and seducing Papist," who had been appre-
hended by Lord Cranstoun, was lodged for a few days within its
walls, till he was transported to the castle of Edinburgh. In
1624, William Rigg, one of the bailies of Edinburgh, was de-
prived of his office of magistrate, condemned to be imprisoned in
Blackness Castle, and fined in L.50,000 Scots for challenging the
doctrine taught by the Episcopal clergy. He was charged as being
"the chief ringleader of the non-conformitants in Edinburgh, and
that he contributed liberally to the printing of books which crossed
the course of conformities" The second Lord Bargeny, (John
Hamilton), who was served heir to his father, the first lord, on the
17th October 1662, as the retour in Thomson's Abridgement
bears, "in terris dominicalibus de Carriden, Law, et Dyland, cum
maneriei loco de Carriden, infra baroniam de Carriden," was a
prisoner in the castle in November 1679. In his indictment before
the Court of Justiciary, dated 24th February 1680, he is inter
alia charged with "corresponding with John Welsh," grandson
of the former worthy of the name, "a factious trumpet of sedition
