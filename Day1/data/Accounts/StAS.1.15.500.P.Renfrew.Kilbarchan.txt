come in regular, succession, and not overburden them with
labour at any particular period.  By feeding much in the
house, great quantities of dung would be produced.  Though
potatoes grow here in perfection, and answer well for these
purposes, they never think of giving them to cattle, as they
have a ready market at hand for all they can produce.  In
wet seasons they might plough in wheat and beans, with a
light horse, yoked in a drill plough, when harrows could not
be used.

   Potatoes.-On some spots round the moss formerly de-
scribed, they raise excellent potatoes in narrow lazy beds.
They cover the sets with about eight or ten inches of moss,
dug from the trench early in the season.  When drought
comes on, they set fire to the lazy beds, and the ashes serve
as manure.  In other places, the potatoes are generally plant-
ed and dressed by the plough in drills.

   Manures.-Their dung, accumulated in winter, generally
goes to potatoes, or barley.  They lime upon ley, at the rate
of 3 chalders per acre, valued at 10 s each chalder, and imme-
diately plough it in.  I should think it much better to lime
upon the hay stubble, before they turned the ground into
pasture.  This would yield more than the value of the lime
in pasture, and a greater crop when the lime was broken up.
Some make composts of earth and dung; others make them by
frequently ploughing a high head-rig in Summer, into which
they put lime, and afterwards lay it on the field.  Adjoin-
ing to the moss, they make composts of moss, dung and lime,
which are found to be very beneficial for their strong clay soil.

   Horses and ploughing.-The horses here are of an excellent
breed, both for strength and mettle.  They are mostly pur-
