sandy shore of the Long Island, affording the strongest
proofs, that a wide extent of its western coast, once the ha-
bitation of men, has, either through some violent concussion,
or a gradual process of nature, become the bed of a part of
the Atlantic Ocean.

   Antiquities.-There are several monuments of Druidism,
corresponding to the descriptions of the places of worship
under this old establishment given by antiquarians.  On the
mainland of Harris, in the district within Tarbert, there are
two of the same description within three miles of each other,
one at Nisabost, and the other at Borve.  What now remains
of each of these monuments consists of a long flat stone,
raised on end perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, a-
bout eight feet above the surface of the earth, and surround-
ed by a circle, of smaller stones, placed on edge, of about
10 feet diameter.  The great stone is not quite in the cen-
ter of the circle.  Within a few yards of the one at Borve,
there are clear vestiges of a circular building, which has ei-
ther been a temple adjoining this clachan, or the residence
of the officiating Druids.  One of these monuments, in the
Island of Berneray, is remarkable for its name, and varies a
little from the above description.  The principal stone is
something of a conical figure, placed on the small end and
flat above.  Its height above the surface is not five feet.  The
circle which surrounds it, less in diameter than those already
mentioned, is made up of long sharp pointed stones, laid not
very close together, but so as that a man may pass betwixt
every two.  It is to this day called clach na greine, the stone
of the sun.  It is well known that under Druidism, which
was a corruption of the ancient religion of the Magi, the deity
was worshipped as the essence of fire, and was designed by
the poets Grinaeus Appollo.
