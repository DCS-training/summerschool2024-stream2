fourth of an ounce of silver; some of them are in the pos-
session of Mils Brown in Borland.

   Derivation of Names.-Some names of places here are
said by those who know something of the Saxon, to be de-
rived from that language.  Sceraburn (Skyreburn, the 
name of a burn or small river wich runs through the pa-
rish) signifies Clear Burn; this seems to be descriptive of 
the colour of its water.  Cardoness, derived from Caer a 
sort, Don or Dun a hill, and Ness a point of land jutting 
out into the sea; that is, the fort situated on the hill jutting 
out into the sea.  This is also very descriptive of the situa-
ton of the Castle.  The sea still slows to within a few paces 
of it; and from the banks of shells that are deposited on each 
side of the point of land on which it is built, It appears
that the sea, at no very distant period, washed the rock on
which it now stands.  Some names are said to be derived 
from the Gaelic.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The advantages of this
parish are, its vicinity to the sea, on account of which, lime
and other articles are got with very little land-carriage,
and great quantities of shells lie on the shore, in the lower 
end of the parish, which experience has proved to be well
adapted to the improvement of land.  The great road from
Carlisle to Portpatrick passes through the parish.  The other 
roads in it are judiciously directed, and generally in good re-
pair.  The scarcity of fuel is one disadvantage; peats are not 
plenty; in some places of the parish they must be carried 
4 miles.  The coals used must be brought from Cumberland 
or Ayrshire; the high duty hitherto imposed on which,
rendered them extremely dear, and amounted almost to 
a prohibition against their being used by the middle and 
lower ranks:
