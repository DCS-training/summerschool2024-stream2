mon labourer and his wife may be estimated at L. 11 Ster-
ling yearly:  Many of them have actually brought up
pretty large families upon the wages they receive, and that
without running much in debt.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are no ale-houses, but
plenty of whisky-houses, here, which are rather unfriendly
to the morals of the people.  Twelve new houses have
beer built within these 10 years; for each of these, ex-
cept 3, an old house has been pulled down.  There are al-
most no cottagers employed in agriculture, unless by the
Duke af Argyle.  It is difficult to say whether it is better
to employ them or hired servants.  It is believed, that the
cheapest and most expeditions method of carrying on work
in this part of the country, is letting it by the piece, when
it can be done so.  For these 20 years and upwards, no person
whatever, residing within this parish, has been imprisoned,
except one poor man a short time for a small debt.  Here rats
cannot exist:  Many of these have, at different times, been
accidentally imported from vessels lying upon the shore;
but were never known to live 12 months in the place.
From a prevailing opinion, that the soil of this parish is
hostile to that animal, some years ago, a West India planter
actually carried out to Jamaica several carks of Roseneath
carth, with a view to kill the rats that were destroying his
sugar-canes.  It is said this had not the desired effect; so
we lost a very valuable export.  Had the experiment suc-
ceeded, this would have been a new and profitable trade
for the proprietors; but perhaps, by this time, the parish of
Roseneath might have been no more.
