   Black Cattle and Horses.-The black cattle here are of the
short-horned breed, and from the attention now paid to them,
it is probable, that they will be brought to a great degree of
perfection.  The steers of the belt kind of this breed, when
3 years old, and fat, will weigh from 60 to 75 stone (of 14 1b.
to the stone), and if kept to a proper age, will weigh from 85
to 110 stone; some individuals may even weigh a great deal
more.  It may, perhaps, be proper to mention, that it is not
large sheep and cattle, that the farmers here wish to breed; it is
the small, well shaped, kindly sort, that will raise molt money
in a given time, from a given quantity of grass, turnips, or
other food.  The cows give from 16 to 24 English quarts of
milk in the day; some cows may give a great deal more, but
such are only exceptions from the major part.  When pro-
perly fatted, the cows will weigh from 50 to 80 stone.  There
are, in general, from 250 to 300 black cattle, and from 70
to 90 horses in the parish,

   Fish and Birds, etc.-The river Tweed abounds with sal-
mon, trouts, eels, etc.  The salmon fisheries let here from
50 L. to 100 L. a year; nearer Berwick they increase very much
in value.  The salmon are all sent to the London market,
where they bring great prices.  There is plenty of game, as
partridges, hares, etc.; and in the winter, woodcocks, and
sometimes woodpeckers appear.  In the spring, wild geese
frequent the country.  Goosanders, wigeons, and cormorants,
resort to the Tweed in severe winters, and sometimes grebes,
and speckled divers; and in the lakes there are numbers of
mallards and teals.

   Population.-The inhabitants have increased considerably
within there 40 years.  The return to Dr. Webster in 1755
was only 386.  There are now from 580 to 600.  Two years
