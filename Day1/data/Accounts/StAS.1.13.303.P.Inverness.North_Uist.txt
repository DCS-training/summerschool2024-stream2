mountainous, and almost uninhabited, which gives strangers,
who do not give themselves the trouble of visiting the cul-
tivated parts of the country, a very disagreeable idea
of it.

   Islands.-A league to the northward of North Uist lies
Boreray, a fertile island, a mile and a half long, and half a
mile broad.  It is presently possessed by a gentleman of
the name of Maclean, whose predecessors have been in
possession of it for several generations back, one of whom,
for services done to the family of Macdonald, obtained,
for the small yearly rent of L. 12 Sterling, a very long lease
of it, 57 years of which are to run after the present pos-
sessor's demise.  Between this island and the main land of
North Uist lies Orinsay, an island only at high water half
a mile long, the soil sandy for the most part, but fertile in
favourable seasons.  3 miles westward of the last mentioned
island, but still N. of the main land of North Uist, lies Val-
lay, also an island only at high water, and separated from
the shore, when the tide is out, by a sand 2 miles broad.
It is a mile and a half long, not half a mile broad, the
soil for the most part sandy.  It is beautiful and fertile in
corn and grass, when the summer is rainy, but yields
very little of either when the season is the reverse.  In
the winter and spring it is quite barren, the surface
being covered with sand, which a gale from the N. W.
never fails to blow over it.  2 leagues to the westward
of North Uist lies Heisker, nearly 2 miles in length, but
very narrow.  The soil is sandy, yields very little grass
at any time, and is only valuable on account of its kelp
shores, and a small quantity of grain it produces.  The
islands of Kirkbost and Ileray lie stretched along the W.
coast of North Uist, pretty close to it, and separated
from it, and from one another, by a sand which the sea
overflows at high water.  The former is 1 mile long, but
