   Manufacture.-The Cromarty hempen cloth manufacture
was erected in 1773 by the late proprietor, and several other
country gentlemen, and is now carried on by a company of
merchants in London.  The fabricks, which are chiefly de-

weekly over the country from this manufacture, or 2000 L.
Sterling annually.
