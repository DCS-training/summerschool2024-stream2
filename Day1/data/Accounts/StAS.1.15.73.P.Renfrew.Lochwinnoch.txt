to, which they are particularly attached.  Their houses are
comfortable, many of them extremely good, and the old woods
of plane and ash trees, with which they are universally sur-
rounded, contribute much to the beauty of the country.

   Agriculture, Farm Rents, Produce, etc.-The arable land
of this parish amounts to 5476 acres, of which 1494 are year-
ly in tillage; and it is all enclosed with stone walls, hedges,
or sunk fences, with a hedge planted at a proper distance
from the bottom, which is a very strong and beautiful fence.
The rent of the land is from 12 s. Sterling to 2 L. per acre; and
the farms are generally let for 19 years, at from 15 L. to 110 L.
annually.  A certain proportion of the arable land is likewise
let to the manufacturers in small lots.  The tenants are bound,
by their leases, to plow 2, and rest: 4 years, and to have on-
ly one third of the farm in tillage.  They put their whole
manure on the first year, and lay down the second crop with
rye-grass and clover, which is a considerable improvement,
though it has only become a common practice within these
few years.  Oats, (which are sown in March and reaped in
September,) and potatoes, are the principal crops in this pa-
rish.  Barley, or rather bear, is likewise raised in small quan-
tities; and the culture of flax has been attended with success,
and has entitled many of the farmers to premiums.  From
the nature of the soil, which produces very fine pasture, worth
from 5 s. to 30 s. a great quantity of butter and cheese is an-
nually made; and the farmers principally depend on the sale
of these articles, and the rearing of cattle, to the breed of
which they are particularly attentive.

   Horses, Cattle, Sheep, etc.-The horses are remarkably good,
and the milk cows sell at from 6 L. to 12 L.  The total
number of these, and the other live stock, are as follows:
