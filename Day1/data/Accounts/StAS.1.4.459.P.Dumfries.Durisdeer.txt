   During these last 19 years, 430 have been baptized, 323
have died, and 155 couples have been married.  One per-
son died lately at 95.  And in 1773, died Bessy Famieson,
whose own account of her age was, that she remembered the 
Merk Monday being then a little girl.  This remarkable
Monday is said to have been in the year 1652.  The num-
