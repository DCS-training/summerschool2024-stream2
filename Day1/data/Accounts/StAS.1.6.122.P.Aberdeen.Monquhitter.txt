crops of grain and grass, the toil and expence of the husband-
man.  Large tracts of inferior quality have been improved to
good account by lime and water; but tracts, still more extensive,
of a light moorish soil, being denied by nature a proper degree
of the vegetative principle, or having been reduced, by paring
and burning, to sterility, cannot be reclaimed on a short lease to
any advantage.  It requires no less than 80 bolls of lime to sti-
mulate an acre of new soil.
   Notwithstanding the extent of mossy and swampy ground,
the air of Montquhitter parish is pure and healthful.  These
fogs, called Mildews, though pregnant with mineral exhala-
tions, seem to be more pernicious to the vegetable than to the
animal tribes.  The chin-cough, measles, and small-pox, re-
turn periodically; but the virulence of these disorders is now
greatly lessened by judicious management.  Rheumatism, con-
sumption, and fever, are the diseases which most frequently
prevail: but, perhaps, no parish in the island can be pointed
out where health and longevity are more generally found.

tered by two small rivers, which receive the tribute of number-
less and copious springs.  One of these discharges itself into
the Ythan: and the other, after assuming various names as it
passes along, discharges itself, near Turriff, into the Doveran.
These abound with delicious small trout of the common kind.
During spring and autumn large trout, of a red colour, pay
us a visit; but, when these strangers have obeyed the impulse
of the season, they again return to the nobler streams.  The
trout, however, being much injured by the net, by the parti-
cles of lime washed from our fields, and by the essence of steep-
ed flax, are daily decreasing in number.
   Below a stratum of pebbly clay, extensive quarries of red
freestone lie in the direction of a plane, much inclined from
