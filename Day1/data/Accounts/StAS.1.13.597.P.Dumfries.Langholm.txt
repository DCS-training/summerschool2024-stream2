traveller as he passes through these enchanting groves.

mitian, all in excellent preservation.  They are now in
the possession of Lady Douglas of Douglas.  Upon the same

in the possession of the family of the late Mr. Little, baron-
bailie of Langholm.  At the confluence of the Esk and
the Ewes stands a small fragment of Langholm Castle, for-
