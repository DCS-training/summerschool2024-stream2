     of Symington.

woollen or cotton manufacturers, to settle here, the plea-
santness of the situation, the purity of the air, the excel-
lence of the water, the goodness of the roads, the nearness
of coal, and the vicinity of Symington to so many mar-
ket towns, would render it a most eligible place.  Were
such branches carried on to any considerable extent, the
property around would be rendered still more valuable,
and old and young, who could work, might be profitably
employed.  There are 2 corn mills in the parish, where
when supplied with water, (which fails in frost or drought),
the best oat-meal in the country is made; but this ad-
vantage is clogged with a material disadvantage.  Many
of the tenants are restricted to a heavy thirlage, which is
a pernicious check on agriculture, and is a species of vas-
sallage, that ought to be abolished in every civilized and
improving country.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are only two houses
where ale and British spirits are sold; one in the village,
which is not much frequented; and the other by the side
of the public road, where the weary traveller may find
refreshment.-No person belonging to the parish, has been
judicially impeached or convicted of any crime, in the
memory of the oldest inhabitant, except one unfortunate
woman, who was banished many years ago.
