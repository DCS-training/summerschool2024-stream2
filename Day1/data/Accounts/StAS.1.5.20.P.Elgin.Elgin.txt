planted over, and as often failed, from its northern exposure,
the neighbourhood of the sea, and a sterile soil.  A sagacious
country gardener raised a nursery on the most exposed place of
this plantation, from which he took the plants, and they
throve well.  By this mode, were it uniformly adopted, plan-
tations might be raised, even within the reach of the sea spray,
or on any exposure, the plants being habituated, in early life,
to their situation.  There is moss, in many parts of Scotland,
at flood-marked; and, in North America, trees grow within
the reach of spring tides.
   It may not be improper, to conclude this paper, with some
observations on the causes of depopulation, in some parts of
Scotland, by which this district in particular seems to be
distinguished.
   1.  Our standing armies, from dissipation and other causes
are hostile to marriage, and the rearing of children; nor
are the children produced, in general, either healthy or
long lived.  A great navy, and multitudes of sailors em-
ployed in foreign commerce, must have the same effect.
   2.  Increase of manufactures.  It is allowed, that where
manufacturing families are scattered over a country, and
each of them has a few acres of land, in the culture of
which they are occasionally employed, a numerous and
healthy breed is the necessary consequence.  But when num-
bers are cooped up, in ill-aired, low, damp houses, neither the
parents, nor the children are healthy.  Besides, a sedentary,
and confined situation, is adverse to longevity, and to a healthy
progeny.
   3. Sheep farms in the Highlands of Scotland, and in other
places, have obliged numbers to emigrate; and when once a
country becomes depupolated, by the removal of it's native
inhabitants, it requires ages to recruit them.
   4. In the Lowlands, the spirit of the times, has introduced
a system, of converting many small, into one large farm.
