     of Kildonatt.

   Church and Schools.-The Countess of Sutherland is patron.
The minister's stipend is paid, partly in victual belonging to
the parish of Loth, viz. 40 bolls;-(32 bolls bear, and 8 bolls
oat meal;) and partly in cash, the money stipend being 30 L.
10 s. 1 5/12 d. amounting in all to 50 L. Sterling.  The church
was built in 1786, and the manse in 1766; it became very
ruinous since, and is repairing this season.  There are two
schools established in this parish, for the instruction of youth,
a parochial school, and a Society school; the master of the
former has only 100 merks Scotch, common quarter fees,
from such scholars as can afford them, and 1 1.5 s. from the
kirk-session, as session clerk and precentor.  The number of
the scholars is very few during the busy seasons; but in win-
ter, he has upwards of 30.  The Society school, when last
visited, had rather more.  The master's salary is 9 L. Ster-
ling.  He receives few payments from the scholars, as they
are in general very poor.

   Antiquities.-In Suinachugh, or Kinbrace, 4 miles above
the church of Kildonan, a battle was fought about the mid-
dle of the 12th century, between two chieftains, originally
of Danish extraction, named Suenus and Aulver Rost,
Tradition informs us, that, from the number of large cairns
which surround the town, and are called Cairn-Sum, or Old
Cairns, the town itself was named Suinachugh, or Old Field:
But the Danish historian, Torsaeus, who relates the story of
the battle between Suenus and Aulver Rosta, seems to give a 
better account of the etymology of the name, in the 23d
and 26th chapters of the first book of his History of the Ork-
neys; from which it is more than probable, that it was ori-
ginally called Suenus Field.  There are 3 subterraneous pas-
sages, or tumuli, in this parish, which, it is said, lead from
one cairn, under the bed of the river of Helmsdale, to an-
