scription school for the poorer classes in the town, which has been
very ably conducted by Mr Lennox, a greater desire for the in-
struction of their children has sprung up among, the Irish popu-
lation, which promises to be attended with the happiest results.
	Literature.--There are subscription and circulating libraries in
the town, and in the villages of Dunure and Calroy; and the
parish school and Sabbath evening schools have small libraries
attached to them.
	Charitable and other Institutions--Friendly Societies. The
following list will show that a number of these important societies
still exist; many have been dissolved, and several are rather in a
declining state. They have been of the very greatest advantage,
and have enabled many families to maintain their independence in
seasons of distress; and it is to be regretted that erroneous calcu-
lations at the first, and too liberal application of the funds at par-
ticular conjunctures, should have shaken their stability and im-
paired their usefulness:--Love and Unity, instituted in 1796, has
of capital, L. 54; Philanthropic, instituted in 1808, capital, L. 120;
Caledonian, sixty-six members, instituted in 1818, capital, L. 140;
Social and Humane, instituted in 1825, capital, L. 84; Albion,
sixty-six members, instituted in 1820, capital, L. 83; Benevolent
Love and Unity Female, instituted in 1829; Friendly Female,
instituted in 1810, capital, L. 25.
	Saving Banks.--There was instituted in 1831, a savings bank
for Maybole and the adjacent villages, which has continued to,
prosper to the present date, but it is much to be regretted that so
few, especially of the hand loom weavers, should have availed them-
selves of its provisions. The following summary furnished by
Mr Brown, the banker, will show the progress and state of the
institution.
