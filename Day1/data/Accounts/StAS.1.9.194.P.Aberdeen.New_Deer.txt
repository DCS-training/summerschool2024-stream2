     Statistical Account

here, many parishioners are carried to neighbouring burying
grounds, and many are not registered at all, in consequence
of the duty not being paid; and marriages are registered
only when the bride resides in the parish.  The present
number of inhabitants, at a moderate calculation, is one-
third greater than it was 30 or 40 years ago.  This increase
is to be ascribed to the parcelling out of large farms, and
the abundance of moss and lime.  The number of ploughs
is about 230, of old ploughgates 80, of horses 712, of
cattle 3200, and of sheep there may be from 1300 to 1400.
Small farms, rent from L. 5 to L. 10; middle-sized farms
from L. 10 to L. 20; large farms from L. 30 to L. 40:
there is one at L. 50, and another about L. 80.  A general
measurement of the parish has never been made; nor
can it be precisely stated what is the rent the acre.  Where
surveyors have been employed, they have usually rated
the outfield at 6 s. and the infield at 12 s.; but the infield
now generally lets from 12 s. to 18 s. or 20 s. and the out-
field nearly in proportion.

   Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-The present stipend is 600
merks Scots, 4 chalders of meal, and L. 5 Sterling for
communion-elements.  The glebe, including manse and
offices, etc. is scarcely 4 acres and a half.  The Crown is
patron.  The age of the present incumbent is 86, and who
has been minister for 56 years.-There is a very good
school-house; the number of scholars, at an average through
the year, is between 30 and 40.  The schoolmaster's sala-
ry is about L. 4 Sterling.  This, with 30 s. as session-clerk,
school-fees, and some other small perquisites, may amount
to L. 12 yearly, which is all his emolument.-The num-
ber of poor on the roll is 60 and upwards.  The annual
amount of the funds for their relief, arising from the week-
ly collections, interest of money, etc. is about L. 50.  This,
