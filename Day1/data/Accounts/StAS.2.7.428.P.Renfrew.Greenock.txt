              Taking the population at 27,571, the average number in each
            family is 43/5 1/3 5/5 9/3; but adding seaman and others not at home at the
            time of the census, and making the whole population 29,571, the
            average number is 44/5 1/3 5/5 9/3
              Looking to the first of the tables which have now been given,
            the reader can searcely fail to observe the great inequality of the
            sexes in point of numbers.  Even when we add the absent sea-
            men, the disproportion is considerable.  In 1811 , there was, with
            this addition, an excess of females amounting to 1086.  In 1821,
            the excess with this addition was 1326; and in 1831, there was a
            sililar excess, amounting to 1625.  The disparity is occasioned
            chiefly by the casualties inseparable from a sea-faring life.  The
            inequality, however, is not so great as in some manufacturing towns.
            Paisley may be taken as an example.  In I801, there were in that
            town, and in part of the Abbey parish adjoining, 14,413 males,
            and 16,766 females, the disparity amounting to 2353.  In 1811,
            there were 16,457 males, and 20,265 females, or an excess of fe-
            males of 3808./f* From this comparative statement, it appears
            that the disproportion between the sexes, occasioned by the un-
            healthful occupations, and the vices of a manufacturing town, is
            considerably greater than in the sea-port town of Greenock.
             About 600 of the whole population reside in the landward or
            country part of the parish, and in villages so small as to be scarcely
            worthy of the name; the remainder in the towns of Greenock and
            Crawfurdsdike.  Both in town and country, there are a considera-
            ble number of persons upwards of seventy.  A short time ago, a
            person belonging to the town of Greenock died in his hundredth
            and fourth year.  His name was John Shannon.  He was a nathve
            of Campbelltown, but spent the latter part of his life in Greenock,
            pursuing at different periods the occupations of pilot and fisherman.
            He was a remarkably hale stout old man, and when past his hun-
            dredth year, walked with ease upwards of two miles in a forenoon,
            the wind blowing a hurricane.  It is scarcely necessary to add,
            that he was an object of considerable interest to those who knew
            him, and a great favourite with many of them,  He continued in
            full possession of all his raculties till a short time before his
            death.
               character of the People.-Tbe population consists of persons
            of very different degrees of wealth, and of very different habits


            <FOOTNOTE>It is singular fact, that the disproportion is less by census 1821 and 1831.
