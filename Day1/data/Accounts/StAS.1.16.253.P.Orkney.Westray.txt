oats is in the month of March, and sometimes they sow
this grain in the end of February, if the season is favour-
able.  The only manure here is sea-weed or ware, with
the help of what house-dung they can produce.  The sea-
weed is no doubt a very rich and productive manure, but
is of little use to the ground but for the present crop.
This they lay on the fields which had produced oats the pre-
ceding season, and this is done immediately after harvest,
and during the winter, as often as the wind and tides bring
this manure ashore.  In the spring season, after the oats are
sown, the farmer gives the wared land one ploughing,
which they call their fallow.  Sometimes, when the ware
does not come ashore in the winter season, it comes at the
time of their fallow, which obliges the farmer to put it on
the land immediately from the strand.  This manure does
not answer so well for most soils as the winter ware, yet
it generally answers pretty well.  When the ware here is
got in the proper season, it is carried up from the strand,
and laid in heaps on the banks, and there it is allowed to
lie till it acquires a considerable degree of heat or fermen-
tation; this is reckoned a good preparation for this kind of
manure, and in this way is most productive.  There is a
variety of soils in this parish, and they differ very much from
one another in the same corner.  There is a good deal of
the land composed of a rich black mould; some again con-
sisting of black mould with a mixture of sand; in other
parts, clay mixed with sand; in some places, black mould
mixed with peat moss; and finally, there is much land
consisting of nothing but pure sand; when plenty of good
ware is laid on such soil as this, it will yield a tolerable
crop.  The ground here is generally of a free and light
nature, and cannot bear much labouring.  The farmer gives
the bear land one ploughing only after the fallow, at the
time he sows the seed, the soil being so light and free, it
