   Earthquakes.-This parish, and the neighbourhood, have,
for more than 3 years past, been not a little alarmed by
several smart shocks of an earthquake.  It was first felt,
or rather loud noises, unaccompanied with any concussion,
were heard by the inhabitants of Glenlednaig, during autumn
1789.  There noises were first supposed to be peals of thun-
der; afterwards, as they were heard sometimes when the sky
was quite clear, the people imagined they were occasioned by
the firing of the carronades at Dunira.  Finding, however, on
inquiry, that they did not proceed from this cause, they were
at a loss how to account for them, till the 5th of November
1789, When, about 6 o'clock in the evening, they were alarm-
ed by a loud rumbling noise, accompanied with a severe shock
of an earthquake.  This shock, which is generally supposed to
be the most violent of any that has happened here, was very
sensibly felt over a tract of country of more than 20 miles in
extent.  Since that period the shocks have been very frequent,
and at times pretty violent; but hitherto they have done no
harm.  Within these 3 or 4 weeks, since the weather has
settled into drought, they have ceased altogether.  The cen-
tre of the earthquake is, as nearly as can be guessed, about
the mouth of Glenlednaig, a mile or two north from the vil-
lage of Comrie.  What supports this conjecture is, that the
people who live on the E. side of the glen, feel the earth-
quake begin in the N. W., and proceed in a south-easterly
direction: Those again who inhabit the country on the W.
side of it, think it takes its rise in the N. E., and expires in
the W.
