blooming.  The average temperature in January 1823 was only
28.5.
   From observations regularly made by Alexander Bald, Esq. at
Craigward Cottage, with a well-regulated thermometer at a north
exposure, at 10 A. M. every day, from June 1837, it appears that
the average temperature for the last six months of 1837, was
50 3/5/d that of the whole of 1838, 44 1/2&deg;; and for the whole of
1839, 45 2/3 1/0&deg;. The average temperature of each month in 1838
and 1839 was as under:-

   The most generally prevailing winds, as well as storms, are from
the south-west; and, although they frequently bring rain, they are
always accompanied by a mild temperature. The least frequent
are from the north and north-west. The wind frequently blows
from the east and north-east for some time in the spring, when it is
usually dry and cold,-the westerly winds being generally mild
and rainy. Considerably less rain falls here than on the high,
grounds towards the east and west, or in the more immediate
neighbourhood of the Ochil hills, which are believed to attract
and carry away the clouds from the vale of the Forth.
  The quantity of rain that fell here during 1838 and 1839, has
been ascertained by a rain-gauge kept in Mr Bald's garden at                                                       rden at
Craigward Cottage, which is elevated only a few yards above the
level of the Forth, and is as under:-
