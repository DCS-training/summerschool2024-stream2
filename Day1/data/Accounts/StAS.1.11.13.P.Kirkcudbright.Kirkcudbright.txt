     of Kirkcudbright.

   Light-House proposed.-In stormy weather, when vessels
can neither keep the sea, nor clear the land, this harbour is
the belt in the S. coast of Scotland for shelter, and on that
account is much frequented in winter.  But the entrance in-
to it being narrow, a strong tide setting right across, and no
light-house to direct them, it is dangerous to run for it in
the dark, and engage with a lee shore.  Many fatal accidents
happen by ships missing the harbour, and being driven, either
into Wigton Bay, or on the banks of the Solway Frith.  The
island, of Litsie Ross affords an excellent situation for a light-
house.  One might be erected there at a small expence, and
kept up on moderate terms.  It would be of the outmost uti-
lity to all shipping, and particularly to strangers, in the hour
of danger.  Were government apprised of the great benefit
that would result from this, it is to be hoped they would
think the matter worthy their attention, and cause a light-
house to be erected at the public expence.

   Sea Ware.-The harbour furnishes dilse, tangle, and com-
mon sea-weed.  A considerable quantity of the latter is cut,
made into kelp, and sold for the soap and bottle manufactories.

   Sea Fish and Fowls.-Besides salmon, sea-trouts and hirlines,
the following sea fish are to be found in the harbour: cod,
which are sold at 1 1/2 d. per pound; sead, called here lyth or
lyd; blochan, mackerels, whitings, flounders, soles,skate, eels,
sand-eels, clubbocks, or codlocks; shrimps; lesser spotted sharks,
called here dog-fish; angel sharks*; bull's heads, or miller's
thumbs; porpoises, and herrings+.  The shell fish are, rock

*One of these, taken last summer, measured 5 feet in length.

+The great number of herring fry found in this harbour, afford a
presumption, that herrings are on the coast in the proper season; but they pass
totally neglected.
