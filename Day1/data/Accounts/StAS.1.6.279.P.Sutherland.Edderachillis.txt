which is not above 60 yards broad, though it widens greatly
above, and branches out into two considerable kyles,  or lochs,
much frequented by herrings: it is also broad below this place,
and incloses a green island, called Stirks-island; near which is
good anchoring ground for shipping.  This kyle runs up into
the land 5 or 6 miles.-Caohs-Luissard, or, as it is pronoun-
ced in the anglisied way, Laxford, is a name compounded of
two Celtic words, Lun and ard; epithes given it, and  to the
river which runs into the head of it from Lochstack, from the
rapid and high course of that stream.-But, though these
two kyles comprehend the country called Edderachylis, the
parish extends a great way father north, and includes also the
Davoch of Ashir, which is a country of itself, intersected by
a considerable kyle, called Caolis-Inchard, 2 miles long, of-
ten visited by shoals of herrings; and it separates that very
rugged piece of ground, called Kirru-garbh or "rugged quar-
ter" from the north parts  of Ashir, which are the best por-

nis and aird, signifying "high meadow," because of the high
and rich pasture grounds, lying on each side of the kyle, and
of the river, which runs into the head of it, and which go
both by the same name.-As for the name of this part of
the parish, which the natives turn in English, Alshires, and
sometimes more improperly Oldshoars, in Celtic, it is Ashir,
or, which is its real meaning, Tir-fis; a designation relative
to that more fruitful and cultivated place, of which it was
once a part, called Diurness, for it was the Fair-ber of old,
or "waste pasture grounds," belonging to the antient inhabi-
tants of Diurness.
   The parish is bounded on the W. by the Atlantic ocean,
and on the N. by the North Sea, to Cape Wrath, that terror
to mariners, which stands at the head of the line separa-
