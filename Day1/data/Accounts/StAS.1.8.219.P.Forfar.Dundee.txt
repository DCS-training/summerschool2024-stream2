importance to the community, no particular account has been
obtained.
   Besides there, and some other branches of manufacture,
omitted as being yet in their infancy, (for example, cast iron
and fast,) or though long established, sufficiently accounted for
by the taxes they pay to Government, 2 banking companies
are established in Dundee; and two distant companies, one in
Edinburgh, and one in Paisley; have opened bank offices.  The
quantity of paper money, in constant circulation from all the
four, is estimated at 160,00 L.  Insurances against fire are al-
so made by a company, consisting of 50 or 60 persons, whole
property is supposed to amount to half a million; and by
whom, though formed into a company only a few years a-
go, insurances are already made to the value of 800,000 L.

arising from Dundee to Government, may be accurately or
nearly ascertained, but a much more considerable part must

   Of the first kind are the duties of excise for the year,
ending with the 5th of July 1792, and communicated in

they are accompanied with a comparative flare of the excise
duties in 1751.
