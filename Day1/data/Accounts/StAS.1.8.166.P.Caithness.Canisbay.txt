ing a little eastward of Dungisbay Head, the island of Suroma
lying about two leagues to the west.  The parts of the frith,
most dangerous to navigation, are two currents, stretching from
Dungisbay Head and St. John's Head, to a considerable dis-
tance from land.  The former is called the Boars of Dundis-
bay, and the latter the Main of Mey.  The billows in them
are often swollen to a monstrous size, even in the finest sum-
mer day.  They seem to arise from the collision of tides in
opposite directions, and recoiling with increased impetuosity
from the head lands above mentioned.-Without the aid of skil-
ful pilotage, they are hazardous even in the calmest weather.
The tides in every part of the frith are various and irregular,
and of course the navigation dangerous, especially in the
night, where a very small deviation from the proper course
may be attended with fatal consequences.

   A Light-House Proposed.-For the above reasons, and many
more that might be advanced, there is not, around the island
of Britain, a station where a light-house is more requisite,
than in the mouth of the Pentland Frith.  A year does not pass,
without some fatal accidents to shipping, from the want of it.
Either Dungisbay Head, or the largest of the Pentland Sker-
ties, is the station where a light-house ought to be erected.
A light on the Head would serve to illuminate the Pentland
Frith to the west, and the German Ocean to the east, as par
as the eye could discern it.  No doubt its altitude in foggy
weather is an argument, against it, as a station for a light
house; but, from the prevalence of winds in this quar-
ter of the world, fogs would very rarely obstruct the
light.  The Skerry also, would unquestionably be, in many
respects, an excellent station.  It is east of the Head, and of
every part of the coast.  From its local situation, it would
probably yield, as sure a guidance to shipping, as could be
