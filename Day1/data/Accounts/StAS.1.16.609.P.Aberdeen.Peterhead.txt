potatoes brought to this town were imported from Ireland;
that in that year some were brought from Strichen, about 14
or 15 miles from this place, probably from Lord Strichen's
farm; that 60 years ago there were no carts in the town
or parish.
   From an anonymous manuscript, which appears to de-
serve some regard, I find there were only six ships belong-
ing to this town in 1727.  At present; there are 26, and
2 ready to be launched.  Some are employed in the fo-

are from 40 to 200 tons, and will amount nearly to 3000
tons dead weight.  This is more than double the shipping

a town of great opulence.
   It is only of late that the trade of this town has been

and manufactures.  Much remains still to be done; but
from the exertions that have been made, and still continue

   Formery there was too much connexion with an illicit
trade from Gottenburgh and Holland, that has now almost
ceased.
   The fish on this coast are all caught by boats.  I have
often been surprised attempts are not made to carry on this

summer.  Ships are sent every season; and I believe, du-
ring the greatest part of the year from London, who supply
the market there with live cod and flat fish, which they
catch in the Pentland frith; in that neighbourhood, or on
this coast.  There are two, sometimes three vessels, sent to
fish at Barrahead; they carry out 16 fishermen each, and
the average cargoes of each vessel are from 12 to 14 tons of
dried cod and ling, besides the oil from fun-fish which they
