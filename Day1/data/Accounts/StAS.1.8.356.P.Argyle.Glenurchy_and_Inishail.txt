and to their labours.  In most parishes, though it is by no
means the care in this, the winnings of a common servant
greatly exceed the income of men, whole employments ex-
pose them to much waste of health and spirits; to much hunger
and cold, and to much censure; men too, many of them possessed
of learning and cultivated minds, and by means of whom, the
first principles of morals and of science are communicated to
millions.  Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON, Dr, BEATTLE of Aberdeen,
and the learned Mr WALTER RUDDIMAN, with many others
of the most distinguished characters, in the liberal professions,
once earned their poor pittance of support, in such employ-
ments*.

   There is a school for teaching girls sewing, etc. established
also in the country, by the honourable Society for Propagating
Christian Knowledge, with a competent salary:  and there is
another small school in the parish of Inishail, very poorly en-
dowed, though the assessment on the valued rent, to form a sa-
lary, is more than common in such cases.  Although we are
a peaceful people, fencing matters come occasionally to the
bounds, to instruct us in the art of defence:  and masters of
manners also do us the favour, from time to time, to teach
us "the graces-the graces+."

   Poor.-The poor in this united charge are numerous;
amounting at times, to 60:  and many of them, the aged, the
fatherless, the widow, and the bed-ridden.  Besides occasional
supplies, there is a fluted summer and winter distribution, to
the amount of 24 L. or 26 L. a year.  This rum arises from
1600 L. of mortified money; from the collections at church,
and from small fines imposed for immoralities in the parish.
