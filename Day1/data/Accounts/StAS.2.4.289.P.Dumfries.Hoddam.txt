			PARISH OF HODDAM.

		PRESBYTERY OF ANNAN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name, Boundaries, &c.--THE present parish of Hoddam com-
prehends the parishes of Hoddam, Luce, and Ecclefechan, which
were thrown into one in the year 1609. In the charters of the
twelfth century, we find the name spelt Hodholm and Hodolm, the
Anglo-Saxon word for the head of the holm. This is very character-
istic of the situation of the old parish of Hoddam, which lay along
the east bank of the river Annan, at a point where the land is flat and
rich, and in every respect a holm. Luce was situated below this,
on the oopposite side of the river Mein. It is supposed to have de-
rived its name from the luxuriance of its herbage, the British word
llys, and the Scoto-Irish word lus signifying herbs, weeds, &c.
Ecclefechan is supposed to have derived its name from the Latin
word ecclesia, and an Irish abbot called Fechan, who is said to have
lived in this quarter somewhere about the seventh century. For-
merly it used to be spelt Eglisfechan; and in a manuscript account
of Dumfries-shire (in the Advocates' Library) it is called Ecclesia
Fechanis. Each of these parishes in former times was furnished
with a church, but scarcely any thing but the respective cemeteries
now remains. When the three parishes were united, an entirely
new church was erected in a central situation. That, however, was
taken down about sixteen years ago, and a more substantial struc-
ture substituted in its place.
	The present parish is bounded on the north by Tundergarth and
St. Mungo, on the east by Middlebie, on the south by Annan, and
on the west by Cummertrees. Its form is somewhat quadrangular,
and its extent is in length about five miles, in breadth about three
and a-half, and in square miles eleven and a quarter.
