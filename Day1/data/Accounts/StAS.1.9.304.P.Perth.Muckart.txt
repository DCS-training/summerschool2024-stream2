of 60 feet above the level of the sea, produces very good
oats, barley, and peace.  The middle and east part, which
is between 500 and 600 feet above the level of the sea,
produces the same kinds of grain, but of a much inferior
quality.  There have been of late several trials made of
sowing wheat in the parish, which have succeeded indiffe-
rently well in the west part of it; but in the east part, the
ground is too high, light and silly for it.  Almost the
whole soil, being sandy and dry, is well adopted for the cul-
ture of potatoes and turnip, though hitherto few of the last
have been in use to be sown.  They now begin to be some-
what more frequently raised than formerly.  The climate,
in general, is sharp and cold, owing to the highness of the
situation; but it is more mild and temperate in the west
part of the parish, where the ground lies low, than in the
east part of it, where it is high.  The difference is percep-
tible at all seasons of the year, but especially in winter, in
times of frost and snow.-As the parish lies along the foot
of the Ochils, it is frequently covered with fogs and mists,
owing to its vicinity to these hills; and to the same cause,
it is perhaps more subject to rains, than places at a greater
distance from the hills.  The inhabitants, however, are re-
markably healthy, and a considerable proportion of them
live to an advanced age.  There is at present one woman,
aged 88; and there were lately living in one house, at the
same time, a husband, his wife, and his sister, all above 84.
No local distempers are prevalent.  Rheumatism seems to
be more common than any other.

there is a part of the ridge of the Ochils in the parish.
The one at the back of the kirk called Sea male, is about
1350 feet above the level of the sea; but it does not seem
to be of so great a height, owing to its arising from an ele-
