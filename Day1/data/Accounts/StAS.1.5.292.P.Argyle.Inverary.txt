     Statistical Account

French merchants used to come and barter their wines for
herrings, as there is a point of land about 3 miles south of
Inveraray, still called the Frenchman's point; and the tradi-
tion of the country is, that it was to that particular spot
the herrings were in use to be brough, in order to be cured
and sold.  The herring fishing commonly begins in the
month of July, and has been known to continue till the first
of January.  In some years, when herrings came in a con-
siderable body, there have been at least 500 boats employed
in catching them, each boat having 4 men at an average.
From the best information, it is beleived, there have been
caught and cured in some seasons 20,000 barrels, valued then
at 15 s. per barrel.  Lochsyne is also famous for haddocks,
whitings, cod, etc. and is well adapted for fishing, having a
clean bottom and no banks or hidden rocks.  Its depth may
be from from 50 to 100 fathoms.

   Fossils.-The only remarkable fossil in this parish is the
stone, of which a great part of the castle is built, which is
taken from a quarry about 4 miles south of Inveraray.  It
is of a blue colour and ranked under the micaceous class of
stones.  There is likewise a quarry of grey clouded marble,
a mile north of Inveraray, out of which some considerable
blocks have been taken, but of a middling quality.

   Population.-The population of the parish of Inveraray,
has considerably decreased within these 40 years.  The cause
of this decrease is principally owing to the last enumeration,
sent to Dr Webster, having been made up, about the time
when the castle of Inveraray was finishinng, which requitrd
a great number of hands, that became no longer necessary,
when it was completed.  The following table, exhibits its
present state, as accurately as could possibly be ascertained.
