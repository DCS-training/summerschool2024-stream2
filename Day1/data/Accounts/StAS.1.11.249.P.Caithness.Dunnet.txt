     of Dunnet.

   Fish.-Dunnet Bay affords excellent flounders, and haddocks;
and is sometimes frequented by shoals of herrings, in July and
August.  But their continuance in the bay, or even their coming
to it, has hitherto been reckoned so uncertain, that no ex-
tensive herring fishery has been attempted.  Besides these,
great quantities of cuddins, as they are called here, or small
faiths, are usually caught in the summer season.  Pentland
Frith abounds with excellent cod and liog; not of a very
large size, but remarkably thick and of a good quality.  The
haddocks and slounders are taken with small lines, mounted
with 5 or 6 score of hooks, which arc set, and left in the sea
commonly through the night.  The cuddens are taken with a
rod and line, to which is fixed a single hook, and for the most
part in shallow water, or near the shore.  The cod and ling
are found principally in deep water, in the tide way, and taken
with a line of 50 or 60 fathoms, to which a single hook is fixed,
and a lead weight or sinker.  There are various other kinds
of fish occasionally taken, as turbot, skate, whitings, &c.  In
harvest, too, amazing shoals of small fish, called sellacks (which
are no other than the young of saiths, and some species of the
cod), frequent the shores, and are often taken in a small
sweep net, to the quantity of several bushels at once.  There
are scarcely any shell fish to be found here, but lobsters, crabs,
and limpets.

   Birds.-A great variety of sea sowls frequent the rocks of
Dunnet Head; though, as the highest rocks front the W.
and N. W., they are not so numerous as they would other-
wise probably be.  There is a bird, called a layer, here, that
hatches in some parts of the rock.  It is reported, that it is
only to be found in Dunnet Head, Hoy Head in Orkney, in
Wales, and in the Cliffs of Dover (where it is said to be known
by the name of the puffin), and in no other,place in Britain.
