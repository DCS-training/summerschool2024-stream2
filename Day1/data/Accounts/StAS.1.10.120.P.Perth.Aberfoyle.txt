red game, the lower grounds with partridges and snipes.
Wild pigeons are also frequent.  The wood-pecker is some-
times seen, but rarely.

   Soil and Climate.-The soil, having been formed, for the
most part, by the sediment deposited by the streams descend-
ing from the mountains, is light and quick.  It is generally
remarked, that the harvest is earlier in Aberfoyle than any
where in the vicinity towards the south, where the flat coun-
try begins.
   The air is sharp and healthy.  This neighbourhood is sel-
dom visited by any epidemical disorders.  Fevers are the
most frequent diseases; they are to be attributed to the na-
tives being much exposed to getting wet, in a climate where,
from the mountainous nature of the country, rains are fre-
quent.

   Population.-About the year 1770, almost all the upper
part of this parish was converted into sheep farms, for which
the nature of the soil is peculiarly adapted.  Since that peri-
od, the population of this parish has been, no doubt, consi-
derably diminished, but in what proportion, it is not now
easy to ascertain.
   With regard to the first of the following tables, exhibiting
the present population of the parish, it is to be observed, that
it was made up with all possible accuracy in 1790.  Within
these two years, however, several families of cottagers have
emigrated to Balsron, a thriving village about 8 miles distant,
where a cotton manufactory is carried on upon an extensive
scale.
   With regard to the second table of marriages, births, and
deaths, several difficulties have occurred, some of which it is
now impossible altogether to obviate.
