there being plenty of soft running water all around it.
There are a distillery and brewery, lately established in it,
and both are in a thriving way.

   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's eport, the
number of fouls then was 1603.  In 1785, the inhabitants of
the town were in number 775, and those of the country part
of the parish 758, amounting in all to 1553.  In 1792 3, the
town contained 783, the country 707, in all 1490, of whom
728 are males, 762 females.  They are in general of the E-
stablished religion, a few Seceders, Episcopalians, and Qua-
kers, excepted.  The decrease of inhabitants in the country
part of the parish is to be accounted for by the size of the
farms being of late increased, one tenant just now posses-
sing what was formerly occupied by 3 or 4 tenant; and
also by an improving tenant choosing rather to occupy the
ground himself than to let it to subtenants.  The marriages
are, upon an average of 10 years backward, 10, and the
births 26.  There is no register kept of burials.

   Stipend, Church, Poor, School, etc.- The stipend is L. 45
in money, 3 chalders of victual, the one half meal, the o-
ther barley.  The glebe measures between 8 and 9 acres.
The manse and church were lately repaired.  Mr Urquhart 
of Meldrum is proprietor of the whole parish, and patron.
-The number of poor receiving alms is 30; the annual
contribution for their relief amounts, at an average, to a-
bout L. 33, 10 s. which, with some donations sent from
time to time by natives of the place at a distance, make
the whole of the fund for their support.  The greater part
of the poor reside in the town, and the Inhabitants in ge-
neral are very humane and charitable to them, sending of-
ten to their houses what their necessities call for; and they
have also at times public contributions through the town
