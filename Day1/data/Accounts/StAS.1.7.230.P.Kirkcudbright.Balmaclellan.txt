This was the neglect of former times.  But a different cause,
in future, is likely to operate to the same effect, an act of
Parliament, passed in the sessions of 1783, imposing a tax of
3 d. on every birth, burial, Christening, and marriage.  This
tax, trisling in itself, has been viewed by the lower people
with a degree of jea1ousy very disproportioned to its object.
Perhaps the lowness of the tax in question is the chief reason
why it cannot be enforced.  However this be, the above
mentioned act of Parliament has put an end to the registers
in most of the parishes of this neighbourhood.  The people
refuse to pay.  The clerk who would act under the act of
Parliament, besides taking out a licence at 5 s. is bound, un-

name entered on the register; a penalty of 50 L being also
imposed on any person who shall presume to keep a parochial
register without complying with the above conditions.  So
that in a parish like this, where the whole duties to Govern-
ment would not amount to more than 4 s. 6 d. or 5 s. yearly,
through the refractoriness of individuals, and apprehension
of penalty, the parish at large is deprived of a record which
might one day be necessary for proving their propinquity, or
securing their claims.

yearly to about 9 L Sterling.  This is wholly collected from
the people at the church-doors, there being no assessment in
the parish, and the non-residing heritors contributing seldom
any thing to the relief of the poor.  There is also a small
fund of former savings, amounting to between 60 L and 70 L
lying at interest in different hands.
   The stated poor are few, at present amounting to but about
four or five persons.  They are mostly able still to earn the
greater part of their own subsistence.But there are several
