ving the best vegetative powers.  Neither did it follow, be-
cause the grain sprung readily when put into a pot of earth,
that therefore it might be depended on for good seed.  It
was often found to spring readily through the ground,
without having strength enough to bring the plant to matu-
rity.  These remarks are confined to oats.  As to bear or
bigg, when it is hurt by frost, it is always believed to have
an external appearance of being damaged.  The upper end
of the grain is blackened, which is owing, perhaps, to the
husks being more tender and more susceptible of impression
than oats.  By attending to this diversity in the hulk of bear
and oats, the incumbent was led to think, that though the
hardness of the latter prevented any external appearance in
its natural state, when the grain was injured by frost, yet
when stripped of the husk, this appearance might be ob-
served.  Accordingly, after a narrow inspection of different
specimens of oats intended for seed, after they were thus
stripped, by being put through the mill, and attending to the
crops they produced, he was inclined to believed that the
appearance of the grain in that state, its being plump and
clear, free of shrivelling and darkness of colour, especially at
the extremities, is the best mark by which found seed-oats
may be distinguished from such as are hurt by the frost.-A
great proportion of ground lies waste.  The land-rent is a-
bout L. 1000 Sterling.  The average rent of farms is L. 20
Sterling; and the size is such as to give employment for
8 small oxen, 3 or 4 very small horses, the tenant, a man and
a boy.
