country where the sirname of Graham is so common as it
is here, it was very natural to find the appellation Grim's
Wall, converted into Graham's Dyke*.  The name itself
is of little consequence, but the wall is a striking monu-
ment of Roman activity.
   The soldiers of the Roman empire were not allowed to
be enervated by idleness.  They were constantly employed,
and often engaged in severe manual labour.  Not only the
walls which have been taken notice of, but also the various
roads which they made in Great Britain are clear proofs,
that they were called forth to exertion, and kept in active
life.  Along the south side of Graham's Dyke, a causeway
was formed for the more expeditious and comfortable tra-
velling of the soldiers from one part of it to another.
   Nearly opposite to Callander house, an earthen wall of
considerable height and thickness branches off from Gra-
ham's Dyke, runs through West-quarterhouse garden, and
reaches the old castle of Almond.  From that toward the
east, there are few or no certain traces of it to be seen; but
we may presume, that it once ended at Linlithgow, where
there was a Roman camp, on the very place where the
King's palace was afterwards built.  This wall has no fosse,
and being broad at the top, was probably intended to be a
road, as well as a line of defence.
