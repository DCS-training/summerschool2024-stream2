stronger and cheaper.  Many were yearly exported to Peters-
burgh, and the cities on the Baltic; and there was in 1783
an order from Paris to a coachmaker in Edinburgh, for one
thousand crane-necked carriages, to be executed in three
years.  This trade has since greatly increased.
   In 1763-There was no such prosession known as a Ha-
berdasher.
   In 1783-The prosession of a Haberdasher (which inludes
many trades, the Mercer, the Milliner, the Linen-draper, the Hat-
ter, tha Hoster, the Glover, and many others), was nearly the
most common in town; and they have since multiplied greatly.
   In 1763-There was no such prosession known as a Per-
sumer:  Barbers and Wigmakers were numerous, and were in 
the order of decent burgesses:  Hairdressers were few, and
hardly permitted to dress hair on Sundays; and many of them
voluntarily declined it.
   In 1783-Perfumers had splendid shops in every principal
street:  Some of them advertised the keeping of bears, to kill oc-
casionally, for greasing ladies and gentlemens hairs, as superior
to any other animal fat.  Hairdressers were more than tripled
in number; and their busiest day was Sunday.  There was a 
prosessor who advertised A Hair-dressing Academy, and gave
lectures on that noble and useful art.
   In 1763-There were no Iron Founderies near Edinburgh;
-The Carron Company's work was the only one of the
kind in Scotland, and it had been established but a few years.
   In 1792-There were many extensive Iron Founderies in
Scotland, and several in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.-
Cast iron which was formerly imported, is now exported in 
great quantities.
   In 1792-There are several Button Manufactories lately e-
stablished in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh which were un-
known in any former period.
