deed, that King David resided at Clackmannan, at least,
during the first part of his reign; once we find, that, in
the year 1330, his chamberlain, Reginald More, settled
his publick accounts there*.
   The old tower, which still remains, is said to have been
built by King Robert Bruce.  From the style of the build-
ing, indeed (for there is no date upon it), it appears to
have been erected about his time; and, from several names
of places, we may conclude, that it actually was the resi-
dence of some of the kings; as the following names seem
to indicate; King's Seat Hill, King's Meadow Park, and
others of a similar nature, in the vicinity of the tower.
The greatest height of this tower is 79 feet.  It contains
a variety of apartments, and has been surrounded by a 
moat, with a draw-bridge, part of which still remains.
Adjoining the tower, stands the old mansion, the residence
of the family, till the direct line became extinct.  Both
the tower and house, however, are fast crumbling into
ruins, and exhibit a sad spectacle of human grandeur.
Though said to have been once the abode of kings, and,
for many ages, the chief residence of one of the most an-
cient families in the kingdom, yet they now afford only a
very comfortless dwelling to a common ploughman.
   Henry Bruce, Esq., the last laird of Clackmannan, died
in 1772; and in him ended the direct line of the ancient
family.  His widow, Katharine Bruce, survived him till
November 1791, when she died, by means of an accidental
fall, at the great age of 95+.  She had in her proffession
