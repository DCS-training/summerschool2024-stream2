   Bishopric of Mortlach.-It is clear, from the evidence of
history, that on this occasion, by the pious gratitude of Mal-
colm, and in fulfilment of a sacred engagement, Mortlach
was exalted to Episcopal honours.  One Beyn, or Bean, was,
by Pope Benedict, made its first bishop, who, about 30 years
after, died, and was buried here.  Donortius was the second,
and next to him came Cormac.  These two, between them,
enjoyed their preferment more than 80 years, and, on the
death of the latter, succeeded Bishop Nectan, the fourth and
last of Mortlach; for in his fourteenth year, he was translat-
ed by King David I. to Aberdeen, which soon got the name,
and became the seat of the diocese.  And thus Mortlach,
from a dignified bishopric, sunk into an humble parsonage.
The fee was at Mortlach 129 years, from 1010 to 1139*.
Bishop Ramsay of Aberdeen, in the year 1246, appointed
13 prebendaries, of whom the 7th in order was the parson
of Mortlach.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Its jurisdiction and revenues were but small, comprehend-
ing no more than the church of Mortlach, the church of Clo-
veth, and the church of Dulmeth with all their lands: But, in
regard to precedence, it was the second in Scotland, that of St
Andrews being the only one before it, which extended over all
the kingdom, and whose bishop was then designed Episcopus
Scottae, or Episcopus Scotorum.
