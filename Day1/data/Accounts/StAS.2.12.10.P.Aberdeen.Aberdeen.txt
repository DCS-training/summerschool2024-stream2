small and by no means thick on the top of the Observatory, while
in the court below it was heavy and in large drops. The follow-
ing table, therefore, showing the rain collected by the rain-guage
on the top of the observatory, at the height of 74 feet from the
surface of the ground, cannot be looked on as perfectly satisfac-
tory. Yet perhaps the objections to which it is liable, are (though
of a different kind) not on the whole stronger than those that
might be urged against the indications of any similar instrument
however placed. Mr Innes, with the view of removing these ob-
jections in as far as they are capable of being removed, has taken
measures for observing the fall of rain in future at two additional
stations in the vicinity of Aberdeen; the one in a garden about half
a mile westward from the boundary of the parish, where the guage
is placed seven feet above the surface of the ground, and the other
at the light-house on the Girdleness, about a mile south-east from
the extremity of the parish, where it is placed at the height of three
feet above the ground.

	The prevailing winds are during the winter, north and east, and
during the summer, westerly; but there is so little of steadiness
in this respect, (excepting that there is a month or so during spring
when an easterly wind prevails very generally,) that it is difficult to
speak with any degree of precision about it. The following table
shows tbe direction of the wind during the last three years, no re-
gister previous to that time having been met with.
