and amenable for such abuse of property as is prejudicial
to the common-weal.  For though statute law never has,
and probably never will, intermeddle with a subject so deli-
cate, complicated, and difficult, as fixing limitations on the
use of property, it ought to be more generally understood
than it would seem to be, that malversations and abuses of
power, in the use of property, issuing in public detriment
and alarming depopulation, have already been brought un-
der the lash of the common law, at the instance of the
Crown, even in South Britain.  A lawyer of the last cen-
tury, Mr Robert Powel, of Wells, published a treatise, in
1636, intitled; Depopulation Arraigned, where, at page
84, he narrates a trial and sentence, at Michaelmas term,
decimo Caroli, anno 1635.  The judgment against this de-
populator, for converting so much arable into pasture, was
accompanied with heavy pentalties, and with circumstances
of humiliating disgrace.  Such as wish to be more fully in-
formed, may have recourse to the records of the times, not
omitting those of the Privy Council of England.

   Quarries.-There are 2 free stone quarries in this parish,
both of the harder kind.  And there is a limestone rock on
the west side of the river, at the Boat-pool, but, for want of
fuel, it is more eligible to purchase lime, than to burn it
here.

   Fuel and Coals.-Peats are very scarce, dear, and of
little strength.  The parish would have been in uncommon
distrets for want of fuel, long since, had it not obtained a
seasonable supply from the weddings of fir plantations, and
an easement of the duty upon coals, which begin to be used
by the lower ranks, because they afford light to spin.
Newcastle coal are bought from 1 s. 10 d. to 2 s. per barrel.
