make the air generally moist, damp, and penetrating,
but seldom proves fatal to the inhabitants, except a few
children carried off by the croup in cold rainy seasons.
The rheumatism is the most prevalent disorder in this 
country.  It is supposed to be more frequent since lin-

ing, which was once the general clothing over the
Highlands of Scotland.  It is evident that this opinion

potatoes have become the principal food of the lower
classes of the people.  And certainly, though this use-
ful and wholesome root contains no hurtful quality, yet

solid in their early period of life, and to whom this root
was scarcely known, but now live by this three-fourths
of the year, no wonder though disorders should prevail
which were formerly less common.  But the danger, if
there is any, I apprehend, proceeds from the dressing
and imprudent management, rather than from the qua-
