of every shooting season, has ever invited the keen and active
sportsmen of the neighbourhood, to enjoy their favourite a-
musement, on its rough and uncultivated surface.-The lower
part of the parish, which gradually declines towards the south,
is almost entirely arable.  The soil is thin and sandy.  When
excited by lime, or other stimulating manures, it produces
rich and luxuriant crops; and the grass, which grows upon
those parts of the land which are improved, is kindly and nou-
rishing.  The average value of the best cultivated land, in
the lower end of the parish, is from L. 1 to L. 1:  10 per a-
cre.

   Agriculture and Produce.-The system of agriculture, which
takes place in Kirkpatrick-Durham, is much the same as that
which is adopted in other parishes in the south of Scotland:
As the principles of that system have been fully explined,
in the account of those parishes, the statistical history of which
has already been presented to the public, it would be improper to
detain the intelligent reader by unnecessary repetitions.-
The quantity of grain, annually produced in the parish, can-
not be precisely ascertained:-The reason is this:  The im-
provement of land being only in its infancy, large fields,
which formerly lay wild in a state of nature, are every year
brought into a state of tillage; so that, upon a probable sup-
position, a tenth, or twelfth part of arable land, within the
parish, which was formerly neglected, is put into a situation
of bearing grain; and consequently, till the whole arable land, in
the district, is reduced to a state of culture, it will be impossible
to fix, with any degree of accuracy, the extent of the annual
produce; because the account of any one particular year, is
extremely different from that of another.  It is, however,
proper to remark, that, even in the present partial state of cul-
tivation, there is much more grain produced in the parish,
