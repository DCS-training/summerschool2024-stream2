considerable number of thriving plantations in this district,
which may, in time, so far supply the above want.  The most
thriving appear to be those on the sides of Faraneze*; which
may convince the neighbouring proprietors, whose lands are
lower and better sheltered, what may be done on their estates.

   Coals, and Lime-Stone.-Coals have formerly been wrought
along the banks of the Lavern, about the middle of this parish.
There is just now a coal pit working at the west end of Loch-
libo, with a steam engine upon it, the property of William
Mure, Esq. rented at L. 60 per annum.  There are coals also
at the east end of the parish, on the lands of Mr Cuthbertson
of Lyon-Cross; but, as the roads leading there are not made,
and the ground is by nature a deep clay, he has only dug them
for his own consumption.  Lime-stone is found in plenty in many
parts of the parish; free-stone both at east and west ends,
used for building houses.  Moor-stone also abounds, but
there are no good quarries of it, the stones being so hard, that
it is difficult to work them, or to brittle in their texture, that
they moulder down with the weather.  Hence, building in
the centre of the parish is very expensive++.

+If a thriving larix be worth a guinea in the course of 20
years, it is worth a landholder's pains to calculate what an acre
would produce.

++There a plenty of free-stone very near the village of Niel-
ston; but, being at the bottom of deep banks on the Lavern, it
cannot be drawn up but at an enormous expence.
