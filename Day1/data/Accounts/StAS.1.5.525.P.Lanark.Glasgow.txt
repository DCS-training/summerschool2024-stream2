benevolence, and engaging in a mutual insurance against
poverty.  Persons either  of the same name, or coming from
the same county, or employed in the same trade, or living
in particular streets of the city, or having been in similar
situations, are associated together; and by weekly or
monthly payments, amounting to about 4 s. in the year,
create a fund and revenue, out of which their wants are
supplied, when they are disabled from attending to their
ordinary occupations, either by occasional distress, or the
infirmities of age; and this as a right, and without the
humiliating idea, that they are receiving charity.
   The frugality and good sense, with which these societies
are generally managed, deserves a more particular expla-
nation.  When any of their members are sick, or other-
wife disabled, they are visited by some of the society,
accompanied by a surgeon.  If the disease is pretended,
or brought on by debauchery, they are not found entitled
to the supply; but if the cafe is real, they report whe-
ther the patient is confined to his bed, or otherwise in-
capable of working.  If he is confined to bed, they or-
der the highest provision that their regulations allow,
which in most cafes amounts to 5 s. a-week, and which
is instantly and regularly paid, during the time he con-
tinues in that situation.  If the patient is not confined to
bed, a lower provision is ordered, agreeable to the nature
of the cafe, and which is commonly from 2 s. 6 d. to 4 s.
per week.  At the expence of the society, he is visited by
a surgeon while necessary, and afterwards during his con-
valescence, by some of the members who have the charge
of that department, and who regularly report his situation to
the society; and as soon as he is able to work, the weekly
payment is withdrawn.  In some of these societies, a cer-
tain sum is allowed to defray the funeral of a poor mem-
ber, and a sum is given to his widow on his decease.
