tenants worse accommodated, than in this parish; for, who
could suppose that, among the 385 houses in the parish, there
are nor forty, in which a person accustomed to a decent ac-
commodation, would choose to lodge a single night.  Per-
haps their being so frequently obliged to remove their cotta-
ges makes them less solicitous to them comfortably
built.  The greatest number are built of earth, and are usu-
ally razed to the ground once in 5 or 7 years, when they are
added to the dunghill.  Indeed, they cannot afford to build
them of better materials, not even with clay and stone; and
yet, as proof of the late increase of population, when any
of these mean huts become vacant, there are perhaps five or
six candidates for them; and the succesful one is suppo-
sed to owe the preference to superior interest.  But, among
the chief disadvantages of this parish may be reckoned the
extreme poverty of many who become farmers.  Too many
assume this character who have hardly any stock to begin
with; and the consequence is, that, after struggling for a
few years to keep credit,-they at last sink under the load of
poverty, while the landlord has a long arrear of rent due to
him.  In a word, it cannot be denied that many among us
have the name of farmers who ought more properly to be
day labourers.  Indeed, some of their own hired servants
have the necessaries of life with a greater degree of comfort
than their masters, the farmers. One circumstance very pre-
judicial to the farmers is, that they are too much at the
mercy of their servants.  When a servant engages with a
poor farmer, he bribes him with a promise of high wages;
and, when money fails, he allows his servant to sow a quan-
tity of corn for his own use, and to keep a cow in summer,
and pserhaps two or three in winter, on the farm, which
brings certain ruin upon the tenant in the end. We will add,
that it is a great loss to have so few justices of peace in the
