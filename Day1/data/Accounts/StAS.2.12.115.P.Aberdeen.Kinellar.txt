ed bones, placed on beds formed of clay, hardened by fire, and
the hillocks made up of soil from a distance.  The stones of Cairn-
a-veil being removed a few years ago, it was found to contain a
stone coffin, about six feet long, of six flags, holding neither bones
nor ashes, but some black dust.  The churchyard has been the
site of a Druidical temple, several stones of which, of great size
and weight, though fallen, yet remain above ground, and others
have sunk in the earth.  It is matter of surprise by what process
such weighty masses have been transported from such distances as
they must have been.  Cairn-semblings occupies an elevated spot
on the hill of Achronie, and is visible over a great extent of coun-
try to west and north.  Near to this place is a large stone on which
Irvine, the much redoubted Laird of Drum, sat, and made his testa-
ment, on his way to the battle of Harlaw, where he fell.
   Parochial Registers.-The oldest register begins in 1640, con-
taining the texts and discipline; but no separate register for mar-
riages, baptisms, and burials was kept till a dozen years ago.  An
unwillingness to register baptisms is but too prevalent among pa-
rents.  The following entry appears, under date " May 4th 1684,
This day was read from pulpit an act of his Majesty's Council, for
a solemn and religious fast, upon account of the rigour of the last
winter, the'coldness of the present spring, and the great mortality
of bestial, to be observed on Wednesday the 7th."  It is men-
tioned in a note, that the snow and frost continued without any -re-
laxation eighteen weeks.
   Land-owners.-The proprietors are, Mrs Brebner of Glasgow
Forest, valued rent, L. 315, 2s. 2d.; Dyer Society, Kinellar,

                     III.-POPULATION.
   The population is smaller than that of any parish whthin the sy-
nod.  For a considerable number of years previous to 1777, the
number of persons exceeded 400; but from that time to tbia census
in 1831, it was considerably less.  In 1821, 359; in 1831, 449;
218 males, and 231 females.  The increase betwixt 1821 and
1831, was owing to a large distillery being,set on foot at Black-
burn, and an attempt to raise a small village, neither of which have
succeeded.
