corporated, viz. smiths, skinners, taylors, weavers, shoemakers,
wrights, and bakers, each having their deacon; but these
seem to have had no other foundation for their privileges

empowering the community to incorporate the trades.  The
weavers are as numerous as all the other trades put together;

free of duty) than they are able to answer, so that great part
of that article is bought here by strangers.
   There are no remarkable public buildings or antiquities,
except the ruins of the abbey or monastery; and these de-
serve a very particular description.  The present church, of
