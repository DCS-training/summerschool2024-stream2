   Roads.-When a spirit for improvement in agriculture
first appeared in this part of the coutnry, the roads were
in bad repair.  The only way of transporting grain or
meal to the Lothian markets, was on horses backs.  It is
obvious how expensive this mode of carriage must have
been.  But besides being expensive, it was attended with 
another, and even greater inconvenience:  In winter, when
there was most grain to dispose of, and the farmers flood
most in need of money for paying their rents, the roads,
or rather tracts, were often impassable.  But since that
branch of the great road from London to Edinburgh,
which runs through this parish, was made (which is near-

returns home laden with coal or lime.  The roads to Ber-
wick and Eyemouth were, till lately, in a bad state; but now
they are in good repair.  The principal cross roads in the
parish are also much improved.  All these roads do great
honour to the publick spirit of the gentlemen who planned
and promoted them; for they have put, as far as human
art can, this distant inland tract of the country on a level
