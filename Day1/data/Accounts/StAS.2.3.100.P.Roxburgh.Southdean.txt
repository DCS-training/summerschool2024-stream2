fastnesses at one of the extremities of this parish; and no place
could be so well adapted for this purpose in the perilous and bloody
times of the persecution of out church.
     Antiqwuities.--Tumuli or cairns, formerly prevalent in ths parish,
have now almost disappeared. There are still the ruins (and some
of these to a considerable extent) of ancient strongholds-, or peels,
as they are called. Tere remain, too, the sites of ancient en-
campments; which are for a circualr form.
     Eminent Men.--James Thomson, author of the Seasons, spent
much of his childhood and youth in this parish. His father was
minister of Edman, near Kelso, at the time odf the poet's birth, but
was translated to Southdean two years after that event. His
tombstone is still in this churchyard.

                           III.__POPULATION.
     Since, the beginning of last century, the population has greatly
decreased, owing to the land being let in more extensive farms.

sident facotr on his property here. James Elliot, Esq. of Qolf-
lee, and Robert Henderson, Esq. of Abbotsrule, ate heritors to a

     Character, &c. of the People.--The character of the people os

gling; but large and lawless bands of poachers have infested our
moors for two years past.  Our people are generally stout, healthy,
