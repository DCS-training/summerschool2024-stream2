bodily infirmity, and affliction from the hand of providence,
were his greatest crimes.
   The number of poor on the roll are 10, 8 women and 2
men, all of them aged and infirm.  Each of them has a
particular district in the parish to which they are confined,
and every householder keeps them one night for every merk
land he labours.  They get clothes and shoes from the session
annually, and the expence of their funerals is paid from the
poor's funds.  There are therefore no travelling beggars of
this parish.  Many poor families also require assistance to
buy seed corn, or purchase meal, cattle, &c.  The frequent
misfortunes at the fishing, greatly increase the number of
widows and orphans, who must receive occasional supply.
The only fund for the support of the poor is the Sunday
collections, which amount to about 7 L. per annum, and a
few fines imposed by the session for misdemeanours.  In
1784 and 1785, the whole money in the sessions hands was
exhausted, excepting 10 L. Sterling, which had been lent, and
could not be recovered at that time.  It has been since re-
paid; and the funds now amount to 17 L. Sterling.  So great
was the poverty and distress of the people in general at that
time, that many would have perished for want, but for the
charitable contributions of well disposed persons in England
and Scotland, and a large supply sent from government.

   Population.-In 1733 there were 987 souls.  In Dr Web-
ster's list, in 1755, 911; in 1775, 1223; and January 1792,
1285.
