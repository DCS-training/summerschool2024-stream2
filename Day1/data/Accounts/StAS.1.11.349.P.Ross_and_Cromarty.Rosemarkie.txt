   Disadvantages.-It is to be regretted, that the state of im-
provement, in this and the neighbouring parishes, is still to
far behind, though most of the heritors have set a good ex-
ample to their tenants.  This proceeds from different causes.
The principal one is the want of leases, sufficiently long to
encourage the people to improve their farms.  What induce-
ment can a farmer have, to be at any extraordinary pains in
improving his possession, by inclosing, raising turnips, sown
grass, etc. when, at the expiration of a short tack, he must
either pay an additional rent, or be deprived of all the fruits
of his toil and industry?  Another serious grievance, to the
farmer, is the scarcity of servants, and the increase of their
fees.  The young fellows, for the most part, either go into
the army, or travel to the south, where they meet with better
living, and higher wages.  It is certain, however, that every
man has naturally a strong attachment to his native place,
which makes him very unwilling to abandon it.  Surely,
then, it must be the interest of all concerned, to induce the
people to remain at home, by every reasonable encouragement.
This will always be found the most effectual method.

   Circumstances attending the Scarcity in 1782-3.-In this coun-
try, the crops in a great measure failed in 1782 and 1783, which
were remarkably hard for the farmers.  Yet none here, at
that time, were supposed to have died of real famine.  The
white peace and other grain from England, on the event of
the peace, afforded a most seasonable supply to many poor fa-

as they were, fewer were sick among the parishioners, than have
been observed before or since; which may in a great measure
be attributed, to their being unable to spend their money in
drinking spiritous liquors, and thus being Obliged to live
soberly.  Another good effect proceeded also from this tem-
