     of Longforgan.

   Origin.-The origin of this village most probably had
been for the accommodation of the retainers, and the more
immediate dependents of the Baron of the Castle; and most
probably all ancient villages owed their origin to the fame
caufe.  For they paid little or no rent, but what they did
pay was mostly in kind.  The rest was made up in a variety
of services; so that their whole time, almost, was at the
command of their superior; and also their personal atten-
ance on their superior in the field was an essential and indis-
pensible condition of their possessions; and except this last,
such was the exact situation of the villagers of Longforgan
of the mains or family-farm, to sow, reap, carry it into the
barn-yard, thresh it out, and take it to market; to fetch
lime, stone, slates, and sand, or any thing else wanting for
the castle or demesnes; to plant all the trees upon the estate;
to give so many days labour in the gardens or fields; to be
ready at all times to go messages, either on foot or on horse-
back, to any distance; and, in short, there was scarce any
kind of servitude about the place they were not bound to
perform, many of which continued till the present proprie-
tor came in possession.

   Inhabitants.- The village belongs entirely to the estate
of Castle-Huntly; consists of one principal street, which is
now a turnpike-road, and several lanes.  It contains 126
families, which, at 5 for each family, makes 630 inhabi-
tants of all ages.  Of these, 3 are considerable farmers from
L. 60 to L. 150 per annum; 36 are small farmers or acre-
men, paying from L. 5 rent to L. 16 per annum.  Of this last
class almost every one has a trade or occupation; so that
the management of his little farm is the employment of his
leisure hours only, which improves his health, and gives
him many little comforts, which he could not expect other
