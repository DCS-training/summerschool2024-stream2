careful in guarding, on the one hand, against imposition, and,
on the other, that no necessitous person be neglected*.
Though there are no begging poor belonging to the parish,
yet the parishioners are much oppressed with beggars and va-
grants from other districts, many of whom are very worth-
less.

   Village and Markets, etc.-The village of Blair-Gowrie is
pleasantly situated on the north side of Strathmore, almost close
upon the river Ericht.  It was made a borough of barony, by
a charter from Charles I. in 1634.  The whole of it be-
longs, in property or superiority, to Colonel Allan M'Pher-
son, who is proprietor of about a fourth part of the parish.
The situation of the village is very healthy, and it is well
supplied with water.-There are 3 fairs held in it annually,
and some attempts have been made to have a weekly market
in it, but with little success.  The village is well supplied
with butcher meat and other articles.  It has increased very
much within these few years.  As it is situated on a military
road, any of the inhabitants may retail ale and spirits, on pay-
ing 1 s. annually.  There are no less than 19 dram-shops in
it, which must be attended with bad consequences to the mo-
rals of the people.

   Bleach field, Cloth, Stamp-office, etc.-There is a bleach-field
in the parish of Rattray, about a mile from Blair-Gowrie.
The cloth is whitened as it is sent from different quarters. A-

*In 1782, the harvest was late, and the crop was much inju-
red.  In 1783, the meal was scarce and high-priced.  The kirk-
session employed the poor's stock in purchasing meal at a distance,
which was sold at prime cost.  A small proportion of the barley
meal, voted by Parliament for the relief of the Highlands, was
sent to this parish.  Many of the heritors provided good seed
corn for their tenants, where it was necessary.
