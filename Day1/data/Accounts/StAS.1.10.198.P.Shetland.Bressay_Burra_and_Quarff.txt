agriculture; but, with proper encouragement, much might
be done.

   Sheep, Etc.-There are about 5000 sheep and 500 milch
cows, besides oxen and young cattle, in there united parishes.
The number of horses is great.  They are small, but very
hardy.  Many of the sheep are of the best quality, and pro-
duce fine wool, which is made into stockings, some of which
sell at a high price, and are reckoned the best of their kind
by the merchants of Letwick.  The returns, however, to the
maker are very small.  By manufacturing this wool into
cloth, the people would gain much more.  Few of them
seem to be acquainted with the proper method of making
butter.  Cheese is never made here.  The time of preparing
the ground, and sowing, is commonly from the middle of
March to the 1 ft of May.  The harvest is for the most part
over by the end of September.
