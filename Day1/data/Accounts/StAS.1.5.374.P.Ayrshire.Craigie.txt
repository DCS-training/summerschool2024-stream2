garden.  The number of scholars is much greater in win-
ter than in summer; and, at an average, during the year,
may be about 60.  The wages, per quarter, are, for Eng-
lish, 1 s. 6 d.; for writing, 2 s.; for arithmetic and Latin,
2 s. 6 d.; and a complete system of book-keeping is taught
for 10 s. 6 d.  The schoolmaster's place, including all per-
quisites, may amount to L. 30 Sterling.

   Poor.-There are, at present, 12 persons who receive
public charity.  The sum spent yearly, for their support, is
about L. 20.  This arises from the weekly collections made
in the church, and from the interest of a sum of money
belonging to the parish.  None who reside here are vagrants.
Attention is given, that the children of those who are needy
and indigent, be properly educated.

   Roads.-The roads were formerly made and kept in re-
pair by the statute labour, but this is now converted into
money; 3 d. is paid for every pound Scotch of valuation,
which may amount to about L. 40 Sterling yearly.  The
roads are kept in good order, considering the great num-
ber of coal and lime carts that are constantly passing over
them.

   Character.-The people are regular, peaceable, and indu-
strious; anxious, in their several occupations, to provide for
themselves and their families; and what they acquire by
active labour, they enjoy with moderation.  Few of them may
be called rich, though almost all of them are far removed
from poverty.  When circumstances occur, that call forth
their humanity, they are charitable.  They enjoy, in a 
reasonable degree, the benefits and comforts of society, and
are, in general, contented with their circumstances and si-
tuation in life.
