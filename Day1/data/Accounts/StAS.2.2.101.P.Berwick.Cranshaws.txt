tions of stones in the other half of this parish, which, tradition says,
commemorate the death of two twin brothers of the name of Edgar,
who both fell while commanding different portions of an army that
had mutinied. They are still known by the name of the Twinlaw-
cairns. * Cranshaws castle belongs to Charles Watson, Esq. of
Saughton; it is an oblong square of forty feet by twenty-four. The
walls are forty-one feet high. The battlement on the top is mo-
dern; otherwise the date of the building might have been pretty
nearly ascertained, as the water conduits are in the form of cannon.
Before the union of the two kingdoms, it had been used by the in-
habitants on this side of the parish as a place of refuge from the
English borderers, as the old castld at Scarlaw (of which very lit-
tle now remains) had probably been by the inhabitants of the
other division.

<TABLE=III-POPULATION.>

        In 1754, the population was                    214
        At the time of last Statistical Account,       164
        In 1821,                                       156
           1831,                                       136
        In 1833, it does not appear to exceed          100

   The decrease appears to have been owing to the junction of
farms, and change of system.

   There are two proprietors in the parish who hold lands to the

   The people generally marry early, and in consequence, we have
neither male nor female unmarried above the ages of 50 and 45.
They are Generally very poor, but contented with their situation
and circumstances, frugal, sober and industrious, generally regular
in their attendance on religious ordinances, and, I am happy to add,
that the form of godliness is observed in most of their families. I
have been told that discussions have sometimes taken place on a
Sabbath morning as to who should enjoy the privilege of going to
church.
