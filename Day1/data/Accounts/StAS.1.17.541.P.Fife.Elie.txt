a considerable size, are built here.  There is a manufacture of
check and bed tikes, and also of ropes, by the Messrs Wood.

   Ecclesiastical State.-Sir John Anstruther is sole patron of
the church of Ely.  There are a few Seceders, Independents,

plication of a criminal, the town is obliged to ferry him over
immediately, and dare not ferry over his pursuers, till he is
half way over the Frith.  This, it is said, was claimed and,
