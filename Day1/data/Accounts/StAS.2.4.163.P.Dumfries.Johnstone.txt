Flax is now cultivated upon a very small scale, (and regularly decreas-

Pasture of 500 cows and 700 young cattle, estimating 3 of the latter

The annual thinning and periodical fellings of wood may be reckoned
	to average                                                          600 0 0

	The gross quantity of pork sold, including the cottars' pigs, may
amount yearly to L. 2000. This, indeed, is our staple commodi-
ty, and by far the most important article of saleable farm produce
in the parish. But, as the food of these pigs is included under the
general heads of potatoes and grain, from the sum specified, we

feeding.
	The annual produce of gardens and orchards is extremely trilling,
and the common vegetables in them are included in the head of
green crop above stated.
        Manufactures.-There are a few of the various ordinary handi-

At St Ann's Bridge not less than 516 caresses of pigs, weigh-

fourteen pounds to the stone, have been this season manufac-
tured into hams and flitches by Mr James Thorburn and Co.
which has proved to be a very profitable investment of ca-
pital. When sufficiently dried and fit for use, it is usually car-
ried to Longtown, where it commands a ready-money sale for
the markets of Newcastle, Shields and Sunderland, from whence
part of it is shipped to London. It is said, indeed, that in the
town of Newcastle alone; forty cart loads per week are, through
the year, at an average, disposed of. The fluctuatin in the price
of this article is often rapid and unaccountable, even to the dealers
themselves and seems not to be so immediately affected by the
rise of fall of other fat produce, as by the properous or declin-
ing state of the manufactures, especially in the south. At Pan-
