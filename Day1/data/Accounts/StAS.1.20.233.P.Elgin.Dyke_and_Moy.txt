the lands of Drumreach, and Lake, and even some part of 
Binsness, have been covered.  But, from the tract of the 
winds, it can do little more damage in that quarter than has 
been done already.  About 20 years ago, a march-stone was 
placed on the top of a sand-hill, from 40 to 50 feet in 
height, to make it more conspicuous; some said, the march 
would tumble down; others, that it would sink out of fight,
in the sand.  but the stone always remained visible, sinking
gradually, with the hill, till the hill had entirely forsook it,
and sled.  From the north-east corner of this parish, where
the sand has been long accumulating, it is by strong winds 
carried into the sea, and sometimes is carried across the river 
mouth.  At the town of Findern, in a blowing day, one may 
feel the sand sharply striking on his face, from the west 
side.
   Another effect of the sand-hills, is a change made, in the
last century, of the bed and mouth of the river, which has
now got a shorter passage to the sea, and occasioned an en-
tire removal of the harbour and town of Findern, for more 
than half-a-mile down the frith.  There is a narrow neck 
of land, belonging to the parish of Kinloss, and barony of 
Meurton, to which it lay contiguous, while it was on the 
right side of the river.  It stretched up the frith, for about
3 miles, towards the Maviston hills.  On this neck, now co-
vered with sand and bent-grass, and fit only for sheep pa-
sture, and summer huts, for stell fishings, stood the town and 
harbour of Findern, three-fourths of a mile west of where 
they now are.  At the western end of this neck of land, now 
called
   The Old Bar, lay the mouth of the river, which then
run between this bar and the estate of Culbin, in the 
parish of Dyke.  The old bed of the river is yet vi-
sible, and the old bar is yet insulated during the flood of 
spring tides, except at its western end, where the ground is 
     VOL.XX.
