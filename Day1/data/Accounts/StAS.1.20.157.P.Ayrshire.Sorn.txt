sed by 2 others, leading from Edinburgh to Ayr, by diffe-
rent routs.  Separating a little on this side of Muirkirk,
the one passes through the village of Old Cumnock and
Auchinleck, and the southern part of this parish; the other,
on the north side of the river, passes through the village of
Dalgain, and by the church towards Mauchline, where both
meet again.  In the original plan of this latter road, an un-
fortunate error was committed; instead of being carried
down the narrow vale, close by the river, as far as Sorn,
which would have formed both a level and a beautiful line
of road, it was carried through the higher grounds, at some
distance, where there are two ascents of considerable length
and steepness; the one of these must be encountered by those
who go to Muirkirk, the other by those who return from
it.  So sensible are the trustees of this error, that they were
insufficient for this purpose.  They have it now in contem-
plation to alter the line in one or two places, in order to
avoid the steepest pulls; and thus to palliate an evil which
cannot be entirely removed.  These various roads, though
not every where of such dimensions, nor in such repair, as
might be wished, may yet, upon the whole, be considered as
good, and highly useful.
   Beside a number of smaller bridges, there are two across
the river of Ayr; one of these is in the lower part of the
parish, on the south road from Edinburgh to Ayr; the
other, consisting of two arches, is close by the church, where
the Glasgow road intersects the north road to Edinburgh.
For this latter bridge the country is indebted to the Rev-
erend Mr Steel, of whom I shall more than once have occa-
sion to make honourable mention.  This bridge was built
solely by means of contributions, which he collected in the
parish and neighbourhood.
