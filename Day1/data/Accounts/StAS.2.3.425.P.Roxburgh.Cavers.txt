                          PARISH OF CAVERS.*

       PRESBYTERY OF JEDBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE.

                 THE REV. JAMES STRACHAN, MINISTER.

     I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
    Name.--Cavers is an appellation common to a number of places
both in Scothland and England. The term, however, is not found
in the Saxon language, and is therefore supposed to have been in-
troduced by a prior people. In the Cambro-British, there and it is
words, Cae and ber, signifying short field or enclosure; and it is
not improbable that this is the source from which the name is de-
rived, notwithstanding that both the extent and openness of the
parish, as it now exists, would seem to render the appellation most
inapplicable.
     Extent and Boundaries.-- The parish lies nealry due east and
west long the south side of the Teviot, and is computed to be
about 24 miles long, and varying from 8 to 2 miles in breadth. It
is boundede towards the north-west and north, by the parishes of
Hawick, wilton and Minton; on the east and south-east and west, by
the parishes of Newcastleton, Ewes, and Westerkirk.
     Its figure, on a general survey, may be regarded as in some de-
gree resemblinfg a sand-glass from the circumstance of its being
narrow at the middle, and expanded towards each extermity; but
its outline, when minulely traced, is found to be exceedingly
irregular, owing to the peculiar manner in which it intersects,
and is intersected, by other parishes. From the weensland-
mill, below Hawick, to the junction of the Allan Water with
the Teviot, above it, (including a distance of about six miles),
south side of the river; and this, together with the whole of the
parish of Kirkton intervening, divides, in some measures, Cavers pa-
rish into two departments, leaving, however, the upper it is only about
