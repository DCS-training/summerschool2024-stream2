           PARISH OF ROXBURGH.

PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE.

          THE REV.  JAMES HOPE, MINISTER.


         I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-ONE conjecture as to the origin of the name of this
parish is, that Roxburgh is a contraction for Rogue's burgh; ano-
ther, that it is a contraction for Rose burgh; and for each, a special
reason is alleged, viz. the character of its ancient inhabitants, and
the beauty of its situation. Another conjecture is, that the name
may be derived from Rox, a Saxon word, signifying strength: and
another from the circumstance that, by Lord Hailes and others, it
has been spelled Rokesburgh and Roches-burg. From the simi-
larity of Rokes and Roches to Rok and Roch, (a saint, it would
seem, in the Romish calendar,) the burgh of Roxburgh may have
originally been dedicated to saint Rok or Roch,-whence the
name may have come.                                                          I
   Extent, Boundaries, &c.-The parish extends about 8 miles
in length, and in breadth varies from 1 to 5 miles. From the ex-
tent thus given, a much larger number of square miles of surface
might be inferred than it will be found to contain. There does
not appear to be more than fourteen square miles. This circum-
stance is accounted for by the irregular and peninsular form of the
parish. The parish is bounded by Maxton, Ancrum, and Crailing
on the west; by Eckford on the south; by Kelso * on the east; and
by Kelso and Makerstoun on the north.

<FOOTNOTE>In the former Statistical Account of the parish of Kelso,
it is mentioned, that Kelso parish consisted at one time of the par-
ishes of Kelso, Maxwell, and St James'. This statement has frequent-
ly been repeated. (Vide Haig, Morton, &c.) It appear
