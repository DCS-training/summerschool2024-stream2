   Leucopibia is probably a corruption of???.  This
campden supposes was Ptolemy's translation of Candida
Casa*, which transcribers have changed into Leucopibia.

   As the Roman and Greek names signify a white house,
or white houses, so Whithorn is supposed to have the same
meaning.  Campden says; horn is the Saxon/word for a
vessel of any kind; adding, that some people use inkern
for an ink vessel; but it seems more probable, that inkern
is a corruption of inkhorn, "a portable case for the instru-
"ments of writing, commonly made of horn+."
   As there are the remains of a Roman camp within one
mile's distance of the town, may not Whithern be a cor-
ruption of Via Tertiae, i. e.  Legionis, vel Cobortis?  Via
Tertiae might easily pass into Vitern, and Vitern again into
Whithern.  In Britain, the V is often changed into W.
and the W into V.  Thus in London, many say, "Weal,
"Vine, and Winegar, are wery good wittle, I wow."

   The Town described.-The town consists chiefly of one
street, running from N. to S. From this street there are
several alleys stretching to the E. and to the W.  About
the centre of the town, there is a good hall for public meet-
ings, adorned with a spire and turrets, and provided with
a set of bells.  A beautiful stream of water, over which
there is a good bridge, runs across the main street, dividing
it nearly into two equal parts.  The houses are generally
covered with slates, and made very commodius.

   2.  I did not mean to ascribe the quick growth of trees to pruning, but
to cutting over in an horizontal direction.  From the stocks, shoots will
spring to justify my remark.  This treatment I have only known applied
to oaks and ashes; to firs it wourld be death.
