     Of Kirkmichael.

In terms descriptive of the objects of nature and local situa-
tions; in the names of the seasons of the year, of mountains,
lakes, brooks, and rivers, their language is as just and ap-
propriate as any in the Highlands of Scotland.  There are a 
few words, however, that would seem peculiar to themselves,
but which may be traced to the parent Celtic; some words
are used by them metaphorically and not unappositely applied;
of the latter are brath, signifying in the Druidical mythology,
fire, particularly the fire of the universal conflagration.
Brath is used in this country to denote a high degree of ve-

rage.  When they would express the impossibility of per-

mane an eisg air-he has the luck of fish.  From this word,
the manes of the Romans have been originally derived.  Ac-

in use among the people here, especially in their songs.  They
borrowed it from the Hebrid Isles.  It is of Norwegian ex-
traction, and used as the appellative for a hero, derived from
Arminius the celebrated hero of Germany, mentioned by Ta-
citus.  Praeliis, says that admirable writer, ambiguus, bello
non victus.-caniturque, adhuc barbaras apud gentes.  In
this country they have still many proverbs, and many of them
beautiful, both with respect to language and sentiment.  The
insertion, however, of one of these, at present, may be suf-
