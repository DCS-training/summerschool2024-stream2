live rather too sparingly*; although there is reason to believe,
that, in this, as well as other respects, their manners, customes,
dress, etc. have considerably altered within these 50, or event
within these last 20 years; and perhaps the extreme, into which
some may now be in danger of running, is that of living rather
beyond their income, the fatal consequences of which need
not be prognosticated.  As to crimes, no instance has occurred
of any native of Carnock being subjected to a criminal pro-
cess for there 10 years past.  May the virtue, sobriety, indus-
try, and regularity of the inhabitants continue and increase! 
Amen!
