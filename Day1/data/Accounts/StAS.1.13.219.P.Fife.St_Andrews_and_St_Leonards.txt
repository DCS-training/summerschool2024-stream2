year.  Number of alehouses, inns, etc. in the the town, 42;
and in the county, 6; which is rather below the average
for the last fix years.-The number of cottages in this pa-
rish has varied very little fox these many years past, very
few of the farmers choosing to diminish or to increae their
number; the progress of manufactures may, in all likeli-
hood, render cottagers more and more necessary for sup-
plying a sufficiency of reapers in harvest, more particularly
as at that busy time the dressing of their wheat lands occu-
pies many of their ordinary servants.-1793, May.  A fail-
cloth manufacture is now beginning in St Andrews's.
   Whatever has been said above in general, concerning the
town and parish of St Andrew's must be considered also as
including the parish of St Leonard's, which is intermixed
with the other.

     ST LEONARD'S PARISH
     By the Rev. JOSEPH M'CORMICK, D.D. Minister of St
Leonard's and Principal of the United College.

   THE parish of St Leonards' consists of a few districts in
different quarters of the town and suburbs of St Andrew's,
together with 2 farms in the country, about 3 miles distant
from the town, all originally belonging to the Priory, af-
terward to the College of St Leonard's and now to the
United College of St Salvator and St Leonard's.  It is pro-
bable that the erection of the parish is of the same date
with the foundation of the College whose name it bears.
Although the principal of St. Leonard's did not always of-
ficiate as minister of the parish, and in the instance of Mr
George Buchanan, was not even a clergyman, it is certain,
that for some time before the Revolution, the two offices
were held by the same person; and ever since that period
the principal of the College has been a clergyman and mi-
nister of the parish.
