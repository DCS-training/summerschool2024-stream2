ground is bomb proof in the middle of March, and mere
puddle for some time thereafter.  In 1680, as nearly as
can be recollected, there was a famine in this and the neigh-
bouring counties, of the most fatal consequence.  The 
poorer sort of people frequented the chuch-yard, to pull a 
mess of nettles, and frequently struggled about the prey,
being the earliest spring greens, which they greedily fed
upon boiled without meal or salt.  So many families
perished from want, that, for 6 miles in a well inhabi-

Nursing women were found dead upon the public road, and
babes in the agonies of death sucking at their mother's

death, crawled to the church-yard, for the purpose of more
immediate interment, that the earth, which denied them
subsistence, might piously receive their remains into its bo

servants wages, and letting small improvements toward,
the skirts of the hills, called Hill-improvements, all concur
as causes of great alteration in the customs and style of li

grations, to an extensive degree, have happened from a 
country where such oppression prevails, is not to be won-

the situation of a people.  Whole tribes, who enjoyed the
comforts of life in a reasonable degree, have of late years

and freeholders.-The language principally spoken is the
Gaelic, and the names of places are derived from that lan-
