of April till the latter end of May, and the oats and pease
from the beginning of March till the middle of April.
Some rye is sown mixed with oats, but beans may be said
to be no crop at all in this parish.  Generally the corn is
not gathered in before the middle of October, rarely in
September, and in some years not before the latter end of
November.  Potatoes are raised in great abundance, and
are of very great importance.  They constitute the prin-
cipal part of the food of the lower class of the inhabitants
for more than three quarters of the year.  They are plant-
ed from the middle of April till the middle of May, and in
drills with the plough.  About the middle of August we
begin to raise them for immediate supply; but the corn
harvest business is completely ended before we raise them
for storing.  It may be observed here, that we know
nothing in this parish of the disease called curled tops,
which proves so prejudicial to this useful plant in some
other places.  Field turnips, white and yellow, are sown
from the middle of June till the second week of July, and
in drills.  There is no hemp town, and but little flax, and
that for private use only.  It would be tedious to mention
the variety that still obtains in the rotation of crops.  The
most approved course, however, is gaining ground among
us, and will, it is expected, become prevalent.  Much is
done in the way of inclosing, but much remains to be
done.  The value land derives from being inclosed is uni-
versally acknowledged.  A neld at the distance of about
half a mile from the town was lately inclosed; when open
it yielded only L. 8.  rent.  It was inclosed at the expense
of between L. 25 and 30, and was sold at the price of
L. 550, and reckoned by the purchaser a good bargain.
Sea ware, street and stable dung, and lime, are all used for
manure.  The sea-ware is much used by those who live
