   Resident Heritors.-The number of proprietors at pre-
sent, besides the feuers in the town of Peterhead, is ele-
ven; there are five of these residing in the perish.  The
Governors of the Merchant Maiden Hospital at Edinburgh
have considerably more than one-third of the rent of the
parish; and three of the residing heritors have not much
above L. 100 rent.
   The greatest part of this parish belonged once to the an-
cient family of the Earl Marischal; at present, his repre-
sentatives possess no property here.  There is not an estate
which has remained in the family of any person, who had
lands in the beginning of this century, excepting part of
the lands of Invernettie, half of which is the property of a
collateral branch of the original purchaser from Earl Ma-
rischal in the beginning of this century, and one small
estate called Downie-hills, which was originally a wadset
from the Marischal family, and now the absolute property
of Dr Thomas Livingston, physician at Aberdeen, who, by
his mother, is the representative of an ancient family of
the name of Robertson, which long enjoyed this estate; and
one of them of the name of Thomas, about 60 or 70 years
ago, the fifteenth Thomas Robertson, who possessed the
wadset, writes a song to be found in the second volume of
Allan Ramsay's Collection, in which he invites the Stirling,
the name of his mistress, to take up her residence there,
concluding with the following lines:

     I'll bring thee where I will devise
     Such various ways to pleasure thee,
     The velvet fog thou wilt despise,
     When on the downy hills with me.
