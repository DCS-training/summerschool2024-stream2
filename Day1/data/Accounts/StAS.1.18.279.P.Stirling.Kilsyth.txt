from making the attempts or at least to account for his un-
willingness to hazard it.  But let it not be supposed that the
high fields are useless, or of little value: on the contrary,
they are rich and productive to the farmers; they are perhaps
more productive than a great part of the ploughed land.
They yield great abundance of the richest and earliest pasture
in the west of Scotland; and being of a south exposure and
uneven surface, they afford every variety of soil and shelter,
either for summer or winter.  The beautiful green hills, are
covered with the sweetest pasture; the valleys, or rather in-
terveening marshes, which are likewise numerous, produce
abundance of coarse hay: and every little hill or inclosure,
has its little rivulet.  The demand for fat cattle has increased,
and seems to be increasing, and the high grounds have for many
years been entirely employed to feed cattle.  It is generally
allowed, that there is no strath in the west of Scotland more
favourable for the purpose than the strath which lies westward
from Kilsyth, through Campsie, and Strathblain*.

sufficient choice of the best pasture: and besides the coarse hay is thus greatly
injured.
   2d, In purchasing their cattle, they are not always at due pains to pick the
best out of the flock; whereas, if they were to exclude all the shots, it would
be ultimately for their interest, though the cattle were dearer in the mean
time.
   3dly, They run too much upon highland cattle: doubtless, they take on
the beef fast, and feed very quickly, and when fed, are sweeter than larger
cattle, But, perhaps, it would be the interest of the grazier, to buy up
