   Miscellaneous Observations.-The language of this parish is
no doubt much inferior to the English in pronunciation and
accent; but there are in it few or no peculiarities in articula-
tion and found as in some countries of Scotland, and even in
England.  The taste of the age in which we live, is here, as in
other parts, much altered from what it was between 15 and
20 years ago, as to expence of living, such as in dress and shoes,
meat and drink, tea and tobacco.-The inhabitants of this pa-
rish are generally given to industry.-The fuel is mostly coal,
there being little use made of peat here, except in the drying
of corn, and for the kiln and making of malt.-Most of the
people in the town of Lamington have 5 or 6 acres, at
L. 1:  12:  6 d-There are two millers, one in Lamington,
and the other in Wandel, and the thirlage or multure, which
the tenants give to the mill in their own barony, is a mutchkin,
or the fourth part of a peck per boll.  There is a lint mill in
Wandel mill, and a toll in Hartside in the same barony.

ton, of the ancient and honourable name of Baillie, with whom the aforesaid
Sir William Wallace was allied by marriage; in proof of which, and as a
piece of curiosity, Wallace's chair is now in Bonnington, in the possession of
Lady Ross Baillie, the representative of the family of Lamington, being re-
moved from the tower of that place.  The chair is remarkably broad and stout.
-There was a beautiful orchard in the mains of Lamington, in which were
found all kinds and sorts of the finest and richest fruits, when possest by the
late laird of Lamington, about half a century ago, or even later, but it is now
quite destroyed.
