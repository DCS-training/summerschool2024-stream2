     The Statistical Account.

   Lime is supplied from Lord Elgin's lime works upon the
Forth, and from the Aberfoil quarries, about a mile west
from the bridge of Gartmore.  In the first place, it is brought
to Stirling by water carriage, and transported by land to the
countries that want it.  The Aberfoil lime is carried only by
land; and as the coals with which it is burnt are also brought
by a long land carriage, it is sold at a high price, but is of a
superior quality to the other.
   Were the upper Forth and Devon made navigable, and a
communication made between them by a canal, or by the
tide-way, those countries would be mutually benefited; the
one by the sale of their coals, the other by obtaining them at
a lower rate than they do at present.  Both the countries upon
the upper Forth and upon the Devon could be supplied with
lime from the tide-way; and the people upon the Forth
would have their choice of taking either that or the Aberfoil
lime, which could be afforded cheaper were the prixes of
coals lower.
   In my report to the Right Honourable the Lords Com-
missioners of Police in December 1773, I have proposed se-
veral plans of navigation and junction of these two rivers.
That report has been laid before the public, and has been the
subject of two meetings of the noblemen and gentlemen in-
terested.  At the last of these, upon the 2 d instant, certain
parts of the plan were adopted, and some additions made,
of which I am now to give an account.
   The calculations of the expence of navigating the upper
Forth were made upon the supposition that the district be-
tween it and Craigforth dam is deep water; I am now inform
that there are several fords in that district ant in the tide-
way betwixt Kildean and the dam.  If this be the case, the
expence of removing these fords will be found to be consi-
derable.  It may be eligible to look up at Kildean, and to
