bove, and very deep.  It is remarkable that it never
freezes in winter, but very readily in sping, by one
night's frost, when the weather is calm.  Loch Clachan is
a bason formed by the stream which issues from the last
mentioned, at the short distance, and not much above a mile
in circumference.  Lime rock has been discovered 2
little below the Mains of Davoit in the bed, and by the
sides of the river. A vast many metallic cubes of one-
eighth to one-fourth of an inch or more, are found, and
appear in this rock; they are of the colour of lead, and
contain a great proportion of the metal.

   Stipend, Poor, Chureb, Manse, &c. -The stipend, in
1781, was 5 zl. 6 s.  But in 1784, there was an augmenta-

2 L., or thereby, annually; but they have the dues of mar-

   The church of Dunlichty was rebuilt in 1759, and has
had but one repair since, of 25 L., about 4 years ago.  The 
church and manse of Daviot, in 1763 and 1764, but not
so substantially, having had two repairs since, to the ex-
tent of between 80 L. and 90 L. each time, and now much
in need of a third, at the distance only 7 years from the
last repair given them.  It has happened to these build-
