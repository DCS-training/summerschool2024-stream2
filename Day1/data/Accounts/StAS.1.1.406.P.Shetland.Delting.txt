   The situation of this, and indeed of every parish in these
islands in the years 1782 and 1783, and for four years after that
period, was deplorable indeed.  The crop of 1782 failed; the
crop of 1783 was still worse; and, to complete the calamity, a
general mortality of the horned cattle and sheep took place
during the winter, as before mentioned.  Few, in companion,
were left alive; and the distressed possessors of their poor re-
mains were obliged to fell the greater part, in order to purchase
meal for their families.  The meal was from L. 2: 5: 0 to

the country.  Government gave some supply; and news of
their distress called forth liberal subscriptions for their relief,
both in England and Scotland.  With these provisions were
bought, and sent to the country, and distributed in propor-

meal, which was fold out in such proportions as were thought
prudent, according to the number in each family.  There is
reason to think that none died from mere want; but there is
