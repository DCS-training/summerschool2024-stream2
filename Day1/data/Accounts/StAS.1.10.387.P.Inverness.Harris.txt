   Character of the People.-The rude state of the poor peo-

represented with fidelity, scarcely requires a comment.  It
too clearly indicates neglect on the part of those whose in-
terest and whose duty it was to have enlightened them.
Their vices are such as must be supposed, among a people
professing Christianity, to proceed from difficulty of access
to gospel ordinances, and from a total want of police.  We
