     Statistical Account

ber of communicants of the Established Church this year
was 713, and it is supposed, that those of the other two,
do not, between them, exceed 360.  The parish church
was rebuilt 16 years ago.  And, what is rather a singular
circumstance, all the outer walls, which are rough ashler
work, are built out of one stone, upon which hallow fires
formerly used to be burnt, and which also served as a
land-mark to the fishers, when at sea, being upon the top
of a gravelly eminence.  The Earl of Errol is patrom.
The stipend is L. 35: 11: 1 4/12 in money, 48 bolls of meal,
and 16 bolls of bear; with a manse and offices, and 6 acres
of glebe.  A process of augmentation, by desire of the Earl
of Errol, is going on.  His Lordship has also given orders
for building a new manse, as the present one is very old
and ruinous.  This, to be sure, is rather an uncommon ex-
ample, but, at the same time, worthy of the Lord High
Constable of Scotland, and the son of a man, who made the
happiness of mankind his study; and who possessed that
amiable talent, so rare to be met with, of securing the re-
gard of all who approached him, and sending them away
pleased with themselves.  The poor's funds consist of
L. 130 laid out at interest, the weekly collections, and the
penalties.  There are about 70 people upon the poor's 
roll,  The contributions from the two chapels, for their
support, are not considerable.

   General Character.-The people are sober and industri-
ous.  Except one smuggling business, there has been no
trial, before the Court of Justiciary, of any one belonging
to the parish, these 14 years.  Some time ago smuggling
was carried on to a great extent, but it is now almost en-
tirely given up.
