soil, so the climate is also different.  It is more mild in the
westermost parts of the parish, where the soil is generally
light and dry, than in the eastermost part of it, where the
soil is stronger and wetter.  But, notwithstanding the dif-
ference of both soil and climate, the people are in general
healthy; many of them arrive at old age.  The most com-
mon diseases are agues, rheumatisms, and scrophula.  The 
frequency of the last is probably owing to intermarriages.
The ague has not been so frequent these 2 years past as
formerly; but consumptive complaints are more common,
probably owing to the scrophula; as it is mostly those who
are of that habit that become consumptive.  About 14 or 
15 years ago, the Honourable Mr and Mrs Baillie, both
very humane and benevolent, caused inoculate, at their
expence, above 70 children in this parish and neighbour-
hood; all of whom did well, except 2, who were of a scro-
phulous habit.  Ever, since inoculation has been rather more
generally practised, and has been the happy means of pre-
serving many lives.

   Rivers.-The river Leader runs along the W. end, and
the river Eden along the E. end of the parish.  Both have
their source in Lammar Muir, and run into Tweed.  They
formerly abounded with very fine trout, the first also with
salmon.  But since the farmers have set about improving
their farms, neither salmon nor trout are near so plenty in
either.  This is thought to be owing to the liming of the
grounds on each side of the rivers which by heavy rains,
is often washed down into the rivers, and is supposed either
to scare or kill the fish.

   Plantations-There are large plantations of wood in the
E. end of the parish, which are a great ornament to that
part of the country, as well as a benefit to the adjacent
