   The number of births, in proportion to the number of
inhabitants, is increased.  From a comparison of the num-
ber of births from 1726 to 1736, when the parish was
more populous, with that from 1776 to 1786, when it wa
less so, the proportional increase was found to be about
one-tenth.  The air is good, and the situation dry; the
practice of inoculating children for the small-pox, is also

   Stipend, etc.-The stipend is between L. 80 and L. 90

ther of the same kind, on a higher hill, west of the former;
it is likewise within a mile of the Tay.  This hill is seen
from the north windows of the Old Town of Edinburgh.
The lines about these camps are rough stones.  The highest
of these hills is called Normans-Law, or the Hill of Nor-
thern Men.  The tradition concerning these camps is, that
when the Normans invaded for plunder, and not for conquest,
they deposited their spoils there, till they got intelligence
of a force being raised in the country, that was able to re-

Cardinal Beaton's castle stands by the church of Criech.
