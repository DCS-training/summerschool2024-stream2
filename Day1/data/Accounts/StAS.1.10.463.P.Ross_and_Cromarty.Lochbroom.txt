and open boats, according to the conveniency and circum-
stances of the users of it.  They sometimes, bring it, after
landing, in creels or baskets on horseback, from the distance
of two or three miles; and, notwithstanding this trouble, they
often find that it abundantly repays their labour; for it pro-
duces exuberant crops out of lands that were formerly thought
good for nothing.  The virtue of it, however, does not con-
tinue above five or six years; and at the expiration of such a
period, from the time of laying it on the ground, they are ob-
liged to leave the lands ley for a certain number of years
commonly three or four.  During this interval, the-ley lands
yield very good grass.

   Climate and Diseases.-The air of this, as well as that of the
neighbouring parishes, is somewhat damp and moist; which is
chiefly imputable to their near vicinity to the Atlantic Ocean.
The rains are much more frequent and heavy in there corners
than in the lower and interior parts of this kingdom; and
often prove a prodigious obstruction to the farmers, in the la-
bouring and harvest seasons.  They-always come on with the
westerly winds; and when it blows in a contrary direction,
the weather is usually fair.  Notwithstanding its wetness, the
climate is not unhealthy, and many of the inhabitants live
to a good old age; few of them, however, complete too
years.  The people are not subject to any epidemical distem-
pers; but, in spring 1791, they were visited by a most ma-
lignant fever, which swept away great number of them.
