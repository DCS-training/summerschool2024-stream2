the W. and N. by the parish of Strath.  The breadth of
the parish is from one mile to three and a half, being, like
all parts of the island of Sky, intersected by different arms
of the sea.
   The two extremities of the parish consist of considerable
tracts of tolerable pasture-ground, well calculated for rear-
ing black cattle, equal in quality to any the neighbourhood
produces; indeed, the whole west side of the parish is made
up of a pleasant mixture of arable and rough ground; and
there one may likewise find three considerable stools of na-
tural wood, consisting of oak, ash, elm, birch, arn, rone-
tree, hazle, willow, and other aquatics.
   Wood is peculiar to this part of the island of Sky, there
being hardly a tree, natural or planted, excepting here; it
may be superfluous to add, that this contributes much to
the ornament, not to say usefulness of the different tenures
on which this valuable commodity grows.
   The east side of the parish, particularly from the farm of
Knock to Tormore, forming an extent of five miles in
length, and from one to one and a half in breadth, is arable,
the soil being deep clay, in some places of a bluish, in others
of a reddish colour, exceedingly adapted to ditching and
hedging; produces middling crops of oats and potatoes,
though, in spite of its southern exposure, the harvests are in
general late, owing to the ground being damp, and in some
places spouty, added, as was formerly mentioned, to its
clayey texture; it cannot however remain a doubt, that
by proper attention to inclosures and ditches, (should en-
couragement offer), an industrious farmer would here find
a good subject to speculate and practise upon.  The barony
of Sleat is now subdivided into 26 different farms or tene-
ments, which at a moderate calculation, may sow about 20
bolls each, in all 520.  There is hardly any barley, the
sea-ware growing on the shore being almost entirely laid
