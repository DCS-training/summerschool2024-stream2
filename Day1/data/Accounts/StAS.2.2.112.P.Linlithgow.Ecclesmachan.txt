112               LINLITHGOWSHIRE.

James Hamilton, Esq. of Bangour; Robert Warden, Esq. of
Blackcraig; the Earl of Buchan also possesses a small pendicle
of land. There is no country seat, nor any resident heritor in
the parish.

                     III.-POPULATION.
   The population has probably diminished during the course of
the last century, chiefly on account of the union of small farms,
and the decay of the villages. There is now scarcely an individual
in the parish who is not directly or indirectly employed in agri-
culture. The following table will show the variations at the se-
veral dates. We cannot account for the smallness of the number
in 1792.

         The population in 1755, according to Dr Webster, was 330
                           1792, former Statistical Account,  215
                           1801, Government census,           303
                           1811,          Do.                 267
                           1821,          Do.                 303
                           1831,          Do.                 299
                           1841, Government census,           303

   The last amount was partially increased by an influx of railway
labourers. A private census in 1839, which ascertained only 263
inhabitants, gave the following results: Persons under fifteen years
of age, 103; between fifteen and thirty, 76; between thirty and
fifty, 55; between fifty and seventy, 19; above seventy, 10. The
number of unmarried men above fifty, 6; number of unmarried
women and widows above forty-five, 10. There are 51 fami-
lies. The average number of children in families where there
are any, is 3. The number of inhabited houses is 50; uninha-
bited, 4. For the last three years, the average number of births
is seven annually; of deaths, two; of marriages, one. In these
three years have been born three illegitimate children.
   Forty-one families and 220 individuals belong to the Established
Church; ten families and 43 individuals are attached to the Dis-
senters. Of these are eleven farmers, three blacksmiths, two car-
penters, one mason, one tailor, two weavers, and ten day labourers.
The rest of the males, and many of the females, are employed in
agriculture. For many years past, there has not been a public-
house in the parish.

                      IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Agriculture.-The whole parish has been enclosed mostly by
hedge and ditch, and only a few acres in it have never been sub-
jected to the plough. The whole surface employed in tillage and
pasture, little of which is permanent, may be estimated at 2310
