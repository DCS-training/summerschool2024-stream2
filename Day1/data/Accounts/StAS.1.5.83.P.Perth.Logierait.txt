the natural hopes and fears of the human mind, in a state
of simplicity and ignorance.  Lucky and unlucky days are
by many anxiously observed.  That day of the week upon
which the 14th of May happens to fall, for instance, is
esteemed unlucky through all the remainder of the year;
none marry, or begin any serious business upon it.  None
chuse to marry in January or May; or to have their banns
proclaimed in the end of one quarter of the year, and to
marry in the beginning of the next.  Some things are to
be done before the full moon; others after.  In fevers, the
illness is expected to be more severe on Sunday, than on
the other days of the week; if easier on Sunday, a relapse
is feared.
   Immediately before the celebration of the marriage cere-
mony, every knot about the bride and bridegroom, (gar-
ters, shoe-strings, strings of petticoats, etc.) is carefully loosen-
ed.  After leaving the church, the whole company walk
round it, keeping the church walls always upon the right
hand.  The bridegroom, however, first retires one way
with some young men, to tie the knots that were loosed
about him; while the young married woman, in the same
manner, retires somewhere else to adjust the disorder of her
dress.
   When a child was baptised privately, it was not long since
customary, to put the child upon a clean basket, having a
cloth previously spread over it, with bread and cheese put
into the cloth; and thus to move the basket three times
successively round the iron crook, which hangs over the fire,
from the roof of the house, for the purpose of supporting
the pots when water is boiled, or victuals are prepared.
This might be anciently intended to counteract the ma-
lignant arts, which witches and evil spirits were imagined
to practise against new born infants.
