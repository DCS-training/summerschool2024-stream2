     Statistical Account

stance, that the estates, in this parish, of all these gentlemen
just, mentioned (one only excepted), from but a small part
of their landed property.  They all posses estates in other
parishes; and the consequence is, only two of them have
their residence here.  The estate of Clackmannan, belonging
to Lord Dundas, is strictly entailed, as well as the estate be-
longing to Mr. Erskine of Mar.  The house upon the estate
of Clackmannan is almost a ruin, and not fit to be inhabit-
ed; the proprietor, however, it is said, intends to take the
advantage of so delightful a situation, and to build a house
suited to it, near to the site of the old tower.  From the 
seat of the family of Mar being at Alloa, in the imme-
diate neighbourhood, there never was a house upon their
estate in this parish.  The house upon the estate of Sauchy
is placed at the distance of about 60 yards within the pa-
rish of Alloa; but the greatest part of the pleasure-grounds,
and even part of the garden, are in the parish of Clack-
mannan.  The pleasure-grounds are laid out and beauti-
fied with much taste and judgment.  A greart part of these
grounds, when in the possession of Sir John Shaw, once 
formed a deer park, consisting of 100 acres, and surround-
ed by a very high wall.  The only house in the parish,
that deserves the name of elegant, is just now finished by
Mr. Bruce of Kennet, from a beautiful design of Mr.
Harrison of Lancaster.  Placed in one of the finest situa-
tions the country affords, it is also built in a style of su-
perior elegance to most of the house to be met with in
Scotland; and exhibits in all its parts an equal attention
to convenience and utility, as it does to elegance and
taste.
