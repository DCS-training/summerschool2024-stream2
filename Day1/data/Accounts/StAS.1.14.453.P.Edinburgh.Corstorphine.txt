more to be introduced.-Turnips are cultivated in this
parish, but not to a great extent.  Though they are rear-
ed here to great perfection, and repay the farmer's toil,
bringing this year (1793), near 6 l. the acre, and consumed
upon the farm; yet they are not reckoned the most pro-
fitable green crop, as they exclude the wheat crop, which
is here of such importance.  The Swedish turnip hath
been introduced into this parish:  the seed is sown in beds
in a garden, and planted out in drilled rows.  The farm-
ers, in general, dislike this species of turnip, and prefer
the common one; although it certainly may be subservient
to the best purposes.  On farms where cattle or sheep are
fed with turnip, as the common species is so apt early to
shoot, or be rendered useless by frost, where there is no
supply of any other succulent or green food, the cattle
must either be supported with hay and corn, at an enor-
mous expense, or the farmer must bring them to market,
however disadvantageous to his interest.  The Swedish
turnip, as it stands against the frost, and is not apt to
shoot, offers to the farmers the most probable and certain
relief against this inconvenience.  This season, it hath
been cultivated to a considerable extent at Gogar, and
with great success, notwithstanding the dryness of the sea-
son of planting.  It will also serve most advantageously to
fill up blanks in the rows of the other turnip.-There is
not a great number of milch cows kept by the farmers,
the profits of the dairy not being reckoned equal to those
which arise from the produce of the lands, when in til-
lage.
   They still prepare for market, a considerable quantity
of what is well known over the kingdom, by the name of
Corstorphine Cream.  I have not been able to receive any
account of the time when it was first introduced.  I have
