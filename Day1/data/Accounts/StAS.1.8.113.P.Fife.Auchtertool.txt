seems to be on the increase throughout Scotland, will perhaps,
eventually, be unfavourable to the population of the country,
and most undoubtedly to the personal character and morals of
its inhabitants.  It forces the people from the active, healthy
employments of a country life, to take refuge in manufactur-
ing towns and populous cities, which may literally be laid to
be the graves of the human species.  It is accordingly ob-
served, of towns in general, and of large manufacturing towns
in particular, that the inhabitants are of a more sickly and
delicate appearance, than their neighbours in the country.
This may arise from the operation of various causes.  From
the sedentary life, to which they are accustomed, which en-
ervates and enseebles the constitution; from the impure and
unwholesome air, which they are constantly breathing; and
above all, from the habits of dissipation and prosligacy, which
are always too certainly contracted, in any great concourse of
people.  And, as it is from towns like there, that our armies
anti navies are mostly supplied with recruits, it is easy to see,
how ill fitted, men, of such a description and mode of life, will,
in time, become for defending the liberties and dearest rights
of their fellow citizens, and enduring the watchings, the
dangers and the soils, which are incident to the professions of
the soldier and the sailor.  It was the same body of men, that,
on the banks of the I brasymenus, and the Ausidus, humbled
the pride of the Roman eagle, and empurpled the field with
patrician blood, who were afterwards routed on the plains of
Zama, though still fighting under a loader the foremost in the
world, whose very name was almost sufficient to secure him
of victory.  But the luxuries of Saguntum, according to the
Roman historian*, had enervated and ensesbled the victorious
Curthaginians, and rendered them an unequal match for the
hardy Romans, over whom they had so often triumphed.
