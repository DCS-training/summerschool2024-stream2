     of Kilninver and Kilmelfort.

     NUMBER XXVI.

     UNITED PARISHES OF KILNIN-
     VER AND KILMELFORT.

     (Presbytery of Lorn.-Synod and County of ArgyLe.)

     By the Reverend Mr PATRICK CAMPBELL.

     Name and Extent.

   THE strictest research into the eytmology and meaning
of ancient names must often terminate in probable
conjecture; and the following account of the names of those
parishes lays claim to no higher authority.-Kil-an-inver sig-
nifies the chapel or burying ground at the foot of the water,
it being situated where the Water of Euchar discharges itself
into the sea.-Kil-na-maol-pbort, contracted Kilmelfort, signi-
fies in the Gaelic language the chapel, or burying-place, of
the round bays or harbours, viz. Lochmelfort, which runs
three miles into the middle of this parish, ending in two
round bays with good anchoring ground, where ships of any
burden may ride in safety.-Taken together, the united pa-
rishes are nearly of a square form, extending from E. to W.
and from N. to S. about 12 measured miles.  Kilmelfort
lies south of Kilninver; but in populousness, valuation, and
extent, does not exceed the one half of the other.  The mi-
nister preaches in both alternately; the distance betwixt the
two places of worship is six miles.
