     Of Rescobie.

trict of country called a Parish; and, like most local
names, has probably been framed at first from some real
or supposed affinity to the situation.-The figure of the
parish is irregular, but the contents may be about 16 or
18 square miles, mostly in cultivation, with some thriving
fir plantations, and very little waste ground.  It has no
river nor considerable stream, but yet is sufficiently water-
ed for domestick and agricultural purposes; and particu-
larly, it is intersected by the loch of Rescobie, which is
a mile long, washed by the loch of Balgavies, in the pa-
rish of Aberlemno, on the N. and E., and was so on
the S. and W. by the loch of Restennet, in the parish
of Forfar; but lately this last mentioned loch was taken
off by a drain, a project which at first was by many
thought rather problematical; but the success has afford-
ed ample justification, by affording speedy indemnifica-
tion, together with the permanent source of a very hand-
some revenue to the owner, a gentleman of celebrity in
the political world, and long and well known by the
honourable appellation of a friend to his country.  Still,
however, the springs and rills, which formerly fed this
drained lake, continue to discharge themselves by the
drain into the loch of Rescobie, from whence, through
the loch of Balgavies, issues the chief branch of Lu-
nan water, which gives name to a bay on the German
Ocean, into which it falls about 12 miles E. from this
kirk.

   All these lakes abound in marl; a manure of approved
and extensive use in husbandry, eagerly sought after by
the industrious farmer; and where it is skilfully applied,
producing very great effects, being nearly similar to lime
