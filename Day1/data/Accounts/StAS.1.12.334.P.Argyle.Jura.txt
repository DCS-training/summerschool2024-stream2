     Statistical Account

from every corner of the parish.  The harbours of Jura, in-
deed, give it great advantage for large vessels, but through
all the islands there are creeks for small fishing boats.  Per-
haps the best mode of encouraging the young men to embark
in this undertaking, would be for the gentlemen to join with
them in fitting out a few boats of moderate size for that pur-
pose.  Should these boats be successfull, they would be the
means of circulating money, an article which, from the ab-
sence of trade and manufactures, is very scarce among the
lower classes.  The litte sums introduced in this way, should
rouse a spirit of adventure, and give new springs to every
kind of industry.  From such small beginnings the extensive
fishery carried on by our busses took its rise.
