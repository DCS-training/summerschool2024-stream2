opposite coast from Edinburgh, all the way east to St Abb's
head, and the frith of Forth, with the shipping constantly
going up or down, present a grand object always varying.
It is remarkable in this hill, that the soil of it in general
is equally good and deep with the most fertile grounds be-
low, and the ascent so gradual from the west, that carria-
ges, with safety, may go to the top of it.

   Bird of Passage, etc.-The Birds of passage here are
dotterel, woodcock, swallow, cuckoo, and lapwing.  Of
these last, it is observed, that they have of late returned
much earlier in the season that they were wont to do, pro-
bably owing to the uncommonly open winters we have had
for some years past.  But all these birds of passage, the gen-
tlemen and farmers too would heartily welcome to a long-
er visit among them, could they only get free of the
crows, which are very destructive in the spring to the
wheat, and every other kind of grain.  At the same time,
the destruction they do in this way, very probably is in a
great measure balanced by the very effectual assistance they
give in destroying the cob-worm: Of this there was a satisfy-
ing proof lately in this parish.  A servant of the Earl Of Kel-
lie, who had just finished the sowing a rich field with oats,
was much vexed to see it in a little covered all over with
crows; in various ways did be endeavour to drive them
off, but all in vain, till at last hotshot some of them, when,
to his great astonishment, upon opening up their stomachs,
he found them quite full of cobworm, and not one grain
of oats.

lars, etc.  It has undergone many expensive repairs within
