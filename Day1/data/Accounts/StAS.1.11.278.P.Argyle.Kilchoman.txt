circumstances enable them to be above taking such drudgery
upon themselves.

   Climate and Diseases.-Our climate is the same with that
of other maritime places.  If we have our westerly winds and
rains, we are free of the frosts and snows of the east, snow
never continuing above a day or two with us.  An instance
of the wholesomeness of that climate, may be seen in the
healthfulness of our people, who are seldom or never visited
with any epidemical distemper, and generally live to a good
age.  The small pox, which used to make a vast devastation,
is now easily got over by inoculation; one surgeon having,
last season, performed that operation upon more than 800
children, very few of whom died.  Some people advanced in
years were also inoculated, with good effects.  The poor
were inoculated gratis, and the operator enjoys their blessing.

   Wild Animals.-Any one, that has a right to keep a gun
and dog, may find plenty of game here; such as partridges,
woodcocks, blackcocks, moorfowl, plovers, wild geese and
ducks, and wild pigeons; also otters, rabbits, and hares, sea
and land barnicles.

   Black Cattle.-The rearing of cattle is a principal ob-
ject with the gentlemen of Islay, who have the merit of
having brought the Islay cattle to vie with the best of their
neighbours at market, and to be much run upon.  The farm-
ing business may be pursued to advantage in Islay; but black
cattle have been its greatest riches of late years.  There are
about 800 of these annually sold out of this parish, at the
average price of 3 L. 15 s.; they are carried by drovers to Dum-
barton and Falkirk, and even to England, occasionaly.
