and south parts are likewise much beautified by small planta-
tions at Westown and Clowburn, and by the hedges and other 
fences, which enclose a great proportion of the low grounds. 
Part of the enclosures belonging to Carmichael, one of the 
seats of the Earl of Hyndford, falls within the boundary of 
this parish on the S. W. and greatly improves its appearance 
in that quarter.  From the height of the ground, the air must 
be cold and penetrating.  The river, where it runs slowly, is 
frequently frozen over for several weeks together, in a severe 
winter.  The frost is, probably, rendered more intense by the 
moorish and wet lands, which lie around the skirts of the hill, 
as well as by the river itself.  In the year 1782 and 1784, 
the crop was greatly damaged by it. 

     River, Fish, etc.-The Clyde, which rises about 25 miles
to the southward, is here swelled into a large river.  Along 
the upper part of the haugh-grounds, it runs with a pretty 
rapid current; but, about 2 miles below, its motion becomes 
much flower, and its depth increases.  For several miles down-
wards, except in a few places, it continues very deep, and 
makes many beautiful it leaves the parish, it rushes with an im-
petuous torrent over the rocks which lie in its bed.  In the 
upper part of this course, there are several good fords; but 
they are often rendered impassable, especially in winter, by 
the heavy rains, or melting of snow.  In such cases, the com-
munication to the eastward is by the bridge at Thankerton, 
in the parish of Covington, which is at the distance of 2 1/2 
miles from the village of Pettinain.  This very useful bridge 
was built about 14 years ago, by voluntary subscription, and 
cost upwards of 700 L.  The country, on this account, is 
much indebted to the public-spirited exertions of the clergy-
man who was then minister of that parish, and of some of
