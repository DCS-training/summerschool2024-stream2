of small estates farmed their own lands.  At this periodo, little
profit arose from agriculture; and it is only since farms were
united, that great profits have been made.  It is now to be
feared, however, that farming is going to the opposite extreme;
and the writer hereof cannot help thinking, that too great
property, and too extensive farming, is a very great loss to
any country.  In the parish of Eccles, some farms are far too
extensive, considering the good quality of the land.  Some tenants
possess above 900 acres, several 800, and scarcely can a farm
of 50 or 60 acres be got for any rent.  In land such as that
of Eccles, there ought not to be a farm exceeding 300 acres.
This quantity of land would support a family very decently,
and besides afford an ample provision for their children; and,
in the opinion of some, it is very improper to elevate men
too high above their station.  As many of our farmers have
got a very narrow education, riches have often the unhappy
effect of making them proud, and leading them to treat their
superiors with insolence and contempt.

   Rent and Proprietors, etc.-The rent of this parish, at pre-
sent, is nearly 11,000 L.; and it will advance considerably in
a very short time, as some old leases, upon extensive estates,
must soon expire.  There is no farm, since the author has
been minister of the parish, but what has been doubled in rent,
and some of them have been tripled; and if grain and stock
continue to hold the value they do at present, it would not be
surprising, if, in the course of a few years, the rental of this
parish should exceed 18,000 L. or even 20,000 L. per annum.
There is a farm, near Eccles, that expires in a year or two,
rented at 180 L., and it is credibly reported, that 480 L. has been
offered, and refused.-There are above 30 gentlemen, pro-
prietors of estates; some of whom possess 1,400 L., many 800 L.
and 900 L. per annum, many considerably less, and some small
