     Statistical Account

sent number, of those that receive aid from the public
parish fund, is about 16.  Upon setting forth, that, from
extraordinary loss, accidental misfortune, or sudden and severe
distress in their family, any are reduced to such a situation as
to require a greater interim supply, than the ordinary session
funds are able to afford to one family, then, by order of the
session, an extraordinary collection is intimated from the pul-
pit, to be made for their benefit, either at the church doors,
or from house to house within the parish, as circumstances may
require.  Whatever is collected is given to them, that they
may have assistance suitable to their present urgent necessity.
Upon a favourable change of circumstances, they again sup-
port themselves by their industry, without having recourse to
sessional aid.  When they are in such indigence as not to be
able to educate their children, the session always pays the
school fees, for teaching them at least to read the holy scrip-
tures; as they judge it their duty to see the children of the
poor well educated, and consider that the best bestowed cha-
rity, which procures for them the means of education.

   Heritor and Rent.-There is but one heritor, the present
minister, who is proprietor of the whole parish.  The vil-
lagers in the Ferry are all his feuers, for their houses and
small gardens:  The farms are his property lands.-The va-
lued rent of the parish is 2183 L. Scotch money.  The value
of the rental cannot, with accuracy, be easily ascertained: a
great part of it being paid in victual, the value must vary, ac-
cording to the prices of grain, every year.

   Scotscraig Mains.-The farm of the mains of Scotscraig
was originally church land, belonging to the archbishopric
of St. Andrew's.  The Pope, by his bull, allowed the arch-
bishop to feu out said farm at the sum of 132 L. 18 s. 8 d.
