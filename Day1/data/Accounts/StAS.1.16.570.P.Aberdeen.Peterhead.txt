now more attention paid to the nature of the feed; Blains-
lie, and what is called the Chief Baron's oats are in repuse,
frequently purchased for seed.
   There are a great number of hawks in the parish which
remain untouched; 30 years ago, on an estate within a
mile of the town of Peterhead, I am informed it was an
article in the leases of the tenants not to break them up.
They were called meadow ground, and their cattle pastured
on them in summer.  There are a number of inclosures,
mostly of earthen sences, with a ditch in the inside, which
is found with some attention to be a sufficient fence.
   There are some earthen fences, with a thorn-hedge.
The thorns are much neglected; I have no doubt of their

other parts of the parish, there are a considerable number
of inclosures, partly of stone, and partly an earthen fence,

preferable to any other mode of inclosing.  Earthen fences
can be built from 2 d. to 3 d. per yard; faced with stone,
four feet high, 6 d.; complete stone fences of the same
height at 1 s. Sterling.
   The size of the farms is so various, that it is not easy to
ascertain what may be the average rent.  They are in ge-
neral from L. 2 to L. 50 or L. 60 Sterling.  There are only
three above L. 100, and one farmer pays rent nearly to the
extent of L. 200.  These large farms are not under the imme-
diate management of the principal tacksmen; and to an in-
telligent farmer, nothing will more quickly convey a just
