     Statistical Account

The cause of depopulation here is chiefly owing to the
near attraction of Edinburgh, to a monopoly of farms, and
the use of two-horse ploughs, (by which means the farmer
works with about half the number of servants he former-
ly employed), and the laying down so much ground in
grass for hay, which, when the soil answers, is judged one
of the most profitable crops.  One cause of the uncommon
number of sectaries is, that a Burgher meeting house was
several years ago erected in the parish, and another of the
Antiburgher kind on the borders of it, which at their
erection were much crowded; but which, however, have
not gained seven proselytes from the parish church for the
last 7 years; they rather seem to be on the decline.  These
establishments must be a heavy burden upon poor people;
but they are productive of worse consequences, in directly
counteracting the design of Christianity, which is to make
men live together as brethren; and in supporting super-
stition and fanaticism, which are mistaken by many for
religion, and maintained with a violence and flaming zeal
proportioned to the ignorance of their deluded vota-
ries.
