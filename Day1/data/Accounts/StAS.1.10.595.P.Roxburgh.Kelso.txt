Surely this amazing quantity of food must injure the tone of
the stomach, and, from the air let loose in digestion, to what
an immense magnitude may it not be distended, by which
the whole chylopoetic viscera must be much oppressed.
Hence flatulency and indigestion arise, which is soon follow-
ed by bad concocted chyle, which gradually debilitates the
system, and is followed by glandular affections, easily observ-
ed in the large bellies of children, owing to the mesenteric
glands being obstructed.  Other serophulous symptoms gra-
dually succeed, and tubercles being formed in the lungs, ul-
timately produce consumptions.  The same causes, which ex-
cite pulmonary affections in the young, lay the foundation
for visceral obstructions in the more advanced in life.  This

complaints.  In 27 deaths (the number reported for the
year) 18 died of these diseases; and without doubt there were
many more, whose deaths not being intimated to the gover-
nor, could not be published in the statement.

   Excepting diseases peculiar to children, epidemics seldom
or never prevail in Kelso.  About 4 years ago, a putrid fe-
ver was introduced by a patient from the country; it spread,
