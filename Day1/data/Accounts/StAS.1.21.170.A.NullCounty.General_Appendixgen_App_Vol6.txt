tain the latter, a canal was formed, extending almost 3 miles
through the centre of the moss.  From place to place along
the sides are inserted sluices to admit water to the reservoirs
of the possessors; each sluice having an aperture proportion-
ed to the number of operators to be supplied from the reser-
voir which it fills.  For the water raised through the day no
reservoirs are are necessary; as it is immediately used by the di-
vision to which it is allotted.
   This additional stream, though highly beneficial, yet is not
more than sufficient to keep 40 men at constant work.  But
such a quantity as would give constant work is not necessa-
ry; the operators must be often employed in making and re-
pairing their drains, grubbing up roots of trees, etc.; so that
a quantity sufficient to give five or six hours work per day to
the whole inhabitants is as much as would be wanted.  But
as the quantity procured was still insufficient for this pur-
pose, a small stream that descended from the higher grounds
was diverted from its course and brought into the moss.
From want of level this stream could not be delivered to the
greatest advantage; namely, upon the surface of the moss.
Yet by making, at a considerable expence, a drain half a mile
long, and a reservoir for the night-water, it was rendered of
much importance.  And during the whole winter months, as
well as in summer, after every fall of rain, it keeps 15 per-
sons fully employed.
   In the year 1787 two more tenants agreed for eight acres
each; in 1788, four; in 1789, eight; in 1790, four tenants,
all agreed for the same number of acres.
   The whole moss was now disposed of except that part call-
ed Flow-moss, which comprehended about 400 acres.  Here it
is twice the usual breadth, so fluid that a pole may be thrust
with.  One hand to the bottom; and the interior part, for
near a mile broad, is three feet above the level of all the rest
