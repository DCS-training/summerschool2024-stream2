of both charges.  The stipend, annexed to the first, consists
of 8 1/2 chalders of meal and grain, and about 25 L. in money,
with a small glebe.  Of the grain and meal, there are only
paid, within the parish of Cupar, 19 bolls.  The stipend of
the second minister is about 1000 L. Scotch.  There is no
manse belonging to either of the ministers.

   Religious Persuasions.-Till within these few months there
has always been an Episcopal meeting-house in Cupar, having a
fixed pastor residing in the town, or in the immediate vici-
nity.  At present the people Of that persuasion who are
now reduced to a very small number assemble for public
worship only occasionally, when the Episcopal minister from
Pittenweem presides.  The sect of Relief have a meeting-
house in Cupar, built in 1769.  The number of membership
the parish, belonging to this congregation cannot easily be
ascertained, as they are in a state of constant instruction.
There arc also a few Burghes and Auhburghers who be-
long to the congregations who meet at Ceres and Rathvilet.
About 7 or 8 persons assemble on the Lord's, Day in a
private house in town, for the purposes of devotion; but
their principles and mode of worship are not known-It is
pleasant to conclude this detail of the religious persuasions
which prevail in this place with remarking, that the secta-
ries in Cupar live on good terms with their neighbours the
members of the Established Church;-that their different opi-
nions in religion seldom interrupt the social intercourse of
life, or prevent them from doing kind offices to one another
-that a more liberal and benevolent spirit begins at last to
prevail; and that, except among a few, that gloominess of
aspect, that bitterness of spirit, and that fierceness of zeal,
which in former times marked and disgraced the different
fects, are, at the present day, happily unknown.
