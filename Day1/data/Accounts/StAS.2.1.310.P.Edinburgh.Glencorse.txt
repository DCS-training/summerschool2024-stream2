                   PARISH OF GLENCROSS.

        PRESBYTERY OF DALKEITH, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN & TWEEDDALE.

           THE REV.  ALEXANDER TORRENCE, MINISTER.

         I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-GLENCROSS, or Glencorse, as it is now very generally
written, according to Chalmers in his Caledonia, derives its name
"from a remarkable cross which had once been erected in the
vale of Glencross by pious hands, and which also gave the name

   Extent, Boundaries, &c.-The parish forms nearly a square,
extending about three miles. It is bounded on the east and south,

considerable height, and forms a striking contrast to that which
has been now described. From the high grounds at the foot, of
the hills, the view is of the most commanding description, extend-

hill grounds afford excellent pasture for sheep, and are well supplied

highest in the parish, is 1403 feet above the level of the sea.

from the manse, rises the Crawley spring, from which Edinburgh
