     of Stronsay and Eday.

   There are, exclusive of Lord Dundas, thirteen heritors, of
whom six have a large extent, and seven have a small extent
of property lying in this district.  There are no residing heri-
tors except the heirs of Patrick Fea of Kerbuster, whose pro-
perty, at his decease, fell to be divided equally amongst his
three daughters.

   State of Population, Parochial Records, etc.-The ancient
state of the parish of Eday cannot now be ascertained with
exactness, as records of an old date for that parish are not to
be found.  Records for the parish of Stronsay, from the year
1673 and downwards, with chasms of several years at differ-
ent periods, in a decayed state, as may be supposed, are yet
in existence.
   From these it appears, that during a period of 20 years
subsequent to 1673, the number of baptisms in the parish of
Stronsay was 382, of marriages 109.  That during 20 years
subsequent to 1743, the number of baptisms was 601, viz. of
males 309, of females 292.
   In the united parishes of Stronsay and Eday, during a pe-
riod of 14 years subsequent to 1779, when the present in-
cumbent was admitted, the numbers of baptisms, marriages,
and burials, in the separate years of that period were as fol-
low:
