clean furrow to their last year's barley-ground, for oats,
which are begun to be sown the 28 the of March, and finish-
ed the 5 th of April; then they begin to spread their dung,
and give a clean furrow to their barley-ground; a third fur-
row precedes the sowing of the barley; begun the 8 the May,
and finished towards the conclusion of that month.
   The harvest, in indulgent seasons, begins 10 th Septem-
ber, and ends about the last days of October.  The common
mode of preparing their dung for barley, is one half dung,
and the other half mortar, but more frequently land.
   The better sort of tenants have ploughs of the English
construction, drawn by a couple of horses; others are the
old Scots plough, drawn by 6 or 8 oxen, where the ground
is stony and of hard culture.  The former makes use of
box-carts, and the latter of kellocks, for conveying the
compost which they use for manure.  The kellock is of a co-

which furnishes employment to some of the labouring
poor.  It is suspended by two shafts, in which a single horse
is placed, and set on a clumsy two-wheeled carriage.  The
kellock is in value 1 s. and slider and wheels 4 s.  The
common rotation of crops after breaking up the grass-field
is, 1 st, Two of oats, in succession; 2 d, Barley; 3 d, Oats

The labouring cattle are weak and starving in the spring,
for want of fodder, and are fed on straw.  They are thus
often under the necessity of sending their cattle to the High-
lands in summer, whence they return in as wretched a con-
dition as they are sent.  Potatoes, forming the subsistence
of the people one-third of the year, are planted by every
