have perfectly the appearance of Carton grates; In the
upper part of the parish, there is plenty of good limestone,
Two of the proprietors have draw-kilns, which are kept
going for a considerable part of the year, to answer the or-
dinary demand of lime for building, and especially for ma-
nure, which is purchased by their own tenants, and by the
farmers of the country westward along the shore, where
there is none of it.  Notwithstanding this abundances a small
quantity of Irish limestone is imported at Saltcoats, as ballast,
in the coal ships.  The lime made of it is whiter than the
Scots, and answers better for plaister-work, and for casting
of houses and walls.

   Saltcoats.-The principal object worthy of attention in
this parish is the town of Saltcoats, and the coal-mines in its
neighbourhood, which have furnished an article of exporta-
tion from that town to Ireland for near a century back.
The town is singularly situated, on the limits of the two pa-
rishes of Stevenston and Ardrossan, and almost equally die
vided between them.  There were leases of houses and gar-
dens granted to a few families as long ago as the year 1565.
But it is certain, from unquestionable traditionary testimony
(that of parents to their children now living) that a century
after that times or about 130 years ago, there were only
four houses in Saltcoats, which now consists of about 400.
Yet at a much remoter period, salt mas made there; which
appears not only from tradition, but from the remains of
considerable heaps of ashes south and north of the present
town.  It was then made by poor people, in their little pans
or kettles.  They digged up the coal near the surface of the
ground, at a very small expences and lived in huts on the
shore.  Hence, probably, the name of Saltcotes or Cottages.
