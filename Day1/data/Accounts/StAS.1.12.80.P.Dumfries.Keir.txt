     Statistical Account

   About 6 years ago, a lime rock was discovered in the
estate of Barjarg, and from that time has been carried on
with considerable success.  The rock seems to be inexhausti-
ble, but has about 14 feet deep of the earth above it; the remov-
ing of which is attended with no small expense.  Between 30
and 40 hands are constantly employed for 7 or 8 months in
the year, when they continue to burn lime; but not so many
during the rest of the year.  Between 20,000 and 30,000
measures, in shells, have been sold annually; the measure, as
before observed, containing 2 Winchester bushels.  It is sold
at 9 d. the measure, and as the lime is of an excellent qua-
lity, it is not improbable that the demand for it will in-
crease.

   Character of the People, etc.-The people, in general, are
sober and industrious, though it must be confessed, that, since
the pernicious practice of drinking whisky became so pre-
valent, there are too many exceptions.  They enjoy, in a
reasonable degree, the necessaries, and even the comforts and
conveniencies of life, and are, generally, as contented with
their situation, as most people.  Their condition, however,
might be meliorated, were our roads put into proper repair,
the duty on the English coal abolished, the inhabitants bet-
ter supplied with coal from Sanquhar, and the heavy mul-
tures, which they are bound to pay to the mills to which
they are thirled, removed.  More than one-half of the pa-
rish pays the eleventh peck as multure, besides paying the
miller for working or grinding their grain.  This is cer-
tainly a very great discouragement to improvements in agri-
culture.
