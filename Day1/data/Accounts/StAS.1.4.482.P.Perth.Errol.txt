   Agriculture.-The mode of cultivation has undergone
an entire revolution within these 40 years, and, as this
parish is an important part of the carse of Gowrie, that
article is the more deserving of notice.  The land was for-
merly divided into what was called infield and outfield,
there being about two-thirds of the former, and a third of
the latter.  The infield, which generally lay next the vil-
lage or tenement, got the dung produced on the farm, and
was kept under a constant rotation of peas, wheat, barley
and oats; lime, fallow and artificial grasses, were almost
unknown.  The outfield, after remaining 6 years in its 
natural state, was for 3 crops turned into oats, having
been previously thrown up into dikes as a preparation for
them; after which it was allowed to revert to its former
condition.  The produce of every kind was very indiffe-

in summer upon thistles, which were to be had in abun-

which it was the employment of the servants to collect.
The land is at present in a high state of improvement.
As almost the  whole parish is capable of bearing the same
grain, the farmers, like impartial stewards, direct their at-
tention equally to every part of their charge, and divide
their possession into 6 equal portions, which they employ
for fallow, wheat, peas, barley, grass and oats.  The fal-
low which succeeds the oats or wheat, is turned over in
the end of autumn, again in the beginning of summer,
and commonly ploughed and harrowed other 3 times in
the course of it.  It is always enriched with dung, and
frequently with lime, which are laid on it before it gets
the last surrow in August.-The wheat upon the fallow
is sown from the 8th to the last of September.  As this is 
the principal crop which recompences the toil and ex-
