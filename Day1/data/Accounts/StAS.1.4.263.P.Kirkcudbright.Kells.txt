lead mine on Sir William Miller's estate, has never been
wrought to any extent.  Within half a mile of it, on the
same estate, is the appearance of a  copper mine.  Some 
miners, about 12 years ago, passing from Leadhills to Min-
nigrass, observed it, and wrought some days for a trial; and
finding the appearance promising, whished to take a tack of
it; but disagreeing with the landlord about the terms, it
has been neglected ever since.  Near the Kenmore, 2 miles
further S. there is an appearance of lead.  Pieces of the
ore have been dug up almost on the surface.  Both these
are probably a part of the same strata of lead, wrought
with so much advantage at Minnigass, 18 miles S. W. of
this and might perhaps be wrought with equal profit here.

   Animals.-Foxes, hares, wild cats and badgers, find ex-
cellent cover in our woods; otters in the banks of our ri-
vers; of those last, our sportmen, in time of trost, destroy 
great numbers.  There is plenty of black and red game
in our moors.  Partridged are not so numerous as in more
corn countries.  Tarmagants are on our high hills.  Plover
and snipe in low and marshy lands.  Eagles of a large
size build on the tops of precipices and high rocks.  One
killed lately, measured from the tips of the wings 7 feet.
Swallows and cuckoos make their appearance about the
beginning of April; wood-cocks in the latter end of har-
vest, when the weather begins to be cold.  In a hard win-
ter, stocks of geese and swans come to Loch Ken; wild
ducks and there in great abundance at all sea-
sons.

   Population.-At the time of Dr Webster's report, the
numbers were 784.  For 10 years past, the average has
been, marriages 6; births 13.  Inhabited houses are at
present 180; 73 of which are in the town of New Gal-
