tain finches, and the goatsucker, or night swallow.  In the
hedges, common and hdge sparrows.  In the woods, the
buzzard, sparrow-hawk, jay, magpie, crow, ring-dove, of
which there are great numbers, cuckoo; a young cuckoo
was seen at the head of Monk's Burn, flying after a titlark,
from which it got the signals when to keep out of danger,
by following his guardian and guide; it was also frequently
observed feeding him, when the little nurse, to get at his
mouth, generally leapt on his back, and made him turn
round his head, which was as big as the other's whole body.
The crossbill, attracted by the cones of the spruce, the plates
of which, to get at the seed, are found in numbers folded
back with great dexterity; the bullfinch, stirling, thrush,
blackbird, redbreast, linnet, all the finches, and titmice, in-
cluding the blue and the long tailed one, also a very small
and beautiful bird, the creeper, like a little mouse running
up the trees for insects; the yellow, common and golden
crested wrens; the swallows about the house, in summer, and
in the woods, at nights, the owl, horned and smooth.  In
1784, a hoopoe was shot by a gentleman, in coming here
from the Whim, in the Parish of Newlands, a little to the
south.

quested to be added: After the word describo, page 618, line
