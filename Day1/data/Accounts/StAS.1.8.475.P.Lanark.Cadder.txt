     of Cadder.

   River and Canal.-The river Kelvin, which rises east of
Kilsyth, runs 6 miles along the northern boundary of the pa-
rish; but its course may be 10 or 12 miles, through fine fer-
tile haugh grounds.  It falls into the river Clyde two miles
below Glasgow.  The Kelvin used to overflow its banks in
time of rain, and do considerable damage, especially in seed
time and harvest; but the proprietors on the north side, to
whom it did most damage, have of late confined it, by a
great earthen mound, for the most part along its course.-It
might, however, have been a much more effectual remedy, had
they straightened, widened, and secured the bed of the river;
which would be a great saving of ground.-The Forth and
Clyde Navigation, commonly called the Great Canal, runs
through the parish for 5 miles, and has 4 draw bridges on it.

   Lakes and Roads.-About 80 years ago, a lake, nearly in
the middle of the parish, was drained by a mine, driven a
full mile in length under a hill.  The mine is in many places
90 feet below the surface, whereby 120 acres of fine arable
ground is gained, which annually produces rich crops, without
any kind of manure.-There is another lake, called the Bishop's
Loch, a mile in length, and one fourth of a mile in breadth,
which is at present occupied as a reservoir, by the Great Canal
Company.-The post road, from Edinburgh to Glasgow, passes
4 miles through this parish, and crosses the Great Canal about
a mile east of Cadder kirk.  There is also a new turnpike road
made for 4 miles, in the east end of this parish, from Glas-
gow by Cumbernauld towards Falkirk, said to be considerably
shorter than the road by Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch, and with-
out a pull.-In 1772, when the heritors met to assess the
parish for repairing the bye roads, they found it to con-
tain 123 ploughgates of land.  They assessed each of these
ploughgates in 10 s. Sterling, and 1 s. 6 d. for every cottager,
