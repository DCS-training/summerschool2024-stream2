These are frequently such as to render the drainage of the fields
worse than useless, as the water can no longer find its way for want
of level, and occasions a stagnation which it costs both trouble and
expense to remedy. In general, however, the surface resumes its
relative position at a somewhat lower elevation, exhibiting the
astonishing effects that may be produced by the labours of man,
for thus no inconsiderable part of the parish, at a depth of from
50 to 80 fathoms, has by these workings, at three several distances
been undermined, and let down by separate stages to rest perma-
nently at a lower elevation than it originally occupied.
   Produce.-The following is an approximation to the average
gross amount of raw produce raised in the parish. The prices
of grain are the average fair prices for the last seven years.

   To the above there ought perhaps to have been added the
straw, which is regularly disposed of; but this is held by the far-
mers to be a set-off against the manure, which, in consequence,
they have to purchase, instead of making it, by having the straw
consumed by live stock, and no return of it has been received.
                   V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Dalkeith is the nearest market-town, which is distant about two
miles, and Edinburgh five from the centre of the parish.
   Villages.-There are four principal and two smaller villages
connected with the coal-works; and Edmonstone and Woolmet,
which, from their contiguous position, may be considered as one,
is the only village inhabited by the agricultural classes and trades-
men.
   Means of Communication.-The means of communication en-
joyed by the parish are most ample. The turnpike from Edin-
burgh to Lauder, &c. by Dalkeith passes along the west side of
it, while it is intersected in its whole extent by that from Leith
