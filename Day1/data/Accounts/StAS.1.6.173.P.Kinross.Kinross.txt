tentment is to be enjoyed, and possess all the necessaries and
many of the comforts of life, each, till of late, continued to
pursue the course followed by their fathers and grandfathers:
but now, that a different mode of living universally prevails,
a spirit of industry and a taste for improvement are roused, and
every one is endeavouring to make his farm turn to the best ac-
count; and, in order to excite emulation among the servants,
a ploughing match was held in March last, at Turf-hills, a lit-
tle to the west of this town, where prizes were adjudged to
those who excelled, according to their merit; being the first of
the kind in this parish.-The ploughs now used are for the
most part of an improved construction.-The principal crops
are oats and barley.  Considerable attention has, of late, been
paid to the cultivation of turnips; and potatoes are a general
crop in every part of the parish.  Much flax is raised both for
the market and for private use; and great quantities of clover
and rye-grass are sown, on account of the demand for hay
from the public inns, stablers, horse-hirers, and carters.  Lit-
tle or no wheat was raised till of late, but it is now sown in
different parts of the parish.
