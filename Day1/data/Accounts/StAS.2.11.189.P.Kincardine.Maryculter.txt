		FRESBYTERY OF ABERDEEN, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

	            THE REV. JOHN BOWER, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPORAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--As noted in the former Statistical Account, the ori-
ginal orthography of this parish seems to have been Marice cultura. *
	Extent, &c.--It is of an oblong form, 6 English miles in length
and 2 in breadth, extending from the river Dee to the Grampian
Mountains.
	Soil.--Soil on the river side is naturally thin and sandy; on
the rising midland, it becomes deeper and blacker, with a bottom
of clay in some parts; and more southward, the ground turns
swampy, turfy, and mossy. The extremities of the parish are in
some places rocky hills and mosses; in others, green hills with
large stones, rushy moors, and heath. Indeed the whole district
is rocky and  stony, except some small haughs and dales on the
river side. Much of the parish is thin ground and recumbent, as

<FOOTNOTE>At the same time it may be observed, that an envient Gaelle scholar states that      that
Cultura means "the back of the land."
