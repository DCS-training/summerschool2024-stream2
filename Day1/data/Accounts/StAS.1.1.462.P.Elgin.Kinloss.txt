     NUMBER XLVIII.

     PARISH OF KINLOSS.

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN HOYES.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, etc.

   THE antient and modern name of this parish is Kinloss,
derived from Kain, a Head, and Loch; i.e. the Head
of the Loch; Kinloss being situated on the head of the Bay
of Findhorn.  This parish is in the shire of Elgin and Forres;
in the presbytery of Forres, and synod of Moray.  It is of a
square form, being between three and four miles long and
broad.  It is bounded on the east by the parish of Alves; on
the south and south-west by Rafford and Forres; and on the
north by the Moray Firth.  It is a very flat level country.
The soil is various; in some places light and sandy; in others
a rich and deep clay, moss, and loam, make up a considerable
part of the soil; and all of it, when well managed, produces
good crops of grain of every kind.  This parish, being flat,
is but poorly supplied with good water; and most of the
springs taste of minerals.  The shore is flat and sandy.  The
fish caught here are mostly haddocks and whittings, and, in
the season, cod, skate, and ling, which are all sold in the
country, and at Forres, at about 1 d. or 1 1/2 d. a pound.
