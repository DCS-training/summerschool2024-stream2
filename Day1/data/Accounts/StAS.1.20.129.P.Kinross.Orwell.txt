   Population.-The population of this parish has certainly
increased of late.  The number of children born, communi-
bus annis, about 120; but, owing to the negligence of the
parents, in not registrating their childrens births, an accurate
list cannot be obtained.  They seem to have paid more at-
tention to this the end of last century than they do at pre-
sent.-The population in 1755, was 1891 souls.
