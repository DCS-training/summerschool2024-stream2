     of Dumfries.

   Poor.-There are at least 150 poor persons who receive
alms from the public funds.  From 45 to 50 are supported
in a poor's house, established in the town.  Such as chuse to
go about begging, are supplied with badges to distinguish
them as the only mendicant poor belonging to the town; a
precaution which, however, does not hinder it from being
insested with numerous vagrant beggars.  The whole funds
for the maintenance of the poor, whether arising from col-
lections or mortifications, amount to nearly L. 400 a-year.
The infirmary has already been taken notice of.

   Population.-From the circumstance already mentioned
respecting the town and parish, it will naturally be inferred,
that the population cannot be considerable.  In a sort of
conjuct act of the town and the presbytery, dated in 1727,
the examinable persons in the town alone, of the age of 10
years and upwards, are stated at 2030.  Since that period,
this number has been greatly augmented.  In 1755, the
number of souls, as returned to Dr Webster, was 4517.
The present population of the town, as appears from an e-
numeration lately taken, may be fairly estimated at 5600
souls.  The inhabitants of the country part of the parish
are 1400; total 7000 souls; so that the increase within these
35 years amounts to 2483 souls.  The number of seperate
families in the town, is from 1400 to 1500.  The families
in the country are somewhat above 300.  The numbers of
the different incorporated trades in the town are respective-
ly as follows:
