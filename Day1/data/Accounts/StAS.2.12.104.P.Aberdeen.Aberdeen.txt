       	Gordon's Hospital, with the additions lately made to it, forms a
highly ornamental building.
      	The Court House, which was erected in 1818, from a plan by
J. Smith, Esq. is commodious; but, from its situation, it is com-
pletely hid, as is also the prison, which lies behind it, and which
was built in 1830.
       	The County Rooms were erected in 1820, on a plan given by
A. Simpson, Esq., and form one of the most striking ornaments
of the principal street.
       	The North Church was planned by J. Smith, Esq., is an elegant
building, and forms a very conspicuous ornament in King Street.
  	The Lunatic Asylum and the Infirmary, both planned by A.
Simpson, Esq., are exceedingly handsome buildings, especially the
latter.
       	The East Church, an elegant building in the Gothic style, was
planned by A. Simpson, Esq.
      	The Bridge in Union Street, over the valley in which the
Denburn run, is a very elegant structure, shewing a single arch
whose span is 132 feet, and the height to the top of the parapet
56 feet.
       	The Cross is an elegant octagonal structure, having a column
rising trom the centre surmounted by a unicorn bearing a shield,
and surrounded with medallions of the monarchs of Scotland from
James I. to James VI. It is remarkable as having been the work
of a stone-mason, from the village of Old Rayne.
       	The Orphan Hospital, just finished, is, a handsome building,
without any superfluous ornament.
      	Marischal College is not yet finished, but is fast advancing, and
when completed will be both commodious and ornamental; but it
is not well situated, being much hemmed in by the surrounding
buildings.

       	December 1839.

       	N. B.--An account of the Universities of Aberdeen will be qiven
along with the General Observations on the County.
