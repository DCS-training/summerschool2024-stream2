here in great abundance.  Between 45 and 50 tons of kelp
are manufactured annually.  The flood-tide invariably runs
from south to north, both on the shore and at sea, and of
course, the ebb-tide in the contrary direction.  Loch Sea-
forth , Lochshell, and Locherifort, are the principal harbours.
Across the entry of each of the two latter, there is an island,
which makes them secure retreats for vessels in all kinds of
weather.  In the channel between Lewis and Sky, a third 
of the way nearer the former than the latter, are three
islands, named Shaint of Holy Islands, well known to ma-

has been so unfortunate as to lose, at different times, his
wife, a son, and a daughter, by falling down great preci-
pices; the mother and son met with this catastrophe in fol-

the two principal headlands on the coast.  Most of the parish 
is covered with heath.
