   Poor.-The average of stated pensioners on the poor's roll,
for the last 10 years, is 14.  The expenditure on these, in-
cluding occasional supplies to others, and the salaries of session
clerks, precentor, beadle, synod and presbytery clerks, and
presbytery officer, amounts, at an average, to 42 L. per annum.
The money at present in the kirk treasurer's hands, is a mere

this slock, a set of mortcloths, the use of which was given,
gratis, to the contributors.  The body carters, who have a
fund of the same kind, within these 2 or 3 years, followed
their example.  As the great body of the parish consists of
these two descriptions of people, the kirk-session foresaw, that
this practice, if allowed to continue, would soon go nearly to
extinguish altogether the funds arising from the use of the pa-
rish mortcloths.  They communicated their ideas on this cir-

to concur with the kirk-session in trying the point of law on
this subject, and to defray the whole expence that should be
incurred on this occasion.  The neighbouring parish of Liber-
