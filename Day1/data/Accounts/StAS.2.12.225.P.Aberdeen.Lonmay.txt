   Character of the People.-The habits of the people are quiet, or-
derly, and industrious.  Their meals are frugal in the extreme, con
sisting almost wholly of farinaceous food, milk, potatoes, greens,
&c.  Fish are, however, occasionally used, especially skate, and
at the approach of winter, a fat small-sized ox or heifer (often of
the Shetland breed, bought for the purpose,) is not unfrequent-
ly shared between three or four families.  Undoubtedly the people
are disposed to be content and satisfied with a very moderate sup-
ply of the humbler comforts of life ; but for some years past, diffi-
culties have increased in the way of their procurement.  There is
little or no capital left amongst them, owing to the deterioration of
the value of agricultural produce, including cattle, and which is
wholly disproportioned to any reduction which has taken place in
the cost of rent, labour, and other farm charges and expense of ne-
cessary articles of consumption.  Depression of circumstances has
more and more prevailed in the case of those who were moderate-
ly provided with the means of life, and the reduced state of each
class acting disadvantageously on its inferior, has occasioned the in-
crease of poverty to be felt in rather an alarming manner, so that
