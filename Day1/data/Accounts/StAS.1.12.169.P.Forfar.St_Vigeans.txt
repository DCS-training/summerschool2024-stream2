side in the parish.  One heritor keeps a 2 wheeled carriage;
but there is not a 4 wheeled chaise belonging to any heritor
residing.  Most of the estates in this parish belonged former-
ly to the Abbacy of Arbroath, and were sold by Cardinal
Beaton.

   Soil, etc.-The soil, as may be supposed in such an extent,
varies very much.  In some parts of the parish, it consists of
fine loam of a brownish colour, many inches deep; lying, in
some places, on clay, in others, on a sandy bottom, coarse
gravel, or sand and clay intermixed.  In others, it consists of
a black insipid loam on clay; and this clay, in some place, is
so compact and impenetrable, that by the rain-water lying on
or near the surface, a great part of the winter, the manure
laid on it is much weakened, and, in some seasons, fails con-
siderably of its effect.  This last, is the case with what has
been formerly moor, and not so early brought into cultiva-
tion as other parts of the parish.  There is, in some places of
the parish, very fine soil, and pretty deep, lying on extensive
beds of stone.  There is, in general, a large extent of good
soil, capable of producing any crop raised in Scotland; and
also, a considerable quantity of ground that will require no
little attention and industry from the farmer, before it can
repay the expense bestowed upon it.  But the spirit of in-
dustry that has of late pervaded almost the whole heritors
and tenants here, has produced on amazing alteration upon
the soil, surface, and appearance of the parish; so that in
many farms, there is not a single acre uncultivated; and if
the same spirit shall continue, it is supposed, that in a few
years the whole extent of the parish will be under cultiva-
tion.  It is generally allowed here, that the raising of the
rents in this district, has, among other causes, contributed to
the activity, attention, and industry of the farmers, who have
