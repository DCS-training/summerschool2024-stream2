loses its excellence.  It again rises somewhat towards the
N. W. point of the parish, and shews to the eye of the
traveller spots yet morrish and waste.

   Hills.-Of these some may deserve notice.  The high-
est and most remarkable, is the most southern of that
collecton of hills called Laws, in the vicinity of the vil-
lage of Drumsturdy-moor.  Its height has not been ascer-
tained by measurement; but is supposed not much to ex-
ceed 530 feet above the level of the sea.  It lies from E.
to W. is of an oval figure, and is covered with a pleasant
verdure; its summit is 133 yards in length, 66 yards in

city Dundee, part of the fertile carse of Gowrie, and al-

the distant prospect is bounded by the mountains in the
shire of Argyle.  South and eastward may be seen the bay
of St Andrew's, the hills of Lothian, the agreeably varied
country to Arbroath, and the German Ocean to the ut-
most extent of the horizon.  Around the summit of this
hill, are to be seen the broad foundations of an ancient
fortress; and on the E. end of it, several large vitrifica-
tions, or masses of sandy and whin-stones firmly united,
by means of the fusion of certain parts of the whin-stones*.

*These vitrifications have plainly been caused, by the application of
external fire; as small pieces of burns wood are found in the heart of the
masses when they are broken.  But the question occurs, how was this
fire applied, so as to vitrify these masses?  One ingenious gentleman has
conjectured, that before the use of lime, as a cement, was introduced
by the Romans into the island, whoever wisbed to strengthen their forts,
