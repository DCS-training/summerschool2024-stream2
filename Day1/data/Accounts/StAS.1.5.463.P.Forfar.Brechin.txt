Auchindown, who was of the Queen's party, and was be-

Another battle was fought in this neighbourhood, between
the Earls of Crawford and Huntly, on the 18th May
1452, when the former was defeated, and the latter did

ed The Battle of Brechin, though the spot, on which it was
fought, is not in the parish, but a little to the N. E. of it,
on the road leading to the North Water Bridge.
