   Church and School.-At what time the churches of Forbes
and Kearn were built, no person living knows.  They are at
present in bad repair; and, at the death of the present incum-
bent, the parishes are to be annexed to Auchendoir and Til-
linessle.  The manse was built about 70 years ago, and has
got many partial repairs since, but is still a mean habitation.
The stipend is 22 L. Sterling, including 4 L. Scotch for com-

a school themselves, or kept a boy for educating their own
children, and admitted the children in the neighbourhood to
partake of the benefit.  The present incumbent applied for a
school 4 years ago; but the application was unsuccessful.

   Poor.-Before the year 1782, the funds for the poor were
only about 30 L. Sterling, besides the ordinary collections, which
scarcely amount to 2 l. Sterling per annum.  But in 1782-
the said funds were totally exhausted; and therefore no pen-

where it is absolutely necessary.  No poor's rates have yet
taken place in this country.  In the years 1782 and 1783, by
the activity of the session, partly by the foresaid funds, and
partly by the government's gratuity, together with the use of
private money, the poor in this district were equally well sup-
