	   Buildinqs.-The houses of Forglen and Carnousie are ancient;
	the oldest part of the former being built about 1440, as appears
	from the arms and cypher on an old stone.  The church, the pa-
	rochial and female school-houses are modern buildings.  There
	are two mills in the parish, originally erected for the accommoda-
	tion of the tenants of Forglen and Carnousie.  The materials em-
	ployed for building are the stones already mentioned as common.
	Sometimes, however, granite and red sandstone are used, which
	are brought from the neighbouring parishes:
