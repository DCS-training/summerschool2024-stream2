ner; on the east, by the parishes of Orwell and Kinross;
on the south, by Cliesh and Saline; on the west, by Clack-
mannan, Dollar, Muckart, and Glen-dovan; and on the
north, by the parish of Dunning.
   A map of the parish of Fossaway, as forming a part of the
county of Perth, has been drawn by Mr Stobie, factor to the
Duke of Atholl; and a map of Tulliebole, in conjunction
with the county of Kinross, by Mr John Bell, land-surveyor
at Edinburgh.  Both these maps are executed with accuracy,
in as far as they regard the two parishes; but it is not known to
the writer of this account, if they have ascertained the num-
ber of acres contained in them.  Though both the maps are
executed with precision, they differ from the description
which is given here.  The reason is this, above a century ago,
the barony of Carnboe, in the northern part of the parish of
Fossaway, was, by an Act of Parliament, disjoined from the
county of Perth, and annexed to the county of Kinross.  It
is still considered, as belonging to the parish of Fossaway;
but is of course, omitted in the map of the county of Perth,
and comprehended in Mr Bell's map of Kinross-shire.
   By the Act of Parliament lately passed for raising men for
his Majesty's Navy out of every county, the whole of the
parish of Fossaway is joined with the county of Kinross.
This naturally leads to the following observation; that it
would be more convenient for Fossaway, if it were for ever
annexed to Kinross.  The distance from Kinross, is only 6
miles of fine road; the distance from Perth, is 21 miles
over the Ochil hills.  To be obliged to go to Perth for all the
business which must be transacted there, is attended with a
very considerable degree both of trouble and expence.  There
is not a residing Justice of the Peace in the whole parish of
Fossaway.  If it were united to Kinross-shire, it would be
