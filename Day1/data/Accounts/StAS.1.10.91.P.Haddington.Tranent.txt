<FOOTNOTE>

*A very accurate register was kept of the births and buri-
als of the parishioners until the year 1784, when the tax upon
recording them was imposed, which many persons refused to
pay, and therefore omitted making any entry.  The record,
consequently, became imperfect in this, as well as in many other
parishes in Scotland.
The register before mentioned contains all the deaths of pa-
rishioners, though buried in a different parish, all included in
the following tables: it likewise contains the deaths of a consi-
derable number dying in adjacent parishes, and buried in Tra-
nent, and children at nurse sent from other places; but these
are not included in the tables.
