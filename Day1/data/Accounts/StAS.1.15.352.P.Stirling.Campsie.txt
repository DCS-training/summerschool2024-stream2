great branches, as the farther improvement of the district
shall suggest; one of which improvements is evident to the
most careless observer; viz. in cutting a line of road from
Campsie kirk to the Crow road, the distance is not much
more than 600 yards, and yet to the people who travel to
Stirling from this part of the county, it must shorten the
road fully 3 miles.
   Considering that the roads were made upon no determin-
ed plan, but sometimes altering and mending the old lines,
as circumstances occurred, it is wonderful, that in a district
where the ground is so uneven, and particularly when it is
considered that one of the roads crosses part of a mountain
800 feet high, that there should be so few pulls in it; seldom
or ever is the rise more sudden than that of one foot in 20ll.

llAs sometimes it hath been proposed to carry a turnpike road from
Kilsyth to the military road near Buchanan house, the seat of the Duke of

bridge was thrown over the Leven, at the boat of Ballach, there cannot be
the smallest doubt, that the great line of travelling from the West Highlands
to Edinburgh, must be through the valley of Campsie, it being much nearer
than either by Glasgow or Stirling: (since writing this account, a bill has
passed, qualifying the heritors of Stirlingshire to carry this East and West di-
rection through the valley of Fintray, to the North of Campsie hills, and
through the valley on the river Blane.  It may not be improper to observe
here, that the people who grumble most in paying money instead of the statute
labour, are the cottars and tradesmen; and yet they are the greatest gainers:
They don't recollect, that wherever good roads exist, raw materials are easily
imported, and manufactured articles have ready access to the market: such
local advantages, along with the circumstance of cheap fuel, have been the
great reasons of encouraging manufacturers to settle amongst us: the truth
is, the public, or the trustees for the public, may be said to have made a
bad bargain when they agreed (as the act of Parliament expresses)to
receive two shillings from a cottar in lieu of four days labour, although
