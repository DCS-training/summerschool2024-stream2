   Miscellaneous Observations.-This parish possesses no advan-
tage.  The nearest market town is 15 miles distant.  The
roads to all of them are almost impassable.  The only road
that looks like a turnpike is to Selkirk; but even it in many
places is so deep, as greatly to obstruct travelling.  The dis-
tance is about 16 miles, and it requires four hours to ride it.
The snow also, at times, is a great inconvenience; often for
many months, we can have no intercourse with man-
kind.  It often also obliges the farmers to fly with their
flocks to Annandale for provision.  Another great disadvan-
tage is the want of bridges.  For many hours the traveller is
obstructed on his journey, when the waters are swelled.
The land rent of the parish is between L. 2000 and L. 3000
Sterling, per annum.  The value of the living, including the
glebe, is L. 100 per annum.  Lord Napier is patron.  There
are 10 proprietors of land is this parish:  none of them re-
side in it.  The number of persons, receiving alms, at this
time, is 15.  The assessments upon the heritors for their sup-
port, amount to L. 37 Sterling, per annum.  The fuel used
here is peat.  Coal is distant 30 miles.  In this parish
there are 12 ploughs, and 20 carts, but no carriages or
waggons.
