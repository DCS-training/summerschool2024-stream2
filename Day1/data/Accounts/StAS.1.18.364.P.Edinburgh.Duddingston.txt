The estate was thus reduced into a regular and progressive
state of cultivation; and the country beautified and adorned
with hedge-rows, clumps, and plantations of various forms
and extent.  Though the rents comparatively have been
greatly advanced, in consequence of these improvements;
the tenants are all thriving, live comfortably, and perhaps
are in every respect, in a better condition than their prede-
cessors; some of whom only paid at the rate of 5 s per acre
for the arable land of an inferior quality, with an interest in
the commons, for which no rent was demanded.  Prior to
the year 1746, the medium rent of land in the parish was
about 10 s for the computed acre, now it is about L. 2: 2.
In 1763, soon after the Earl had compleated the subdividing
and enclosing of his estate, he began to build his mansion
house of Dudingston, upon an elegant and commodious plan,
the work of the late Sir William Chalmers.  The house and
offices were finished in 1768; and continue to exhibit a beau-
tiful specimen of Greek architecture and elegance, and of
English accommodation and affluence.  The noble villa was
surrounded with shrubbery, pleasure grounds, canals, gar-
dens; and in the formation of the whole, it is supposed, above
L. 30,000 sterling, were expended.  The beautiful variety
of the ground, the happy position of the clumps and groves,
the striking diversity of the water embellishments, canals,
lakes, isles, and cascades; and above all, the grandeur and
beauty of the surrounding scenery and prospects, independ-
ently of the magnificent form and architecture of the house
itself, must ever render the place singularly picturesque, ele-
gant and attracting.
