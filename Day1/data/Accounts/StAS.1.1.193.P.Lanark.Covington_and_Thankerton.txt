nearly resembling the former.  In this place a large mound
of earth is erected.  This was probably a sheriff's court, where,
on a certain day, the adjacent country attended to have jus-
tice done.  The name of the adjacent farm seems to favour
this tradition, for it is called Sheriff flats.  According to im-
memorial tradition, a bullock's skin full of gold lies buried in
this place.  Covington was formerly the seat of a knight ba-
ronet named Lindsey:  In 1420, the laird applied, and ob-
tained leave from parliament to build a sort, which was finish-
ed in 1442.  The walls are 10 feet thick.  It was made
strong by every circumstance that art could invent.  An old
sword of very large size, called Wallace's, is still preserved.
The ruin continues a grand and majestic object.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The fuel used here is coal.  The
distance from the coal hill is about 9 miles:  The price there
is 3 d per cwt.  When laid down here, the price is nearly
doubled.  There is one village called Thankerton, beauti-
fully situated on the river Clyde.  There is a bridge over the
Clyde at this village, built in 1778 by public contribution.  It
is kept in repair by the county.  The roads are made and
repaired by the statute Labour commuted.  The people, in
general, suppose that turnpike roads would be of advantage.
Some farmers in this parish pursue improvements with spirit;
but the climate struggles against them.  Plantations of wood
in this part of the country would be of great advantage.  The
inhabitants, in general, are very humane, industrious, decent, 
and devour.  None have enlisted in the army since 1778.
