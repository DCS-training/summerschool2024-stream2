   Poor.-Though the parish of Cupar is very populous, yet,
during the last 20 years, there have never been, at any time,
more than from 4 to 7 beggars belonging to it.  The num-
ber of begging poor is at present 5.  The number of poor
house-holders, however, is very considerable.  Fifteen receive
from the kirk-session a weekly allowance, proportioned to
their various claims.  A far greater number are supplied oc-
casionally.  Parochial assessments, for the maintainance of
the poor, in this part of the kingdom, are yet unknown;

property-In a building which stands near to the church
????  the name of the Alms-Houses, and under the ma-
nagement of the kirk-session, a few aged and infirm women
are lodged, and, in part, supported, out of the above fund.-

receive from the ordinary parochial fund, they are indebted
to the liberal spirit of public bodies, and to the compassion
of individuals, for essential and seasonable support The
town of Cupar, greatly to their credit, give liberally out of
the revenue of the burgh, to the indigent and distressed-
The incorporations, too, as far as their scanty funds will per-
mit, contribute to the relief of their decayed members.  A
society has been formed, among tradesmen and mechanics,
which has the happiest effects.  By contributing, when in
health, a very small sum weekly, they provide for their
support in sickness and old age.  The ladies of several
of the principal heritors of the parish, who constantly
reside in it, have each of them their list of weekly pen-
