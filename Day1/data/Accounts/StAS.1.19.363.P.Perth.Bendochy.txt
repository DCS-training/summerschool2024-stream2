implore a blessing on the gospel, and stretching out the
other, to the enemy, to help to pull it down.  They stumble
on that block, which bears the inscription, that the Pope is
Antichrist.  But who is Antichrist now?  He or his ene-
mies?  The Revelation of St John decides it:" He is An-
"tichrist that denieth the Father and the Son."  Why,
my friends you care as little for the gospel and the Sab-
bath-day, as you do for the Pope, or the Establishment;
otherwise you would not expose the shame of your naked-
ness, by joining with Sans Cullotes, to dance with them upon
the decade.  One word more on this subject, and I have
done.  Babylon was a great city, and no better than it
should be.  Rome was a great city, and the whore of Baby-
lon.  Beware of making cities too great.  They are ca-
pable of making sudden tumults.  It was not France, but
Paris, that twice overturned the Government, and left eve-
ry man to do that which was right in his own eyes.  To
prevent the exorbitant growth of cities may be done by in-
dividuals, but is not to be attempted by statesmen.  If the
property of the nation were spent by its possessors in pro-
vincial towns, (rather than all collectted at the metropolis),
property would be less liable to the effect of sudden con-
vulsions The most despotic and cruel of all governors
were the mobs of Athens and Rome.  From such Inhu-
man matters, Good Lord deliver us!

   Canal.-A canal would be very beneficial to this coun-
try.  It could be brought from Perth, along the east bank
of the Tay, as far as the head of the Stormont-field canal;
and could from thence be carried on higher grounds to Cupar
Angus, from whence is level ground all along the Loch
of Forfar, which is not quite 200 feet above the level of
the sea.
