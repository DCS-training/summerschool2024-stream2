lined with them.  Rhomboidal spar, both opake and trans-
parent, is also met with.  The schistus, No. 5. is extremely
hard; but, when lying in a dry place, as in the waste of the
coal-pit, it gradually decomposes, and acquires a flacky ap-
pearance.  It is a beautiful vitriolic eflorescence, perfectly
resembling plume alum, but seems to have more of the vitri-
olated iron than vitriolated clay.  In this stratum of schistus,
and in the stratum of coal, pyrites abound so much, that na-
tive copperas is sometimes found.  They lie not in any regular
bed, but interspersed through the stratum, and are separated
from the coal by the workmen.  They are employed in a
copperas or green vitriol manufacture, established at Hurlet
in 1753 by a company from Liverpool.-A bituminous sub-
stance is found both in the lime and whin-stone quarries.  It
drops in a fluid state from the limestone at Blackhall.  In
that at Hutler it is found solid; sometimes so indurated as to
be brittle; sometimes so soft as to cut with a knife; in either
state highly inflammable.

   Figured Stones.-At Harelaw, a farm belonging to the Earl
of Glasgow, are found stones in considerable quantities, with
well defined vegetable impressions.  The impressions are up-
on a concave surface, and evidently formed by its application
to the convexity of a stem or branch of a tree.  In some spe-
cimens, they present the appearance of a kind of rhomboidal
net-work; in others, that of regular indentations, nearly re-
sembling what we may conceive would be retained by a soft
body from its application to the cone of the fir-tree.  A body
of a compressed cylindrical form, which has communicated
these impressions, is sometimes found: It is figured upon the
surface in a manner corresponding to these indentations:
And, though no plant precisely resembling it is now known
in this country, it is evidently a portion of a petrified branch
