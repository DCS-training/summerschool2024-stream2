   The manse consists of three parts, viz. the original structure,
built in 1763, and two wings or additions; that at the east end,
built in 1798, and the other at the west end in 1815.  Although
it possesses a great deal of accommodation, it is far from being a
convenient or sufficient house.  The garden and grounds were
laid out with great taste, and at considerable expense, by the late
incumbent, the Rev. William Boyd, who was inducted and or-
dained in 1797, and died in 1839.  He has been succeeded by
his youngest son, the Rev. Alexander Boyd, inducted and ordained
1st January 1840.  The heritors of Crimond have long been dis-
tinguished for their liberality in regard to the public buildings.
The church, manse, and school-house are inspected annually by
competent workmen, and every necessary repair emmediately exe-
cuted.  They are also insured against loss by fire at the heritors'
expense.  The whole glebe land is exactly as follows:-Garden
in front of manse, 1 rood 35 falls ; vegetable and small fruit-gar-
den, 1 rood 33 falls ; arable land, 6 acres, 2 roods, 37 falls ; site of
houses, planting, waste, &c. 1 acre.  Total imperial measure, 8
acres, 2 roods, 25 falls ; or, Scots measure, 6 acres, 3 roods, 17 1/2
falls.  Besides the above, the churchyard and site of the old
church contains 1 rood 7 falls; site of new church, 28 falls.  Im-
perial measure, 1 rood 35 falls.  The glebe land is in a state of
high cultivation, and worth annually about L.1, 10s. per acre im-
perial.  The stipend, being 15 chalders, half barley and half meal,
varies from L.200 to L.300 per annum, according to the fiar prices.
L.8, 6s. 8d. Sterling are also allowed for communion elements.
   The establlished Church is the only church or chapel within
the parish.  In the former part of this account, under the head
Population, the total number of inhabitants in 1838 was stated to
be about 830.  Since that time, from causes already hinted at, a
farther reduction has taken place; and, by a pretty accurate cen-
sus, made by the minister in the course of parochial visitation in
January and February 1840, it does not exceed as follows: Pres-
byterians in connection with the Established Church, 575; Epis-
copalians, 158; Roman Catholics, 10; Seceders, 7; total, 750.
There is, properly speaking, only one native Roman Catholic resi-
dent in the parish; the others belonging to that church come from
Ireland, and have only a temporary residence in connection with
the coast-guard service.  The few Seceders being eight miles distant
from their piece of worship, attend the parish church, except at
the observation of the Lord's Supper, when they join their own
