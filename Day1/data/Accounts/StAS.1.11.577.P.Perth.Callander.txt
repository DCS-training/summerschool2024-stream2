     of Callander.

W: from Callander, and accessible by a carriage road.  A tra-
veller going by the S. limb of Ben-ledi, and along the sides of
two beautiful lakes, has these lakes sometimes concealed from
his view; and sometimes they appear in all their extent, hav-
ing their banks clad with a succession of fields, trees, houses,
flocks and herds.  One while his road is formed on a bulwark,
like the key of a harbour, raised on the very borders of the
deep; another while, he travels through darkening woods,
whose solemn gloom is scarcely penetrated by a ray of the
fun.  On the right is the forest of Glenfinlas, which is green to

of the family of Monteath.  Ben-venu, is called the small moun-

which it is almost equally distant, forming nearly a straight
line with both.
   When you enter the Trosachs, there is such an assemblage
of wildness and of rude grandeur, as beggars all description,
and fills the mind with the most sublime conceptions.  It
seems as if a whole mountain had been torn in pieces, and
frittered down by a convulsion of the earth; and the huge
fragments of rocks, and woods, and hills, scattered in confusion,
for two miles, into the E. end, and on the sides of Loch-Ca-
therine.  The access to the lake is through a narrow pass, of
half a mile in length, such as AEneas had in his dreary passage
to visit his father's home, "vastoque immanis hiatu."  The
rocks are of a stupenduous height, and seem ready to close
above the traveller's head, or to fall down and bury him in
their ruins.  A huge column of these rocks was, some years
