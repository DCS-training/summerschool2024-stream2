than on the management of live-stock. Although the low pas-
ture is much encumbered with brushwood, yet it and the hill graz-
ing are sound and healthy; but both would be much improved
by surface drains. The sheep reared are all of the black-
faced kind. The cattle are of the pure West Highland breed,
and, in point of size and symmetry, are considered equal
to the best that are exhibited at the local markets. Many of
the farms are let to three or four tenants, and as the land is cul-
tivated according to what is called the runrig system, it is scarcely
possible to obtain unity of purpose, or exertion to prosecute those
measures by which improvements are effected. There are, how-
ever, many instances, where draining, liming, and most approved
measures of improvement are prosecuted, and a regular rotation
of cropping observed, by which grain and green crops of good
quality are raised. The several possessions are generally sur-
rounded by stone dikes; but, although a few of the farms, which
are under regular management, have their arable ground pro-
perly subdivided with stone fences, yet, in very many cases, these
subdivisions are temporary erections to preserve the crops for a
single season from trespass.
