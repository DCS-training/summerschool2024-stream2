is a tannery lately erected, which carries on a good deal of
business.  This last year, the company bought 400 hides.
Within these 3 years, 2 houses have been erected for spinning
cotton, with common and mule jennies; also a cotton mill,
on a small scale, for carding the cotton.  In these 2 houses
there are 12 mule jennies, and 16 common ones.  The per-
sons employed, are

None of the yarn is manufactured here into cloth.  It is fold
in Glasgow and Paisley.  As long as this is the case, the cot-
ton manufacture can never be carried on to any extent.
Though a large capital be no doubt necessary, for bringing
cotton goods of all kinds into the market, it is not, how-
ever, so much the want of a capital, as of a market, that
prevents the manufacturers in this place, and on the whole
of this west coast, from manufacturing their own cotton yarn.
The readiest, and, every thing considered, perhaps the most
advantageous market for this west country, would be Ireland.
But so very high are the Irish duties on Scotch muslins, and
on every kind of Scotch goods, in which there is so much as
single thread of cotton yarn, as amounts to a total prohibi-
tion of carrying these goods to the Irish market.  This gives
the greatest encouragement to smuggling, and has also made
several very considerable cotton manufacturers leave Glasgow,
and other places in its neighbourhood, and settle in Ireland.
At the same time, it is not a little surprising, that Irish linens
are brought into Scotland duty free.  Does not this discover
an undue partiality in favour of that kingdom?  It is thought,
that no less than 100,000 L. worth of Scotch muslins; and other
Scotch cotton goods, would be annually sold in the Irish market,
