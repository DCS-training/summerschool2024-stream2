gredients mixed with the tar and butter, in order to reduce
the quantity of these expensive articles, he found that butter-
milk in a certain proportion, produced this effect.  Thus, 2
pints of butter milk, added to 6 pints of tar, Scots measure,
and 12 pounds Tron, of butter, will smear 4 sheep more
than the same quantity of tar and butter by themselves.  It
the butter-milk be a week or two old, it is so much the better.
It makes the tar and butter incorporate more closely, renders
the salve firm, and draws much finer upon the sheep, than
without it.  Besides these advantages, the salve thus prepar-
ed, is fit for immediate use; whereas, without this ingredi-
ent, it requires to stand some days after it is made, before it
can be used.
   The horses kept in this parish, are entirely destined for the
purposes of husbandry, and a very few are reared for sale.
   A table is subjoined, shewing the numbers of each kind of
cattle in the parish.

   This article ought not to be concluded, without taking
notice of the laudable exertions of Archibald Edmonstone, an
extensive grazier on the Duntreath estate, to introduce im-
provements in his, line.  Among many other attempts to
this purpose, (to which allusions have oftener than once been
already made in this account,) he has lately introduced a few
sheep of the true Spanish breed into his farm.  The only
hazard of which he was apprehensive, was that the inclemen-
