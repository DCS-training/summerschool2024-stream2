earthen fences is generally given up, except for protecting
young trees.
   Not above one half of the land is laboured.  The rest
consists of mountains, moors, and plantations.  The parish
not only generally supplies itself with provisions, but spares
a considerable overplus to other places.  In the years 1782
and 1783 there was less scarcity than during last winter.
The supply of meal, given by Government anno 1783, for
assisting those parishes which were straitened for provisions,
was found unnecessary here.  Notwithstanding the general
scarcity this year, little grain has been imported into the
parish.
   No hemp is raised here.  But a considerable quantity of
ground is employed in the culture of flax.  Although this
of necessity varies, it is supposed that, at an average, there
may be 40 or 50 acres annually sown with flax-feed.  With-
in the memory of some still living, no grass-seeds of any
kind were sown.  Now, a great deal of land is laid out in
this manner.
   A small quantity of marl was found, some years ago, in
a pit7 on the farm of Deirachie.  But it was all expended
on that farm.  Very little lime is used, because of the
great length of carriage; but a good deal of marl, which is
brought from the Loch of Kinordie, in the parish of Kirry-
muir.  Some of the ground is very productive.  This year,
in a haugh on the estate of John Ogilvy, Esq; of Inshavan,
I counted 21 stalks of oats growing from one root, the most
of these from 5 feet 8 inches, to 6 feet high, and some of
them carrying between 140 and 150 grains each.
   A considerable part of the parish is employed in pasture.
The hills afford excellent pasture for sheep.  Wedders are
sometimes brought down from the Glen of Ogil in the
month of August, which weigh 10 lb. per quarter, and give
10 lb. of tallow.
