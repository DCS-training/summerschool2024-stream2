     Statistical Account

and the following years?  We can adopt no conclusion with
candour or consistency, but that the remarkable circumstances
of that time, are not to be ascribed to those who were the
instruments of producing them, or to any peculiarity in the
means which they employed; but to the real efficacy of the
doctrines of Christ, and to the power of God which accom-
panied them.
   2dly, Let it be allowed, that all were affected in the same
way, and that they expressed themselves in the same, or in simi-
lar words; let it be granted that all sighed, and groaned, and
cried; though Mr Robe in his narrative, last edition, page
128, says, that those who discovered such appearances, were
by far the fewest in number, being not one out of six, of
those who felt this religious concern.  But, may not an ho-
nest mind reasonably conclude, that the same cause should
produce similar effects; and that the similarity in different
persons, indicated the operations of the same spirit in them all.
   3dly, The power of sympathy is undoubtedly great; no
man denies it to be so, who knows any thing of the human
frame.  It is not improbable that its influence was conside-
rable on the people of that time.  But he, "who has the
"hearts of all men in his hands, and who turns them as the ri-
"vers of waters whithersoever he will," "who makes the very
"wrath of men to praise him," might or did employ, even
this as the means of "turning many to righteousness."  But
whatever energy we ascribe to the means, let us not forget
the hand which directs them to their end, or "the power
"which worketh all in all!" without the agency of God, the
influence of the most powerful means is ineffectual.  Nei-
ther is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but
God who giveth the increase.  I have no doubt that there
were both enthusiasts and hypocrites distinguished in 1742.
Mr Robe acknowledges this in his narrative, page 271.  But
