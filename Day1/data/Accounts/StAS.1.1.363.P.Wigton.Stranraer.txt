   No unfavourable conclusion must be drawn from the state
of last year, as if the manufacture were declining.  For one
of the manufacturers, who is well known to have stamped a
considerable quantity of linen, being from home, the amount
of his produce is omitted in the account for 1790.

   The farmers generally export their corn, which produces
very serious consequences to the inhabitants, as they are obli-
ged to purchase meal at the discretionary price of the seller.
To remedy this sore evil, about twenty years ago, a number
of mechanics, countenanced by many of the more respectable
and wealthy inhabitants, formed themselves into an associa-
tion, whole object was to purchase meal, to be distributed
weekly to the subscribers only Each subscriber, at his entry,
originally paid five shillings, (now seven shillings and fix-
pence), and thirteen pence a year.  It is governed by a dea-
con, as he is called, and twelve assessors, chosen annually.
This institution has produced very good effects.  The subscri-
bers, and the poor in general, are regularly supplied at a price
rather below the rate of the country.  Their stock is now a-
bout L. 140 Sterling.
