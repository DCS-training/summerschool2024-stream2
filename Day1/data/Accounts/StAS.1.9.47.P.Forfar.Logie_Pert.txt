cult, as well as expensive, to procure them; so that the pa-
rishioners here, in a short time, will be chiefly confined to
two articles, wood and coals.  Burn-wood at present is
by no means plentiful; and though there be a good many
rising plantations in the parish, yet these mostly consist of
hard wood; and, at any rate, several years must elapse be-
fore they can prove serviceable in the way of fuel.  On this
account, there will be at least a temporary necessity of u-
sing a greater quantity of coal, which will fall very heavy
on the poorer sort, by reason of the additional tax on that
article, all to the north of the Red Head, a promontory
near Arbroath.  It is hoped the Legislature will be in-

Under this article it may be proper to remark, that the
bleachfields lime quarries, &c. in the parish are a very con-

dividuals; besides, the smaller tenants, and others who have
horses, earn no inconsiderable profit, by carting coals to
the time works from Montrose.

   Stipend, School, Poor.-The value of the living, including

The patrons are the Crown, and the New College of St
Andrew's per vices.  The schoolmaster's salary, including
school-fees, and other perquisites, is better than L. 20 Ster-
ling a year, besides a free house and garden.  He has in
the winter season from 40 to 50 scholars, and in summer
from 30 to 40.  His terms for Latin and arithmetic are
2 s. 6 d. the quarter; writing 2 s.; reading English 1 s. 6 d.
The number of poor in the parish at present receiving alms,
is about 25.  The annual amount for their relief, may be,
one year with another, about L. 40 Sterling.

   Prices of Provisions, Labour, &c.-All kinds of butcher
meat sell nearly at 4 d. the lb. except pork, which is about
