   By a list in March 1791, the number of the inha-
bitants is 727.  They have decreased 230 within these fifteen
years.  The season is, that the town of Rothesay finds em-
ployment for day labourers, and other workmen, and affords
them higher wages than they can receive in a country pa-
rish.  The population, according to Dr Webster, was 979
souls.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-There is a ready sale for
every kind of produce, either at Rothesay, Greenock, or the
Largs.  There are two packets every week from Rothesay,
and a ferry-boat once every week from Scoulay, near Mount
Stuart, to the Largs.  Few of the inhabitants export their
own commodities; buyers come to the island, and are at the
expence of ferrying them over to the other side.  The disad-
vantages are, 1st, Want of coal.  Trials have been often
made to find coal, and within this five years by Lord Mount
Stuart fending men skilled in that employment from New-
castle; but unfortunately all their trials were ineffectual.  The
parish abounds with limestone, and, is a good seam of coal
could be found, the island would be the wealthiest in the
kingdom.  Possibly that may yet be effected, if farther trials
were made.  2dly, The farmers being employed the most
part of the summer in casting and leading peats, cannot pro-
vide manure for their farms, the summer season being the
fittest for that purpose; but what for some years past appears
to be the greatest disadvantage to the farming interest of the
parish is the bounty to the buss-fishing, which is carried on
to a great extent in Rothesay.  Few farmer's sons are bred
to farming.  To purchase a small share in a herring buss,
and become master of it, seems to be their great ambition.  It
is a fact, that all the young men of the parish engage in the
herring fishery; and, when once engaged, though they have
