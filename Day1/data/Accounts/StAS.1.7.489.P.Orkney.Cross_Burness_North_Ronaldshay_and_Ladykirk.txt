   Antiquities.-There is a large stone, about 9 or 10 feet
high, and 4 broad, placed upright in a plain, in the isle of
North Ronaldshay; but no tradition is preserved concerning
it, whether erected in memory of any signal event, or for the
purpose of administering justice, or for religious worship.  The
writer of this has seen 50 of the inhabitants assembled there
on the first day of the year, and dancing with moon light, with
no other music than their own singing.-There are some bar-
rows or tumuli; but none has been opened but one, in which
was found a building 9 feet in diameter, round in the outside,
and square and hollow within.  In the bottom was a well.
In the upper part of the building was found the skeleton of
a human body placed obliquely, or nearly upright.  There
were large stones in it, placed upright, of 6 or 7 feet long.
There was found in the vault or pended roof of a quire, at
Cross parish church, when repaired above 30 years ago, a
coffin, containing the skeleton of a man that seemed to have
been of superior rank, as there was a velvet cap on the head,
and several pieces of silk and ribbon ornaments.-No remark-
able battles have been fought here.  Tradition reports, that
the inhabitants of Stronsay, the next adjacent island, some-
times, or once at least, attacked them, and chose for this
purpose the time of divine service, thereby to surprise them;
and that the invaders were defeated and slain to one man.
