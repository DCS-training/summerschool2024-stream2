tion and uproar; but, except 2 or 3 individuals, who have
unfortunately abused themselves with the spirit of whisky,
they may be regarded as a temperate and sober people.
They are not, as formerly, the dupes of superstitious cre-
dulity.  Many old useless rites and ceremonies are laid a-
side.  Little attention is paid to bug-bear tales: Superstitions,
charms, and incantations, have lost their power.  Cats,
hares, magpies, and old women, cease to assume any other
appearance than what nature has given them; and ghosts,
gobblins, witches, and fairies have relinquished the land.

   Church, Manse, Stipend.-It would be a credit to this
country, if all the old crazy kirks and manses in it were
razed to the foundation, and new ones built in a workman-
like manner, on a decent and convenient plan, and of the
most substantial and permanent materials.  This would oc-
casion some expense to the present proprietors of the coun-
try, who in general are opulent and liberal; but what it
would take out of their pockets, it would put into those of
their posterity and successors to the 13th and 14th genera-
tion.  The kirk of Clunie, though one of the best in the
neighbourhood, has neither comeliness nor proportion.  It
appears to have been built about the time of the Reforma-
tion, has been since repeatedly patched, and was last repaired
in 1788.  The manse, like the church, is a bungled piece of
architecture.  It was built in 1732, and was also repaired
in 1788.  The stipend, including 50 merks for communion-
elements, consists of 3 chalders of victual, and L. 38, 17 s.
Sterling.  The glebe, comprehending the area of the
manse, garden, and offices, contains about 6 acres of
ground, which the present incumbent has inclosed with
ditch and hedge.  The Duke of Atholl and the Earl of
Airly are vice-patrons.
