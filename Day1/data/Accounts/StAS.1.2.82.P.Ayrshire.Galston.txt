     Statistical Account

number of stated poor is from 10 to 12, of occasional from
11 to 16.
   There is an universal society for the relief of the poor, at
Newmills, with a fund which is of great use to tradesmen in
distress.  Some of the natives of Galston belong to it.  One,
on a very simple principal, is established in this parish.  It
consists of about 50 members, and is called the penny or half-
penny society.  It has no funds, which are too apt to be embez-
zled; but, when a brother is confined to bed by sickness, every
member pays him a penny weekly, and if able to go about,
though not to work, a half-penny.  This institution is found
to answer; and might we adopted in other places with advan-
tage.

by Riccarton, and from Glasgow to Dumfries, by Mauchlin,
pass through the village of Galston.  The roads are chiefly
made and kept in repaie by the statute-labour.-There is
an excellent parish school, and a school-house lately built,
which accommodates 100 scholars.  A sunday-school, erect-
ed by Mrs. Scot in 1787, and maintained at her sole expence,
is attended with very good effects.
   There are about 5 to 6 ale-houses in the village.-Kil-
marnoch is the nearest post town.-There are 7 corn mills,
3 lint mills, and 1 paper mill.  Of the former, one is known
under the name of Patie's mill, and claims the honour of hav-
ing given birth to that delightful song, "The lass of Patie's
" mill."  The banks of the Irvine, on which it is situated, ab-
stracted from the charms of the fair, might well have inspired a
