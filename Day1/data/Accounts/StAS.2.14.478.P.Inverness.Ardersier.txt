   Mr A. S. Allan, Kincardine, to whom we are indebted for the
preceding notice, mentions that in the Advocates' Library, there is
an MS.roll of the names of the ministers in the Kirk in Scotland,
who refused to submit to Prelacy, and continued stedfast in own-

to Ardersier as above. He was the last Episcopal incumbent of
the parish, and his continuance as such was connived at both in
Calder and Ardersier.
   Mr Hugh Campbell, ordained in 1707, translated to Kiltearn
in 1708. In the records of the Presbytery of Chanonry is a mi-
