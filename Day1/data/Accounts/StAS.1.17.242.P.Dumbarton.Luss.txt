other, but now never covered with less than 4 or 5 feet depth
of water.  Near the middle of the Bay of Camstraddan,
when the water is low, there is a heap of stones to be seen,
where the Colquhoun's of Camstraddan are said to have once
had their family residence.  Cambden, in his Atlas Britan-
nica, describes an island as existing there in his day, in which
there was a house and an orchard*.  About 5 miles farther
south, at a distance from the shore, there is another heap of
stones, said to be the ruins of a church.  A field opposite to
it is still called Ach-na-heaglais, or the church-field.  This
rise of the surface of the lake, is probably owing to the sand
and mud subsiding near the mouth of the Leven, and dam-
ming up the water.

mond, small and great.  Most of them are finely wooded.
Some of them are inhabited, and prove, at times, commo-

considerable in size; four of these belong to the parish of
Luss: 1st, Inchtavanach, above three quarters of an English
mile long, and about two furlongs and a half broad, contains
135 Scotch acres, of which 127 are under a good oak wood,
which is moderately valued at 1000 l. each cutting, once in
20 years.  The remaining acres are outfield, and carry at
times a good crop.  The island is not at present inhabited.
A monk is said, at a remote period, to have fixed his resi-
dence there, from whom it derives its name of Inch-ta-vanach,
i. e. the island of the monk's house.  A sweeter retirement,
or more adapted for contemplation, he could not perhaps
have chosen.  2 dly, Inchconagan, situated on the east side of
Inchtavanach, and separated from it only by a narrow sound,
