     Statistical Account

   It is rather beyond the limits of these Statistical Inquiries
to enter into the minute of an agricultural survey; but, as
the state of agriculture is the most important object, it may
be proper to arrange the observations thereon under distinct
heads:
   1. Draining.-The first object of the farmer is to fee that
the grounds be made sufficiently dry.  It is in vain to look
for good crops while the ground is wet or spongy.  The
feed generally rots, and, though it happen to take root, the
plant never ripens.  By this means, the farmer finds it lost
labour plough or sow these wet and spongy parts of his
farm.  The parish of Kilmadock abounds with such waste
corners, especially where improvements have not made any
progress.  Almost in every part, even in Monteith and
Rows, you see round fields of corn, with the intermediate
spaces filled with wet, spongy, and sometimes boggy ground.
These waste places are pastured with cattle, attended by a
hind, who, being always negligent, allows the field to be
eat roundthe border, perhaps one, two, and in some places
three yards deep.  This is a very serious concern to the far-
mer.  Indeed his crop generally fails; and, being thus abu-
sed by the cattle, what remains will scarce replace the seed,
and pay the labour.  A single drain would cure the evil.
The places that thus lie wet are generally the richest of the
farm, and capable of raising the best crops; and, were they
properly drained, the whole field would become arable and
fit for inclosing.  It is unnecessary to mention any particu-
lar plan of draining, as this must depend on the situation of
the field.  There is, perhaps, one-fourth of the parish of
Kilmadock requiring drains, that is, presently, almost use-
less; but which, if drained, would be the most valuable of
the whole.
   2. Levelling.-This is likewise an important article.  The
parish of Kilmadock is very irregular in the surface.  A
