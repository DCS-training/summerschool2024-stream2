hance its price.  This is a great desideratum, for which Ork-
ney ought to give a thousand guineas as a premium.

   Ecclesiastical State of these Parishes.-Sir Thomas Dundas of
Kerse, Baronet, is patron.  There is a new manse and offices
building, by the authority, and under the direction of the
Court of Session.  The church of the South parish was re-
built about 5 years ago.  The church of Burray needs
some repair.  The North parish church walls have for seve-
ral years flood without a roof, exposed to all the winds of
heaven.  There never was a parochial school in the charge.
   Lady Charlotte Dundas has, within these last seven years,
with a liberal humanity, exerted herself to promote some use-
ful plan of education.  For this purpose, she has repeatedly
sent quantities of writing paper, and a variety of well chosen
hooks to the minister, to be distributed among the poor and
ignorant.  William Jamison, Esq; a native of South parish
South Ronaldsay, who went about 34 years ago to Hudson's
Bay, where he still resides as a factor for the Company,
wrote last year to Andrew Graham, Esq; his friend and a-
gent in Edinburgh, and also to the minister, to appropriate
20 L. Sterling a year, as a salary to a schoolmaster in the pa-
rish where he was born.  There are no dissenters or sectaries
of any kind in these parishes.  No mischief is dreaded here,
either from the flame of fanaticism, or the fire of sedition.
Instead of sectaries, eager about building new churches, there
is generally a law suit, at the instance of the minister, for re-
pairing or rebuilding the old ones.  The greatest: part of the
minister's stipend is paid in kind, principally in bear and but-
ter.  The yearly average value of it may be called 85 L. Ster-
ling.
