	    		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--SORBIE, the modern name of this parish, was in ancient
times written Sourby,--a term of Saxon origin, and indicating
Sour-habitation, which has been explained as applying to the old
Castle of Sorbie, and to the nature of the cold marshy soil on its
western side. *
	The present parish includes the three old parishes of Sorbie,
Kirkmadrine and Cruggleton, each of which had its own separate
church till middle of the seventeenth century, when they
were united into one, under the name of the parish of Sorbie.
	Extent, Boundaries.--The greatest length of the parish is 6
miles; its mean length aboutl 4 1/2 miles; its greatest breadth is 6
miles, and its mean breadth about 3 1/2 miles. It contains about 16
square miles. It is bounded on the north, by the parish of Kirk-
inner; on the south, by Whithorn; on the west, by Whithorn
and Glasserton; and on the east, by Wigton Bay.
	Topograpical Appearances.--The figure of the parish is ren-
dered very irregular by a conical section of Whithorn, which pe-
netrates its southern side, at one point, reducing its length to three
miles, and its breadth at another point to one mile. Sorbie con-
tains neither mountains nor high hills, but it is beautifully diversi-
fied by tnequal surface, its little hills and valleys, with their woods
and the sea adjoining, forming in many places a richly varied land-
scape. There is nothing peculiar in the form or connexions of
the valleys, with the exception of one which follows a pretty
regular direction from west to east, commencing at Dowalton Lake,
and terminating at Garlieston Bay. None of the hills are much
