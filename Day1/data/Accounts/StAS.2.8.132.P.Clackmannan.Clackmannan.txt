   As to the state of farm-buildings, &c. in the parish, a favour-
able report must be given. Some of the farm-houses are of a
most superior description.
  As to quarries, there is one of considerable extent about half-a
mile south-west from Clackmannan, which belongs to the Earl of
Zetland. The stone which it produces is a light-coloured, hard,
and durable sandstone. There are also one or two quarries in the
neighbourbood of the Black or South Devon. But, both as to
appearance and durability, the stones which they produce are verv
interior. On the Earl of Mansfield's estate of Sauchie, there are
different quarries. They do not, however, exhibit any difference
as to geological phenomena. The stone extracted from them is
a reddish-coloured sandstone. When taken from the quarry, it
is comparatively soft, and is very easily moulded into any form;
but by exposure to the weather, it acquires additional hardness,
and ultimately proves exceedingly durable.

                      V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
  The only town in the parish is that of Clackmannan. It is still
the county town, but the courts of law, &c. are held in Alloa. In
the town of Clackmannan, and in the rows and squares of houses
in its immediate vicinity, there is a population of 1600. In the
course of the year, there are two markets held, but there is not
now much business transacted in them. In Clackmannan, there are
bakers, butchers, and a superabundance of shopkeepers; but the
town of Alloa being only two miles distant, and the shops, &c. there
being very superior, a very conriderable proportion of the commo-
dities required by the inhabitants of Clackmannan are purchased in
Alloa. The principal villages in the parish are those of Newton-
Shaw, Kennet, and, Westfield. There is a post-office in Clackman-
nan, and the post from North Queensferry to Alloa and Stirling pas-
ses through the town about ten o'clock in the morning; and that from
