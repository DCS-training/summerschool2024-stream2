the banks of the Forth, is Castlehill, antiently called Dunne-
marle Castle, that is, in the Gaelic language, the Castle by or
near the sea, from a fort or strong hold of the Macduffs,
Thanes of Fife, said to be their utmost boundary to the west-
ward.  According to tradition, it was here that the cruel
murder of Lady Macduff and her children, by order of Mac-

seat of Robert Dundas, Esquire, a strong old house, said to
have been built by Hamilton Archbishop of St Andrews,

land stands high, rising suddenly from the shore (which is a
dead flat) to a considerable height, thence declining north-
wards by a gradual descent, till near the middle of the parish,
from which again it rises to about the same height, and near-
ly by the same angle as upon the south side, thus running
from E. to W. in two inclined planes, somewhat in the form

or bottom, runs a small stream, called the Bluther, which,
uniting with another, called the Grange, falls into the sea
at Newmill-bridge, forming the eastmost boundary of the
parish and county.  These serve to drive two corn-mills,
from which the parish is supplied with meal.  One of these
being seldom deficient in water, and completely fitted up for
making flour, pot barley, etc. cargoes of wheat are frequent-
ly brought to it from Dunfermline, Borrowstounness, and
other places, to be ground, which renders it not only a valu-
able possession to the proprietor, but a public benefit to the
neighbourhood.  These streams might perhaps be rendered
