imposed after the arrival of the Norwegians, which some ingenious historians
think was about the 2 d or 3 d century of our ‘ra, when they were called in
by the old inhabitants to assist them against foreign enemies. But who were
the authors of all the stupendous military works, whether roads or places of
defence, scattered over the country, we are no longer at a loss to know.  An
ingenious and worthy gentleman, a native of the neighbouring parish of Forgue,
and who has served as an officer in the Royal corps of Artillery, since the year
1758, was desirous to compare what he had seen during his own time, with
what could be still traced in the country of Roman field fortification, and other
topographical marks of their wise military institutions. His situation at Perth,
in the duties of his profession, from the year 1785 to the end of 1787, gave
him opportunities of spending a great deal of his spare time, in these wished-
for researches, which having pursued with unremitting assiduity, he was at last
enabled, contrary to an opinion which then prevailed, to demonstrate that the
Roman armies had passed the Grampians by land, as well as that they had sur-
rounded the cost-land by their shippng; the character, style, and manner of
field fortification, being as evident, and as well supported in the Castellum or
Barra-hill, and in the Castra ‘stiva at Glenmailen, as any where between
them, and the pr‘tentura of Agricola extending from Forth to Clyde.  The
fortified post opposite to Pitcaple, and a paved way of 14 feet wide, pointing
upon it from stone fortress on the summit of Bennachee, bear strong marks
of Roman character, and Roman exertion.  Nor are the smaller posts of rivers
near mill of Eastertown in Fyvie, the work on the farm of Ellis near Udny,
and the elegant circular redoubt near the summit of the Seed-hill of Achabar,
any ways inferior to works of the same kind on the other side of the Grampran
mountains. But if it should still be thought that these observations and rea-
sonings on the progress of the Roman armies are inconclusive, the testimony of
Dio and Herodian, the Itinerary of Ptolemy, and above all, the Britannia Ro-
mana of Richard of Cirencester, lately found in Denmark, must necessarily re-
move all doubts. Nor is it exceeding doubtful that the very Statio ad Ithunam
mentioned in the Itineraries, was near the great camp already described: For,
our neighbouring gentleman, already quoted, has made many inquiries about
antique intrenchments at Fyvie, Methlick, and Ellon, among the clergy and
some other well reformed people, but has met with no remarkable vestiges of
