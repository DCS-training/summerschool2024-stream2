terwards at a rent gradually rising, to such as would engage
to cultivate them according to prescribed regulations.
Were the lease made of considerable length, and transfer-
able by the tenant, after he had improved the ground, on
his taking a new lot, the plan would not fail to be eagerly
embraced; and if it were so, great and manifold benefits
would result; emigration would be prevented; the popu-
lousness of the Highlands would increase; the value of
estates would be raised, (and this not merely in proportion
to the increased value of waste ground made arable, but in
proportion to the increased value which pasture grounds
would receive, from the additional winter food for cattle,
which would be obtained); a greater quantity of subsistence
would thus, too, be produced for the community*.

     HINTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN AGRICULTURE.

   The stipulations mentioned formerly as inserted in the
leases, are all judicious; it would be beneficial to add the
following:  1. That a specified extent of ground should be
well inclosed, and regularly and carefully cultivated as a
kitchen-garden.  In this tenant could make, on a small
scale, experiments, to be afterwards, if successful, applied to
his fields.  The produce of it would greatly improve the
diet of the people.  2.  That no straw should be employed

<FOOTNOTE>

*Under this article, respecting improvements in agriculture, it ought to
be mentioned, that the Duke of Atholl has instituted on his estate plough-
ing matches, where premiums in money, or medals which were stuck for
the purpose, with appropriate emblems and inscriptions, are bestowed on
the successful competitors.  This is the beginning, merely, of an extensive
scheme which his Grace has formed, for encouraging similar competitions
of skill and industry in all the branches of agricultural occupations, both in
the house and the field.
