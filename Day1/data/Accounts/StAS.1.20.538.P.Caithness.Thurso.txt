     Statistical Account

that country a burn (or rivulet), he accidentally hit upon
a small vein of yellow mundick, of about 3 inches in
breadth; and upon digging a little deeper, he met with a
great mass of white mundick, several cart-loads of which
were dug up without the smallest difficulty.
   Upon shewing specimens of these articles to persons
skilled in mineralogy, particularly to some Coraish miners,
they told him, that the mundicks he had found, however
brilliant, were in themselves of no real value; but they in-
formed him, in their technical language, "that mundick, in
"such quantities, was a good sign of more valuable veins:
"That the white mundick, in particular, was a good horse-
"man, and always rode on a good load." And, in short,
pressed him to make further trials and inquiries.
   Mr Raspe, a German mineralogist, having come into the
county of Caithness last autumn, (anno 1789), was employ-
ed by Sir John Sinclair to make trials in the same place;
and not far from the mundick, he discovered a regular vein
of heavy spar, mixed with lead and crystals, three feet in
breadth, and very near the spot where the mundick was
found.  No further progress was made, than merely to as-
certain the size of the vein, and the nature of the metal
which it contained.
   Sir John does not propose to work this mine himself, and
is very well disposed to give every resonable encourage-
ment to any respectable Company that would undertake it.
   The Company would have several advantages in carry-
ing on this mine.  The miners and other workmen, and
any tools that might be necessary, might be transported by
sea to the town of Thurso, within four miles of the vein.
   Any additional workmen that might be required, might
be got at an easy rate, labour not being very dear in the
country.
