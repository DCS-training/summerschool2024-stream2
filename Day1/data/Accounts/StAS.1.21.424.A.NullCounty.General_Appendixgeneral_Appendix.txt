     General Appendix to

Walter Ogilvy of Clova, is patron.  There is a very suf-
ficient school-house built of mason work and slated, but not
yet quite finished within.  Both matter and scholars will be
perfectly well accommodated.  The number of scholars may
be reckoned from 16 to 20 in summer, and from 40 to 60
in winter.  As to the school salary, which is only eight bolls
of corn; it may be mentioned, that there was lately a school
matter, who resided in that capacity about sixty years in the
parish; and that no augmentation to the salary took place,

   Lakes, Antiquities.-About a quarter of a mile west from
the parish, there is a lake, commonly called the Loch of
Lintrathen, surrounded by rising grounds, excepting on the
east.  There are several lakes in this county of Angus; but
this is universally allowed to be incomparably the finest.  It
is nearly circular, about one mile from east to west, and
three in circumference.  It is believed to be fed mostly from
springs, as the few very small rills from the surrounding
heights, would be insufficient for that purpose.  The water
is transparent.  In some places the depth is immense-but
where it could be done, attempts have been made to disco-
ver marle, which, however, have not yet been found success-
ful.  Could this manure be found in the loch, to drain it
might be practicable.  It abounds in pike, perch, trout and
