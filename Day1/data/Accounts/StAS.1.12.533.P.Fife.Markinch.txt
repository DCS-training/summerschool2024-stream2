ly not above two, and sometimes not above one tron stone,
from the peck of seed, the land is scourged, and a great deal
of extraordinary labour and manure necessary to fit it for a
succeeding crop.  Potatoes too are are raised in large quantities.
Besides what every farmer plants for his own use, all the
cottagers upon the farm, and many of the inhabitants of the
adjacent villages, take as much land for potatoes as they can
plant with their ashes, and what dung they can procure; and
for this, they either pay money, or labour in harvest.  The
rent at which land is let, for flax or potatoes, is generally from
3 L. to 4 L. the acre; and when let in smaller quantities, it is
from 15 d. to 18 d. the 100 square yards.

tors breed for their own use, and these are mostly of the large
white faced kind.  The farm steads, with a few exceptions,
are ample and commodious, and every farm of any consider-
able extent, has a cottage town upon it.  This is of great ad-
vantage to the farmer; as it enables him to furnish a house and
garden, or kail-yard, to such of his men servants as are mar-
ried; and the other houses he can let upon such terms, as to
secure the labour of the cottagers in harvest, or at any other
season, when extraordinary assistance may be necessary.

   Mills and Multures.-There are a great many corn mills
in the parish; every heritor of any considerable property, or
who has the command of water, having a mill upon his estates,
