     Statistial Account

   3.  At Fashine, Mr Stirling has about 80 colliers employ-
ed, besides workmen, &c.  The greatest part of the coal is
conveyed to Glasgow by the canal, as stated already.
   4.  Captain Christie also carries on considerable trade in
coal.  He has made a collateral cut from his land to join the
canal.  He has about 50 men engaged.  There coals too
are mostly sent by the canal.
   Total number of colliers, bearers, and others connected
with that business in this parish:

   It has been observed by coal-masters, that no instance is
known in Scotland of a collier being executed for a capital
crime, though they are generally esteemed a rough and ob-
streperous class of men.  It is also to be remarked, in honour
of the cause of liberty, that since the aera of their emancipa-
tion, the colliers are become a more respectable body than
before.  Instead of being considered as inferior beings, which
was formerly the case, they now behave and dress like their
fellow citizens.
   On a review of the various manufactures of this parish,
how much, may we say, does the country stand indebted to
the gentlemen connected with it.  Let other nations adore
their warriors and butchers of mankind, we will pay a just
tribute of praise to those nobler minds, who cultivate the
happy arts of industry and wealth.
