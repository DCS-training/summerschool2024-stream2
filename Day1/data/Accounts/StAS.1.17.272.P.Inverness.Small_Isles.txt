     NUMBER XVIII.

     PARISH OF SMALL ISLES.

     (COUNTIES OF INVERNESS AND ARGYLE-PRESBYTERY
     OF SKY.-SYNOD OF GLENELG).

     By the Rev. Mr DONALD M'LEAN, Minister.

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   THIS parish consists of four islands, Eigg, Rum, Canna,
and isle Muck.  It was a part of the parish of Sleat,
until the year 1726.  At its erection into a separate charge,
it was called the parish of Eigg, (it being the most valuable
island, and that in which the minister resides), or Short Isles.
In process of time, the name was, by an easy transition,
changed from Short to Small Isles.  Eigg is situated in the
county of Inverness, the other three islands are in the coun-
ty of Argyle.  The parish is in the presbytery of Sky and
Synod of Glenelg.  Eigg is between 4 and 5 miles in length,
and from 2 to 3 in breadth.  Through the middle of it
there is a hallow, called, in Gaelic, Eagg, hence the island
derives its name.  It is computed to be about 8 miles west
from the point of Arrisaig, the nearest part of the main land.
Rum is situated about 5 computed miles W.N.W. from
Eigg.  It seems to derive its name from the Gaelic word
Rhum, signifying extent, as it is the most extensive of these
islands, being 8 miles long, 8 miles broad, and containing
above 22,000 square acres.  Canna is 4 computed miles west
