west end of the hill of Fordice, and from that south nearly
to the Knockhill.  The hill of Durn seems to be one mass
of marble, and a kind of quartz, a whie filiceous stone em-
ployed in the manufacture of stoneware.  There are like-
wise in the lower end of the parish, through the estates of
findlater, Birkenbog, Glassaugh, and Durn, inexhaustible
quarries of limestone; large quantities of lime and lime-
stone are transported.  There is a weighty clumsy fort of
slate in the rocks fo Findlater.  Hopes have been entertain-
ed of finding a coal mine near Glassaugh or Sandend.  A-
longst with the limestone here are mixtures and layers of a
black substance, like slate of coal.  Boring was tried at
Glassaugh, both by the late General Abercrombie, and his
father, but no discovery of coal was made.  The rocks on
the sea tht east side of the parish, near Craig of Boyn,
have been said to consists entirely of iron stone.  The soil in
general is deep and fertile, but rather wet that dry, which
renders the harvest late in a rainy harvest.  No part of the
parish is subject to inundations, except the haughs and flat
grounds, near the rivulets, where mischief is sometimes
done, both to corns and houses.  In summer 1772, some
houses and a bridge were swept away, both a Fordice and
Glassaugh.  The same happened in November 1781.

   Climate and Distempers.-The air is rather dry than moist,
and in general healthy.  The ravages of the small-pox are
very much abated by the practice of inoculation.  The most
prevalent distemper is fever, and that for the most part not
universal, but confined to particular district.  It is some-
times thought to arise from infection and communication
with other parts of the coutry; at other times from local
situations, and circumstances of the people's houses and ha-
bits of living in particular district.
