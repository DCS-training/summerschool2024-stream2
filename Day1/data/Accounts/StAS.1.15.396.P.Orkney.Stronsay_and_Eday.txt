kelp ashes, merely by the labour usually adhibited posterior
to this mystical application, became equally solid and good
in quality, without, as with the aid of the magical words and
powder.
   This commodity sold for several years posterior to the
date before mentioned, to a bottle-maker at Newcastle, for
3 L. Sterling per ton of 20 cwt.; but the manufacturers,
or their employers, desirous to make as much as possible by
this new concern, began to adulterate the kelp ashes, by mix-
ing small stones or sand therewith; which imposition being
soon discovered, the price was reduced to 2 L. 10 s., and the
ton fixed at 21 cwt., which hath ever since been held the

For nineteen years afterwards, the average quantity was a-

had about one tenth of the whole quantity annually made in
Orkney; for each ton of which, the heritors drew about 20 s.
the makers and purchasers the remainder.
   In 1763, and for 15 years following, the average quantity
made annually in Orkney, was 1800 tons.  Of which, the
heritors in this district have about 180.
   The heritors, in general, during this period, became mer-
chants of their own kelp, or sold it on commission.  The an-
