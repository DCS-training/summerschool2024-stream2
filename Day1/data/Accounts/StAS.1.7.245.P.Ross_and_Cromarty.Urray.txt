     Names Situation, and Extent.

   URRAY is composed of the united parishes of Urray
and Kilchrist.  The former seems to derive its name
from its local situation.  The church and burying-ground
lie on a large plain, on the banks of the rapid river Orrin, near
its conflux with the Connon.  The Orrin has, in the course
of ages, evidently shifted its bed, and its passable fords, through
every part of that plain, and would repeat its ravages almost
every season, were it not restrained by the annual exertions
of the surrounding proprietors.  Hence it is probable, the
name is derived from Ur-a, the new ford.  Kilchirist is evi-
dently Cella Christi, a burying-ground consecrated to Christ.-
It is situated chiefly in the county of Ross:  A small part of
it lies in Inverness-shire.  It extends from the Frith of Beauly
on the south, to the north side of the river Connon, about
7 English miles in a straight line, nearly from south to north.
Its breadth on the banks of the Connon, from east to west, is
about 6 English miles, but does not exceed 3 towards the
southern boundary, along the Frith of Beauly.  The inter-
mediate space lines the foot of the great chain of mountains
