social in the way of visiting; and flesh is more frequently
used by all*.
   How agreeable is it to see people advancing and thriv-
ing.  There is one drawback, however,upon them.  Price
of labour, and tradesmen's rates, are rather too much rais-
ed against the country man, and most of all among the
farm servants.

   Price of Labour.-The price of labour is much aug-
mented of late.  A farmer's servant, though but an ordi-
nary one, draws 7 L., and some 8 L., instead of 5 L., a few
years back.  Womens wages were long stationary at 2 L.,
but are now up to 2 L. 10 s.+  Day-labourers receive from
6 d. to 8 d. a-day, and victuals.  Harvest wages are very
high:  women 1 L. Sterling, and men 1 L. 10 s., and above.
In hurried times, some have had the conscience to ask
2 L.++.

   Rates of Provisions.-Butcher meat is raised, in the
space of a few years, from 2 1/2 d. to 31 d. and 4 d. the lb.;
butter from 6 d. to 8 d. the lb.; cheese from 3 s. 4 d. to

<FOOTNOTE>

*The farmer is designed by the name of his farm, as the master is
by his estate.  The goodwife is mistress; and yet the husband modestly
declines the compliment.  When you ask for the goodwife, by the name
of mistress, his return is, I thank you, my wife is well.
+Not, however, in proportion to the men.  The men can more easily
remove to a distance; and with them indeed how, all is a mercantile or
rouping spirit; the highest bidder, though a stranger, is preferred to a
good old master, who would willingly retain his servant.  But there is
now little gratitude, or attachment with these persons, and no room left
for their master's generosity and compassion, in case of sickness or settle-
ment.
++For such, one would almost with a scarcity to follow, that they
might the sooner eat up their notes.  It is any wonder, when the farmer
gets such in his power, that he should take his price for his meal?
