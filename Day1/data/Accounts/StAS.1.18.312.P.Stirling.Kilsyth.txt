on an extensive brewery.  The site of it, and of his stack
yard which was very large, were only lately dug up.

   Road.-It is not above two years since the new line of road
between Glasgow and Edinburgh by Cumbernauld was first
opened.  Before that period, the principal road was by
Kirkintilloch and Kilsyth; and it was very much frequented.
Our little village, by being a general thorough fare, was always
crowded, and had much the air of a busy thriving place.
There is now much less bustle and noise, and more of the ap-
pearance of dullness and desertion; yet trade is as brisk, and
the inhabitants except a few publicans, are as thriving as at
any former period.  Two flys, and perhaps 10 or 12 post
chaises, and double the number of post horses, used to pass
daily.  Now there is not a single fly, seldom a post chaise in
a week, and perhaps not a post horse in a day.  The chief inn
in Kilsyth, though almost never clean or commodious, was
much frequented. The publican used to keep one, two, or
sometimes four post chaises, and from 6 to 12 post horses.
Now there is neither chaise, nor almost a post horse, to be
found.  Of course, the turnpike gate, which was formerly
rented at L. 145, is now so low as L. 51, and yet the profit
to the keeper is but small.
   The post-office, besides affording a salary of L. 15 ster.  ge-
nerally produced between L. 36 and L. 40 yearly.  At pre-
sent, it yields from L. 38 to L. 40, allowing a salary of
L. 12 annually to the postmaster.  So that in trade, there is no
falling off.

   Advantages-It remains for me to mention the peculiar
advantages this parish enjoys.  And happily these are many
and great.  The village in point of situation, will yield to
none.  It stands upon a gently rising ground, a fine dry sandy
