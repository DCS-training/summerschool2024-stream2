and wet, makes a most excellent top-dressing for any crop.

   Game.-There are plenty of hares, partridges, plovers,
and snipes.  The two last are much diminished in number,
since the marshy grounds were drained so completely  The
land-rail is often hear, but seldom seen.  Woodcocks also
take this parish in their rout, and are exceeding fine.  Some
years ago there was a considerable colony of herons in this
parish:  They occupied a circle of fir-trees which surrounded
an old building, near a piece of marshy ground, upon the
estate of Castle-Huntly; but when the grounds were drain-
ed, and the trees cut down, the herons hovered about the
place a year or two, and then emigrated entirely.  There
are a great number of crows, (rooks), particularly about
Castle-Huntly, where they have spoiled the beautiful rops
of many full grown trees.  They are also very destructive
to young plantations, to potatoes, peace, and beans, when
the first begin to shew themselves above ground, and per-
haps to other grain also; but as they devour grubs, and
other pernicious insects, it is not improbable but hey do
more real good than ill to the farmer. There are also car-
rion crows, (bodies, as they are called here), and hawks,
but not very numerous.  There are great numbers of hedge-
hogs found in this parish.

yards; and some winters, a strolling red-deer has now and
then made its appearance, even in the low grounds of this
parish.
   The surface of this parish is various; what lies next the
river is carse* clay; the southern declivities of the hills con-
