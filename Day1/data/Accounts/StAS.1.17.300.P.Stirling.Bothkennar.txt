of whom are non-resident.  The patronage belongs to the
family of Airth, who have always exercised that right in a
manner that does them the highest honour.  The late Mr
Graham, who had a particular pleasure in promoting the
happiness of those around him, (although not a member of
the Established Presbyterian Church), was accustomed to in-
dulge the people with the choice of their own pastors; by
doing so, he obtained just and universal esteem while he liv-
ed, and on this account his memory will long be highly re-
spected.  If other patrons were of the same disposition, the
law of patronage, so long complained of, would cease from
being a grievance; and instead of that frequent discord and
animosity, which are so destructive to the civil and religious
interests of our country, peace and harmony would every
where prevail.

   School and Poor.-There is only one school in this parish,
at which 50 or 60 children are yearly taught English, writ-
ing, arithmetic, Latins Greek, etc.  The schoolmaster has a
house and small garden.  His salary is only 100 merks
Scotch, which, together with voluntary contributions from
some of the heritors, his school wages, and perquisites as
session-clerk, scarcely exceed 20 l. Sterling per annum.  It is
much to be wished, that, in this age of liberality and im-
provement, something were done for the encouragement of
schoolmasters, many of whom, having families to support,
must often be straitened to obtain even the necessaries of life.
-The poor in the parish are not allowed to beg from door
to door.  The number upon the Session roll is at present 7,
who receive a weekly allowance, besides a few who get oc-
casional supply.  They are supported by the weekly collec-
tions, with the interest of 130 l. Sterling, which together
amount at an average, for 10 years past, to 34 l. 10 s. yearly.
