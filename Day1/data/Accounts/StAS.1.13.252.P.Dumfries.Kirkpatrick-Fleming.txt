mode of rotation, which certainly hath not been without
effect.  The following rotation of crops is most generally
pursued.  The summer, previous to breaking up the
ground, or if convenient, an year earlier, 25, or if the 
bottom is cold and clayey, 30 Carlisle bushels of shell-lime
are laid upon each acre.  After this preparation, the 1st
crop is oats, which never fail to be exceedingly lux-
uriant; and a 2 d, equally strong, might be expected; but,
in this case, the ground would be much impoverished, and
require its strengh to be recruited for a barley crop in the
3 d year, with a strong manure of dung, which every good
farmer will study to manage with the greatest economy. 
After a slight preparation with a little dung, barley is sown
the 2 d year; the following crop is oats; and the 4th year
it is in potatoes, turnips, and fallow.  The 5th year is 
barley, with which it is sown down in grass-feeds.  A dif-
ferent mode of rotation, sometimes is to defer liming until
after 2 crops of oats.  The 3 d year it lies in fallow, or
yields a potato crop, and receives the same quantity of
lime as before mentioned.  The 4th crop is wheat, and
the following barley, with which it is sown down with
grass-seeds.  It lies in grass at least three years; and du-
ring the 2 first years, the 1st crop each year is generally
cut.  To cut it a 3 d year, or even twice in 1 year, is
deemed extremely prejudicial to the land.  By the latter,
the farmer is certainly more restricted, on account of his
wheat crop, which requires the liming immediately to
precede it.  In this respect, the former has the advantage,
as he not only reaps the benefit of the lime during the whole
time his land is in crop, but enjoys this further advan-
tage, that he can lime 2 or 3 years previous to the break-
ing up of his ground, which greatly increases the quan-
tity of grass produced, and is by experience found to
be in no degree detrimental to the following crops.
