still in a tolerable state of preservation, and must attract the
observation of any one who has a taste for ancient sculpture.
The thickness of the wall admits of several small closets, and,
in the upper apartments, there are large bow windows, a
little projected from the surface of the wall fronting the S.
Indeed most of the apartments are still in tolerable preserva-
tion; particularly the ceilings, which are ornamented with a
great variety of paintings, in small divisions, containing ma-
ny emblematical figures with verses, expressive of some mo-
ral sentiment, in doggerel rhime.  At a little distance from the
Castle, on the N., there are the remains of some works, which
seem to have been intended for defence; and, on the W., a
large mound, which probably had been collected from the
earth and rubbish dug for the foundation of the building, (and
for other apartments below, which are all vaulted), and after-
wards made into its present form, somewhat resembling a co-
nic figure, or rather a sugar loaf broke off near the top.  On
the avenue which leads to the Castle, there are 2 square
towers, which had desended the gateway, and which the pre-
sent incumbent has seen adorned with the arms of the family,
cut out in stone, in the front of the wall adjoining each tower,
in good repair.  The hewn stone of the windows and corners
has been taken out, and applied to other more ignoble pur-
poses.
