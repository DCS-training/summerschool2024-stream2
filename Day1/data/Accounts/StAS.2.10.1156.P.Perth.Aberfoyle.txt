     tem, now so general over the Highlands, of throwing several small
     farms into one.  The families thus dispossessed of the land on
     which they had found employment, emigrate to the manufabturing
     towns and villages in order to procure a livelihood.

                               IV.--INDUSTRY.
       The upper part of the parish, which occupies by far the great-
    est superficial extent, consists of sheep-farms, and the lower part
    of cultivated grounds.  The occupiers of the sbeep-farms seldom
    raise to much grain as is sufficient for themselves and for their
    shepherds.  The farmers in the lower district are generally able
    to send a small quantity to the market.
      The cultivation of sown grasses is now much more attended to
    than formerly; and good crops of rye-grass and clover are gene-
    rally-raised ; the, lower parts of the parish.  It appears, that, when
    the former report was drawn up, the culture of field turnip was
    almost unknown.  Of late years, however, this crop has been ex-
    tensively introduced into the parish, much to the benefit of the
    farms.
       The average rent of grazing is at the rate of L.3 for a cow, and
    4s. fer a ewe or full-grown sheep per annum; but the business
    done in this way is trifling.
       The rate for farm labour, if you engage a man by the year, is
    from L.12, to L15.  For day-labourers 1s. in winter, and 1s. 6d.
    in summer, besides maintenance.  The rate of carpenter-work is
    2s. ; and of mason 'work, 29. 6d. when the day admits of working
    from six o'clock in the morning till six o'clock in the evening.
