or fishes.  Near to these figured stones, there is, in a chasm
in these craggy cliffs, a figure bearing a resemblance to a
bishop dressed in his Episcopal robes*.
   On the east side of the parish of Sandwick, near the con-
fines of the parish of Stenness, are to be seen the beds, from
whence it is supposed the large standing stones, which com-

taken.  This bed, from whence these stones have been
taken, is about a mile and a half distant from the place
where these stones are erected.  They must have had, in
ancient times, some method of moving large bodies, that
has not probably been handed down to us.

   Antiquities.-There is in the parish of Stromness, con-

a spot of ground of about half an acre, which bears the
name of the Monker-house, (monks house), which has pro-

Popery.  On the west coast of the parish of Sandwick,
close by the sea-shore, is to be seen the ruins or remains of
a large building, which yet bears the name of the Castle of
Snusgar.

   Tumuli.-There are several tumuli, barrows, or bury-
ing-places, in these parishes.  One of there, containing
three stone chests, was opened in the parish of Sandwick,
by Sir Joseph Banks, in presence of Dr Solander, Dr Van
Troil, and Dr Lind, on their return from Iceland in 1772.
In one of these chests or coffins was found a human skele-
ton, lying on its side, with the knees bent; in the hollow
of which was found a bag, which appeared to be made of
rushes, and contained a parcel of bones bruised small, and
