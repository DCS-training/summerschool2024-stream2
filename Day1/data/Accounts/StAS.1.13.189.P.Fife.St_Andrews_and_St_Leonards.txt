     of St Andrew's

tinued in use till the Picts were extirpated by the Scots,
who changed the name into St Andrew's.  At this time
the Metropolitan church*, which under the Picts had been
at Abernethy, was translated to St Andrew's; and the town
was new peopled by a colony of Scots, particularly by
those under the command of Fiffus Duffus, whose great
services to King Kennet were rewarded with all the lands ly-
ing in that shire, formerly called Pichtlandia, and which
tha captain, from his own name, called Fifland.  The
wall surrounding the priory is pretty entire; it is filled
with bastions, some round, and some square.  Part of the
priors and subpriors houses yet remain.  Adjoining to the
priory, are the ruins of the cathedral, which was demolish-
ed by a mob, inflamed by a sermon of John Knox's.  Both
towers at the east end are still standing, having lately got
a small repair.  One only of the western towers now re-
mains, and a part of the west end of the outermost south wall.
All the arches in the eastern towers are semicircular; those
in the western tower, and in that part of the south wall ad-
joining to it, are pointed.  The pits are very visible, out
of which have been dug the foundations of the 4 great pil-
lars that supported the cupola, and the foundations of the
cross ailes can be traced.  The length of the cathedral
from E. to W. as marked by the towers, as nearly as can
be measured, on very rough and unequal ground, is 350
feet; and the breadth of the cross ailes from N. to S. 160

*To the church of St Andrew's was given the Boarchase; a tract of
land to called, extending from Pitmillie, nearly 5 miles E. from St An-
drew's, to the new mill of Dairsie, 6 miles w. from the city, and from 2 to
5 miles in breadth.  A considerable village, and adjacent lands in the E.
end of the parish, have the general name Boarhills.  The arms of the
city are a boar leaning on a tree; likely that this part of the country was
infested with boars.
