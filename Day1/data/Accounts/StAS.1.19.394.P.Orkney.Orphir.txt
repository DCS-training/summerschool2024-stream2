     PARISH OF ORPHIR,

     (COUNTY AND SYNOD OF ORKNEY, PRESBYTERY OF
     CAIRSTON.)

     By the Rev. Mr Liddell, Minister.

     Origin of the Name.

   ORPHIR, or, according to the Icelandic historians, For-
fior, is compounded of the Norwegian words, jord,
land, and fior, fire.  This etymology is the more probable,
as the parish of Orphir serves the neighbouring towns of
Kirkwall and Stromness with a species of peats, distinguish-
ed by the name of yarso, that is, fire-land, or earth fit for
burning.  And to the present day, there is a house and
district called Yarfo, from its neighbourhood to a large moss
of this description.
