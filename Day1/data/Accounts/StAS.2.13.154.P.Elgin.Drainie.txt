  Sir Robert Gordon, first of Gordonston, claims a niche among
the historians of the north.  He is author of the History of
the 'Family and Earldom of Sutherland.  He was second son
of the Earl of Sutherland. He was great-grandfather to Sir
Robert Gordon, who claimed the honour and titles of Suther-
land, in opposition to the female claimant, the present Du-
chess.  Little did he imagine, while composing his ingenious
and elaborate history of their pedigree, that he was undermining
the claim of his own great-grandson.  To counterbalance the
weighty authority of this history, Sir William Gordon, son of the
claimant, wrote the history of Joanne& Ferrarims, whose annals of
Pcotland were more favourable to his father's pretensions, and en-
Jeavoured to raise that obscure monk of the Abbey of Kinloss to
the dignity of an historian superior to Sir Robert Gordon, his own
ancestor, the historian of Sutherland ; but Sir William's history
,of Ferrarius, as a partial pleading, has sunk into obscurity.
Of all the family of GordonStOD, Robert, son of Lodvic, com-
monly known as Sir Robert the warlock, has been longest re-
swembered.  Educated at home in all the liberal sciences then
known, he travelled on the continent, and made himself master of
anany secrets in   natural history unknown to his illiterate countrv-
inen, whom he took pleasure in frightening andastonisbiug.  It was
believed be was educated in Italy in the School of the Black Art.
Many stories are told of his proficiency therein, which space does
not allow us to -recite here.
