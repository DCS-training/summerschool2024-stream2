situation.  Their arable land is about 75 acres; and as it
is divided among them in small and nearly equal parcels,
every man attentively labours his little spot with the spade,
there not being a plough in the whole island.  As the
shores are high, and the water deep, they have little or
no access to sea weed, which in the Orkneys is so much
used as a manure, and therefore they are obliged to have
recourse to dung or compost, by means of which their
lands produce alternately excellent oats and barley.  These
are the only grains they raise; and when they have cul-
tivated their land for two years, and had a crop of each
kind, they lay it down to rest for one year, when they
begin the same course as formerly.  They manufacture
a little kelp in the summer season.
   Their boats, which are 14 in number, lie on the S.
W. shore, under the little town of Gelah, from which
they go with only 2 or 3 men in them, who sit in the
middle of the boat, and, with an oar in each hand, row
over immense billows, in a short time, to a great distance.
In these pitiful skills, in which a landman would searcely
trust his life across a river, they fly to the fishing ground,
almost out of sight of the island, where they catch plenty
of fine code, ling, tusk, skate, holibut, mackerel, cyth, and
other fish of inferior quality.  These, together with their
hens, chickens, sheep, eggs, etc. they afterwards carry to
ships, which they observe in the offing, though at the
distance of 15 or 20 miles, and barter them to great ad-
vantage, for various articles of food and clothing.  They
spin also excellent linen yarn, and discover much dexte-
rity in manufacturing their fine soft wool into stockings,
gloves, nightcaps, and other wearing apparel.  If they do
not dispose of their whole fish, mutton, hens, stockings,
etc. in barter with the ships, which is seldom the case,
