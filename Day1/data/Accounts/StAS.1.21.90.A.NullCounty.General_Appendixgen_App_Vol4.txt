contrast!  This country, in common with others, long la-
boured under the same destructive grievance.  But, the pre-
sent proprietor, Sir James Grant, so soon as he got posses-

perty, and that of Rothiemurchus, scouting the idea of indi-
viduals being picked out, or serving within the limits of cer-
tain counties, are eager to a man to be trained to arms, and
