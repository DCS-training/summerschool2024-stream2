make 1 s. a-day and upwards.  male-servants wages in ge

half year, and some of them more.  Common labourer

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-It is very advantageous
to the heritors and their tenants, that being so near a sea-
port town they have high prices, in ready money, for e-
very thing they raise, and are employed with their horses,
almost as often as they chuse, or can be spared from hus-
bandry.  There are excellent roads through all the parish
made by the military, and no turnpikes, except one on
the way to Glasgow.  School fees are very low, so that almost
every person has an opportunity of following any branch
of learning.  Packets fail every day to Greenock and Port
Glasgow; and a stage-coach sets out three times a-week to
Glasgow.  The chief disadvantage is the high price of
fuel.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people are very fond of
a sea-faring life; many enlist in the army, chiefly in the
artillery, and in the highland regiments.  The advantages
of society are enjoyed; but here, as in many other pla-
ces, a murmuring spirit often appears, and a disposition
to censure public measures.  Many of the people are
expensive, espeially in the article of whisky.  There
are three fairs held in this parish, at which there used to be
exposed great quantities of linen-yarn; numbers of sheep,
cows, horses, and great herds of highland cattle are still sold.
There is plenty of free stone, both of a white and red co-
lour.  The shore is flat and sandy, not a stone to be seen a-
long it, except such as have fallen from the castle-hill. The
common sea-weed is often used for manure, by the farmers
nearest to the coast.
