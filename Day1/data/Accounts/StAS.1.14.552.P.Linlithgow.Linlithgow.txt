     Statistical Account

from 1 to 3 cows.  The number in all amounts to 108.
Many of these have little pasture, and are fed with grains
or boiled meat.-Stable dung is sold at 2 s. the double
horse cart; cow dung at 1 s. 6 d.; and ashes at 1 s.
   From the number of breweries and distilleries, the con-
sumption of barley is very considerable; far exceeding the
quantity raised in the parish.

   Trade and Manufacturers.-Though Linlithgow has not
that appearance, a good deal of business is transacted in
it.-The people in general are sober and industrious, ply-
ing their occupations chiefly within doors, or on the side
of the loch.  The manufacture of leather is the most
extensive and advantageous carried on here.  There are
employed in it 17 tanners, 18 curriers, and 13 tawers;
amounting in all to 48.  The annexed table, which is
warranted as genuine, will give a juster idea of this branch
than any other description.
