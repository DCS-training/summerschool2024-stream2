farms, than it is now. This change tends, of course, to diminish
the population; and, what has contributed to the same effect, fewer
cottages are required upon farms, in consequence of unmarried
being generally preferred to married servants. These causes of
a decrease of population, however, have been in some measure
counterbalanced by the encouragement given to feuing by some
of the proprietors. Three small villages have arisen in this way.
The advantages of feuing either to proprietor or tenant are very
questionable. A higher rent may be obtained, but an unsound po-
pulation is produced, and paupers, which the landholder must
maintain, are increased in number. Man naturally wishes to be in-
dependeDt,-to have a house and a home which he can call his
own. But the expense of building a house to a poor man, and a
high feti-rent, often leave him nothing of independence but the
name. This, however, many are compelled to do, or remove to
towns, as neither proprietors nor tenants give much encourage-
ment to the building and letting Of cottages. This system weak-
ens or dissolves that moral tie which should unite rich and poor,
and widens that breach between them, which is ruinous to the

peace and prosperity of both.

Habits and Character qf the People.-A great proportion of
the inhabitants, both male and female, are employed in agricul-
ture,- and they are in general very sober and industrious, and are
tolerably comfortable in their circumstances. Few of the farm-
servants, indeed, have now the luxury of a cow; but they have
each a Scotch pint of milk daily from their master's dairy, with a
sufficient quantity of oat-meal and potatoes, and in- general they fat-
ten a pig or two annually for family use. It is, indeed, truly won-
derful. how well clothed, neat, and clean, large families are kept,
and at the same time tolerably well educated, with the few pounds
of wages received by farm-servants and other labourers. Much
