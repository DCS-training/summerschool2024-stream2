   In an old manuscript inventary among the Harleian MSS.
in the British Museum, there is mention made of the follow-
ing charter, `To the prior of Crail, of the second teinds of
'the lands between the waters of Neithe and Nith.' It is
mentioned in the roll of charters of King David the Second.
This information the minister lately received from N. Hut-
ton) Esq. who has been long employed in collecting materials
concerning our old monasteries and religious foundations.

     Corrections of the former report.

   P.  439, l. 5.  For `Kingscavin mill,' read `Kingscairn
mill.'
   P 441.  l. 16.  The sentence should have been as follows:
'That it prevents the barley from lodging so much as it is
'apt to do when sown unmixed; a circumstance peculiarly
'prejudicial upon a damp soil, from the great quantity of
'undergrowth it is disposed to draw up; and that, from the
'round figure of the ear, and the drier quality of the straw,
'it assists much in winning and preserving the whole crop
'in late and rainy seasons.'
   P. 450, Note, l. 13. For 'six,' read 'eight.'
   Do. Do. l. 3 d from the bottom.  After '255 marks,'
add, 'and eight chalders of victual'-A very material
error.
