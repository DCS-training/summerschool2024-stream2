and substantial houses, for though they are more commodi-
ous and substantial than in former times, except those of the
more opulent farmers, very few houses in the country are
built entirely of stone.

   Manufactures, etc.-Next to cattle and grain, the articles
for which money is brought into the parish, are linen-yarn,
either made of lint of the growth of the country, or of fo-
reign lint given out to be spun by manufacturers, stockings
made of wool given out by manufacturers, or of wool bought
by the makers and sold to merchants, called market or car-
go hose; cheese and butter.  For some years past great quan-
tities of the last article have been bought up by merchants
in different parts of the country, and sent to Edinburgh, and
other large towns.
   About the year 1760, a carpet manufacture was established
here, which was carried on with success for several years, and
was not entirely given up till about 1780.
   In 1767, Peter Garden, Esq; of Deigaty and one Mr Ba-
ker began a thread and linen manufacture, and also laid out
a field, and erected houses and machinery for bleachling li-
nen.  The partners finding themselves losers, the linen ma-
nufacture was dropped about ten years after.  A manufacture
of thread, which generally employs about 10 hands, is still
carried on; and about 400 or 500 pieces of cloth were whi-
tened at the bleachfield last season.  In the year ending No-
vember 1793, about 666 yards of linen, and 6696 yards of
harn or brown linen were stamped here for sale.  Of the
first kind, it is supposed that more than the quantity here spe-
cified, and of the last, scarcely one third, was then made in
the parish.  At present, one weaver only makes linen for sale on
his own account; the rest, as well as all the other handicrafts-
men, depend upon the casual employment of the country around,
