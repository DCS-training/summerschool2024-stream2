  PARISH OF SOUTH UIST,

(COUNTY OF INVERNESS, SYNOD OF GLENELG, PRES-
    BYTERY OF UIST.)

    By the Rev. Mr GEORGE MUNRO.


       Name, Situation, Extent, &c.

SOUTH UIST, or, as it is called South Wist by some
modern writers, is a Danish name, and the deriva-
tion of it cannot be traced back with any degree of cer-
tainty, by any of the present inhabitants, at this period
of time. Perhaps it might originally be called Uista,
ofr Wista, as I am informed that there are some places,
both in Orkney and Shetland, called Unsta; for the high-
est hill in the parish, is named Heckla, and the largest moun-
tain in Iceland is Heckla, in the Norse language. The pa-
rish is of an oblong figure, separated from the parish of
North Uist, to the eastward and northward, by an arm of
the sea, which ebbs at low water. It is also separated
from the parish of Barra, to the southward and westward,
