ably well; but so violent were the prejudices of the people,
that, it is said, some of them declared, if the inoculated
children had died, they would have considered it as a just
dispensation of Providence.  It is to be hoped, however, that
a few more successful instances, will have a tendency to re-
move so unfortunate an idea.  Above all, if the more dis-
cerning heads of families were attentively to read the Statis-
tical Survey, it might be of considerable service to them, in that
as well as in many other respects.

   Servants, Wages, etc.-There are only 25 male, and 19 fe-
male servants in this parish.  It will no doubt appear strange,
that this number is so small.  Many of the householders have
sons and daughters, who assist at their work; and there are not
reckoned among the number of hired servants.  Many of the
householders are crofters, and they need no servants.  The
wages of a ploughman are about 5 L. Sterling, and the wa-
ges of a female servant about 2 L.  Many servants are engaged
only during the weeks of the harvest, and in that time, a man
servant will sometimes receive 2 L. and a woman 1 L; though,
if the weather be favourable, the harvest will be finished in
the course of 5 weeks.  The day's wages of a labouring man,
are from 8 d. to 1 s. without victuals; a taylor's wages 6 d.
or 7 d. and his victuals.  The wages of a common labourer,
when married, are scarcely sufficient to enable him to bring
up a family.  About 20 years ago, a dozen of eggs sold
for a penny; a hen for 4 d. a pound of butter (28 oz.) at 4 d;
a pound of beef 2 d.  All these articles now give double the
old price.

   Roads.-The roads in this district are in a much better state,
than they have been, in any former period.  But there is still
room for improvement in this respect.  Some of the roads lie
