lication of the former Statistical Account (1792) employed eight
persons. All these manufactures have now ceased to exist. The
celebrated barley-mill is devoted to other purposes; and of the
other structures not one stone now remains upon another. The
only public work at present in operation in the parish is a brick and
tile factory on the estate of Salton, originated and erected by the
present proprietor, Mr Fletcher, in the year 1834. The kiln is
21 feet in length, and 10 in breadth within the walls, and gives
employment to seven workmen, including a manager. Draining
tiles are at present the chief article of manufacture. Since the
erection of the work in 1834, the amount of produce has been as
follows: 500,000 draining tiles, 20,000 house do., and 12,000
common brick.

   Association for the Encouragement of Industry, &c.-About the
commencement of the present century, the late General John
Fletcher originated a society in the parish for promoting the in-
terests of agriculture, by the bestowal of annual premiums for the
best breeds of stock, the best specimens of agricultural produce,
the most ingenious implements of tillage, &c. After being con-
ducted with much success for about twenty years, the funds of the
society, then amounting to L. 700, were, with the consent of the
present proprietor, transferred to the "East Lothian United Agri-
cultural Society," in which the original Salton Society is now en-
tirely merged. Should the former, however, be dissolved, it is pro-
vided that the above-mentioned funds return to the original object
for which they were destined by General Fletcher. There is an
annual meeting of the United Society held in the parish the last
Thursday of May, when a pretty extensive cattle shew generally
takes place.
