                               IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Argriculture.-The whole surface of the parish, exclusive of that
part on which the town of Peterhead is built, extends to 9006 im-
perial acres, as nearly as can be at present ascertained; about
8266 acres are under cultivation; about 72 are planted; about
544 may still be brought into cultivation, including what is under
moss servitude; the remainder of 124 acres can only be partially
cultivated, in consequence of rock rising to the surface.
   Planting.-Planting on the east coast of Scotland, especial-
ly near to Peterhead, had hitherto been attempted only to a li-
mited extent.  The attempts which have been made have suc-
ceeded better than was anticipated.  Near the sea hard-wood,
chiefly ash, elm, birch, beech, mountain-ash, plane, alder, and
willows have been planted.  The first trees which had been
planted in this parish last century were at Ellishill and Inver-
nettie, and, notwithstanding the little extent and want of shel-
ter, they have risen to a considerable size, and are still thriving.
