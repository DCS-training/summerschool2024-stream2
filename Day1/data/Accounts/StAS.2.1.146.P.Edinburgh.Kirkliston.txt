 The manse was built in 1692; it was repaired and enlarged in
1808; and as it is still deficient in accommodation, the heritors
have kindly agreed to make an addition to it, which is to be imme-
diately executed.
 Glebe.-The extent, including the garden and site of the manse
and offices, is acres 27 falls of excellent land; its annual value is
from L. 28 to L. 30.

  There is likewise an allowance of L. 10 per annum for commu-
nion elements, and the incumbent enjoys, by gift from the Crown,
the feu-duties of Hallyards, amounting to L.5,11s.71/2d. The
average of the grain stipend for the five years preceding crop 1836,
amounted to L. 268, 18s. 2 1/1 1/2d.
  There are no chapels of ease connected with the Established
Church in the parish; and there are no Dissenting or Seceding
chapels. Of the families connected with the Secession, some go
to Queens ferry, some to East-Calder, some to Mid-Calder, one
or two individuals, to Edinburgh. The number of families con-
nected with the, Established Church is about 410; the average
amount of regular attendance in the parish church is from 520
to 550 individuals; the average number of communicants is about
400. The people who do attend church are, on the whole, re-
gular in attendance; but it is to be feared that the habit of church-
going is, over the whole of this, district of country, less characte-
ristic of the people than it ought to be.
  Church Collection for Religious and Charitable Objects.-The
amount is as follows:-I833,L.5; 1834, L.7,10s.; 1835, L.15,
15s.; 1836, L.12, 5s.; 1837, L. 38, Qs. 21/2d.
  Education.-Of schools there are -one parochial, two partially
endowed, one unendowed, one supported by individual subscrip-
tion. The last mentioned is a female school, where sewing is
taught, together with the ordinary elements of education. In
the parochial school, reading, English grammar, writing and arith-
metic, geography and Latin are taught. The school is conducted
with great efficiency, and is attended by about 90 pupils. At
the other schools, the same branches, or some of them, are taught.
