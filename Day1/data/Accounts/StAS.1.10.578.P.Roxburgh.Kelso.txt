whole parish.  The land in tillage is divided into four equal
parts, one of which is sown with turnips, or planted with
potatoes; for both the land must be carefully cleaned and
pulverised, as well as manured.  The common practice is to
sow turnips on ridges 30 inches wide, and the season most
proper for this is, from the 10th to the end of June; when
sown earlier, they are apt to shoot in autumn; and, if
later, they seldom grow to a large size.  Potatoes are planted
from the middle to the end of April, in ridges 30 inches
asunder.  The succeeding crop is either barley or spring
wheat, which is thought by many to answer as well as when
sown in autumn; the third hay, and the fourth oats or wheat,
unless the land has been laid down for pasture in which case
a fourth of the old grass land is ploughed up, and sown with
oats; sometimes the third crop is pease instead of hay, bug
this practice is every day less prevalent.  By this mode of
cultivation the crops are good, the land kept clean and rich,
and at an expence comparatively small.  Upon some fields,
of a clay soil, the management is a summer fallows with the
following rotation of crops, first wheats second pease or
beans, third barley, fourth oats; and upon very poor land
of this kind, when too wet for turnips, and too wet as well
as too weak for wheat, after a summer fallow the first crop
is wheat, the second hay, and the third, if not left for pas-
ture oats.  A considerable part of this parish is kept in
grass and pastured with sheep and black cattle; but as most
of the fields are let for a summer pasture only, it is impos-
sible to ascertain the number of sheep and cattle that are fat-
tened in the parish upon grass and turnips during the year.
It is however well knowns that, owing to the high price of
wool, and the constant demand for sheep and cattle, both
