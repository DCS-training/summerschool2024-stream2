   The increase of the population of Roslin village is owing to the
extension of the works of a gunpowder manufactory and of a
bleachfield, both of whicih are in the immediate neighbourhood.
The population of Roslin parish, quoad sacra, is as follows;--
			1835, 326 families--1611 souls.
			1836, 327   ...     1646  ...
			1837, 341   ...     1731  ...
			1838, 346   ...     1733  ...
			1839, 354   ...     1744  ...
   The majority of the population reside in small villages.  Not
one of these is worthy of the name of a town.

   Agriculture.--As both proprietors and land cultivators refused
to communicate the facts which were necessary to be known, in
order to compile the statistics under this head, only a few general
statements can be made.
   By far the largest proportion of the parish is in a state of culti-
vation; a very considerable number of acres are under wood; and
only a small number remain constantly waste.  There is no undi-
vided common.
   Husbandry and improvement are here assuming a high charac-
ter.  Draining is carried on to 4 great extent; and the face of
nature is changing to the better.
   Manufactures.--The largest manufactory of gunpowder in Scot-
land is in this parish.  It belongs to Messrs Hay and Merricks, and
has been established for thirty-six years.  It gives employment to
about 60 men, 30 of whom are coopers.  The wages of the latter,
who work by the piece, vary from 18s. to L.1, 15s, per week.
The arrangements made for conducting the work are admirable
and consequently very few accidents occur.  It is admitted on all
hands that the article produced is excellent in quality.
   There is a manufactory of writing and printing paper in this
   EDINBURGH.                          Z
