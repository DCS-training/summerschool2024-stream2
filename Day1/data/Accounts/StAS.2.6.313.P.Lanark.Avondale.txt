			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	It seems not a little remarkable that no public works or mills
have been erected at Stratbaven or in its neighbourhood. Abun-
dance of water to drive machinery might be obtained at a trifling ex-
pense. An embankment might be erected at Hapton's Craigs for
perhaps less than L. 100, which might supply any number of mills
every day of the year. The excellence of the roads and the ready
communication with Glasgow and the Clyde, as well as the healthi-
ness of the situation, are all most favourable for such undertakings.
I am of opinion that Strathaven is only in its infancy; and that
from its locality, and from the industry and enterprise of its inha-
bitants, it is likely to rise speedily into importance.
	Enclosures and plantations would improve our scenery exceeding-
ly. This is all we require to render the place really beautiful.
Many of the smaller heritors have planted to a considerable extent
of late, and are still laudably persevering in their operations. But,
in general, theirbelts are too narrow, and they do not seem to plant
the best kind of trees for our district. They chiefly put in the larch
and the Scotch fir, which do well for a time, but are not long lived.
Let these be mixed with hard wood, and generations to come will
be benefited by them. The Duke of Hamilton has done much of late,
and is still doing much, in draining his lands, and putting in hedge-
rows along the sides of the great roads to Ayr and Muirkirk, and
in some of the cross fences between his several farms: it would
lay Avondale under unspeakable obligations, if his Grace would
proceed a little farther, and give us broad belts of planting. In a
few years, he or his family would receive an ample return in the
improvement of the scenery, the increase of their rental, and the
gratitude of their tenants.
