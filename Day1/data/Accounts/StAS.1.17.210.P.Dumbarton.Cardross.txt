     Statistical Account

   Agriculture.-Farming has not yet wade that progress,
which, from the advantageous situation of the parish, might
have been expected.  It has, however, for these 10 years
past, been making rapid advances.  In order to promote this,
the proprietors have contributed much.  Besides their own
example, which seldom fails to produce in the end the best
effects, they have inclosed almost the whole grounds, and
laid them out, in many places, in such divisions and subdivi-
sions, as are best suited to their respective farms.  Farmers,
and, indeed, men of every description, overcome with diffi-
culty prejudices which they have early imbibed.  These pre-
judices operate as a second nature, and, for a long time, bid
defiance to the soundest arguments.  It is a practice in this
parish with many, of never beginning to plough till the 10th
day of March.  However inviting the season may be prior to
this period, it matters nothing; they adhere to the custom of
their fathers.  To begin sooner, it is thought, would prove
detrimental to the soil, and injurious to the ensuing crop.
This late plowing occasions a late seed-time, and of course a
late harvest, a circumstance which is, for the most part, ac-
companied with many disadvantages.  This prejudice, how-
ever, is beginning gradually to lose its influence, and in a
short time, it is hoped, it will be effectually removed.

   Produce.-The common produce of the parish is oats and
bear; and, of late, where the soil is of a stronger quality,
considerable crops of wheat, pease, and beans are raised.  Po-
tatoes are every where cultivated.  The farmers, within these
few years, have begun to see the advantage of green crops;
accordingly a number of fields are laid down in clover and
rye-grass, but the culture of turnips is only in its infancy.
