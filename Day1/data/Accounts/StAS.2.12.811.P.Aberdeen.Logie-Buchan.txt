peits, of 24 feet in length ilk leit, and 12 feet in breadth, with
height effeirand, which would be sufficient for him, yearlie;' the
parish being willing likewise to lead said peits, and ' Mr Buchan
to give the coble.' "  That so respectable a body of men should
have allotted, or that the tenantry should have agreed to carry, so
enormous a quantity of fuel, (nearly 300 modern cart loads,) is not
easily accounted for.  The allotment, indeed, was soon necessari-
ly discontinued; but it would be unpardonable in me not to record
the ready consent both of the heritors and people that their minis-
ter should have a warm fireside.

                       III.-POPULATION.
   In the year 1607, by a note in our Presbytery records, the
number of communicants is estimated at 400, which exceeds, by
about fourscore, the average number who have been admitted to
the Lord's table of late years.  The greater population at that
time may be ascribed to the Ferry of Logie being then the great
thoroughfare from the north-east part of Buchan to Aberdeen,-
the principal road being along the sea-sbore of Belhelvie.  There
was then a considerable kirk-town where markets were held, and
one or more alehouses kept.  There had been also more resi-
dent heritors, smaller farms, and a more numerous tenantry.  The
number of parishioners which, in Dr Webster's time, had fallen
to 575, was, in 1797, so low as 509.  But, from the extensive
agricultural improvements which then commenced, and an unli-
mited power of subletting on some estates, it has been gradually
increasing.
