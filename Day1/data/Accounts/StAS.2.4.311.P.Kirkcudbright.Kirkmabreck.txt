		PARISH OF KIRKMABRECK.

	    PRESBYTERY OF WIGTON,* SYNOD OF GALLOWAY.

		THE REV. JOHN MUIR, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--THE parish of Kirkmabreck is formed of the old pa-
rish of this name, and the largest portion of the old parish of
Kirkdale. The name of Kirkmabreck was composed, says Chal-
mers, in his Caledonia, by prefixing the Saxon Cyrc to Mabreck,
the previous name of the place where the kirk was built. Ma-
breck or Magh-breck, is a local name, and signifies, in the Irish
speech, the variegated plain. In fact, the plain whereon the church
stood, abounds with many rocks and stones of granite, which give
it a speckled appearance. For the same reason, a large plain in
the vicinity of Tarah in Ireland, is supposed to take the name of
Maghbreck.
	Symson however, assures us that Kirkmabreck was so called
from some saint whose name was Macbreck, a part of whose statue
in wood was, about thirty years before the time he wrote his His-
tory of Galloway, in an old chapel at the Ferrytown. Of this
statue, however, there is now no trace, and no tradition; and we
search the Maryrologies in vain for such a saint as Macbreck or
Mabrek.
	The late Mr M'Lean of Mark, in the old Statistical Ac-
count of this parish, gives a different etymology from either of
the preceding. Kirkmabreck, says he, or more, properly the
church in the brake, is exceedingly descriptive of the place in
which the church formerly stood. For, as brake signifies furze,
brambles, thorns, heath, ferns, &c., so not only the particular
place in which the church stood, but also many other places in the
parish, are encumbered with those substances.

<FOOTNOTE>Kirkmabreck was at one time in Kirkcudbright Presbytery, but was transferred
to Wigton in the year 1699.
