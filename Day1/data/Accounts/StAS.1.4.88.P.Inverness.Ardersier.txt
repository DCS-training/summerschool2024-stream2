     PARISH OF ARDERSIER.

     (COUNTY OF INVERNESS.)

     By the Rev. Mr PRYSE CAMPBELL.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Soil and Surface.
               
   ARDERSIER is written Ardnaseer in the charters
of the parish.  According to tradition, it obtained
its name from a great number of carpenters being drowned
in the ferry, opposite to the point of Ardersier; this ac-
cident happened, it is said, in the year in which the Ca-
thedral at Elgin, and that at Channonry or Fortrose, were
built.  In the Gaelic language, soar is "a carpenter," and ard
is "high."  The part of the parish adjoining to the sea, and 
by which it is washed, is exceeding high, upwards of 100 
yards, and it is probable enough that the parish might
have received its name from such an accident; but it is
fully as natural to conclude that it obtained its name from
its high situation, and that Ardna soar (Ardnafeer) is a
corruption from ard'n Fhaobbair, which signifies "the
"high edge" or "height of the edge," i. c. of the hill.
The parish is in the presbytery of Nairn, and Synod
of Moray.  Its length is two and a half miles, and
breadth the same.  It is bounded by the parish of Petty,
