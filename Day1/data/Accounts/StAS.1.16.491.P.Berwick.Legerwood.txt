machine.  Here are two corn-mills, which are in part sup-
ported by the restrictions of thirlage upon the lands of the
parish.  Happily, modes of mutual accommodation have
been generally adopted between the farmers, the millers,
and the landholders, which prevent these restrictions from
being felt as intolerably grievous.  The ploughmen in this
parish are eminently dexterous and skilful.  Three smiths
and two joiners perform that work in wood and iron, which
is requisite to repair, from time to time, the implements of
farm-labour, etc.
   Yet, however skilful and industrious the agriculture of
Legerwood, even a stranger might judge, at a first aspect,
that the feeding and fattening of sheep and black cattle are
the primary objects of the industry of the farmers of this
parish.

   Inclosures, Roads, etc.-No inconsiderable portions of
the lands still lie here and there in undrained marshes, or
are bleakly covered with their native barren heath.  Here
is a general want of inclosures; and those which appear
are chiefly turf-dikes; for indeed the climate, and the nib-
bling of the sheep, are unfavourable to the thriving of
hedges; and stones, for stone walls of any kind, are ex-
tremely scarce.  Except in two or three instances, the pa-
rish bye roads are in a very indifferent state.  The uplands
and slopes are bare of wood, as in those wild scenes into
which the improvements and decorations of cultivation
have not yet been admitted.

   Animal Stock.-The horses and other animals maintained
on these farms are numerous.  An hundred and six horses,
old and young, are kept for the saddle or the draught, and
to supply the gradual waste.  The sheep are no fewer than
3769.  The black cattle are at present 559; and here are
59 swine.
