                         V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Inverury is the nearest market-town, and only a quarter of a
mile from the west boundary.  The post-office is in that burgh.
   There are two bridges on the Ury; one of stone, which has
being built upwards of thirty years; the other has stone piers and
a wooden arch, and was built lately.
   Ecckesiastical State.-The parish church is in the most centri-
cal situation, as ascertained by measurement.  It was built in
1771, repaired last in 1823 and holds 600 persons.  The seats
are all free.  The manse was built in 1772; the last addition
was made only two years ago.  The glebe is 25 English
acres, and would rent for L.30, if let to a farmer; but when the
greater part is in grass, as at present, it is of more value.  The
stipend is L.110, 10s. 1 2/12d.; meal, 112 bolls, 8 tones, 9 1/10 lbs.;
bear, 20 quarters, 3 bushels, 1 peck, 1 1/4 quart; barley, 5 quarters,
6 bushels, 2 pecks, and 3 quarts.
   The Society of Friends have a meeting-house at Kinmuck.
Their number in 1831 was 16 persons.
   The number of families who attend the Established Church is
168; and persons of all ages, 650.  There are 13 Dissenters, and
8 Episcopalians.  Due attendance is given in the church, and the
number of communicants is 430.  The yearly amount of church
collections is L.45.
   Education.-At the parochial school, Latin, geography, gram-
mar, arithmetic, writing, and reading are taught.  The lower
branches are taught at the unendowed school, with the addition
of needle-work.  The salary of the schoolmaster is L.30; fees in
1833, L.15; other emoluments, L.25; and his whole income
L.65, besides the legal accomodations.
   All between six and fifteen years of age either can read or are
under tuition; none above the higher age are known to be unable
to read.
   The only library is one for the Sabbath scholars.
   Poor.-Paupers, at an averag, are 17 in number; and the sup-
ply for each, L.4.  Church collections during the year for the
funds, L.35; and for charitable purposes, L.10; legacies, dona-
tions, &c., L.40.
   There is only one market, Michael Fair, at Kinkell, for cattle
