	into market, which might ultimately create a prejudice against all
	British cured herrings, and lower the price of the commodity so
	far, that no profit would be obtained for those regularly cured.
	   The Helmsdale cured herrings are equal in quality to any in
	Britain, and have attained a very high character in the market.
	This excellence may be attributable, in a great degree, to the very
	superior curing-yards, with which all the curers in Helmsdale have
	supplied themselves.  No fish are cured here in the open air, as is
	frequently done, from the want of accommodation, at other sta-
	tions, greatly to the prejudice of the commodity ; because the rich
	and admired qualities of the herring are of so volatile a quality,
	that the slightest exposure of the fish to the sun, or even to the
	glare of strong daylight, before or during the process of curing, de-
	teriorates the fish.  The Helmsdale curing-yards are all perfect in
	their accommodation, and are cool and ample in their construction.
	The success attending the Helmsdale fishery has been so steady
	and progressive, that, although it did not commence until so late
	as the year 1814, when the first doubtful trial was made there,
	the number of barrels cured at Helmsdale, and the creeks within
	what is called, under the Fishery Board Control, the Helmsdale
	District, have increased more than nine-fold, up to the year 1840,
	the numbers, as appears from the subjoined table, in the year
	1815, being 5318 barrels, and in the year 1839, being 46,571
	barrels ; and of this last number, no less than 23,815 barrels were
	exported.  This rate of increase considerably exceeds that of the
	success over the kingdom generally, the latter having only had an
	increase of six-fold since the establishment, in 1809, of the Fish-
	ery Board, which has so materially advanced the true interests of
	the trade; the numbers at that time, throughout the whole king-
	dom, being only 90,000 barrels, or not double the number now
	cured in the Helmsdale District alone; while, last year, the whole
	quantity cured in Brhtain were 550,000 barrels.
