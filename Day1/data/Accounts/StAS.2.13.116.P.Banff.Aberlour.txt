                                II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
           This parish can boast of no remarkable antiquities.
           Land-owners.-It belongs to four proprietors, Lord Fife; James
         William Grant, Esq. of Wester Elchies; Alexander Grant, Esq.
         of Aberlour; and the Earl of Seafield.  Lord Fife is the greatest
         land-owner, and the Earl of Seafield the least, the latter possesing
         only the small property of Mudhouse.  Aberlour is the only
         family seat in the parish.
           Parochial Registers.-A. parochial register has been regularly
         kept since the year 1707, down to the present time, with the ex-
         ception of some trifling blanks during the troublesome period of
         1745.  A registration of marriages, births, and deaths was uni-
         formly made at the commencement of this period; but that of
         deaths has been discontinued for the last seventy-six years.
           Modern Buildings.-Near the influx of the burn of Aberlour,
         on the daugh of Allachie, stand the roofless walls of the old church;
         and about 300 yards farther to the east, on the same plain, is situated
	 the new church, a handsome and commodious building,
         erected in 1812.
           About the same period, Charles Grant, Esq. of Wester Elebies,
         commenced tbe building of a village on this plain, embracing all
         the holm land of the district to the extent of half a mile in
         length, and erected it into a borough of barony, under the name of
         Charlestown of Aberlour.  This village now contains 250 inhabitants,
	 and has four markets in the course of the year, held respectively
	 on the first Thursday of April, Thursday before the 21 st of
         May, second Thursday of July, and second Thursday of November.
