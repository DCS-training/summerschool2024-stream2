     Statistical Account

   Manners and Morals of the People.-There is rather a want
of industry in the town of Jedburgh, owing to the destruc-
tive influence of borough politics; but to this rule there are
many exceptions; and the common labourers in the country
are remarkable for the quantity of work which they perform.
In general, it may be observed, that all ranks of people live
more soberly, and are less addicted to drinking, than they
were some years ago; and that persons in a better situation
are charitably disposed, and were particularly liberal in their
contributions for the relief of the poor, after the unfortunate
season of 1782.  Crimes are becoming every day more rare.
Only one instance of suicide has occured for these 17 years
past; and no inhabitant of the parish has been banished for
these many years.  Five have suffered capital punishments;
but not one of them for murder.  It is, indeed, one of the
most striking evidences of the progress of civilazation, and one
of the most pleasing effects of a regular government, that in a
country, formerly the scene of depredating violence, fewer
instances of crimes, or of punishments, have occured during
the last 50 years, than perhaps in any other district of equal
extent in the kingdom.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The principal disadvantage
under which this parish labours, is its great distance from
coal, which is found to be the cheapest sewel, though there
are several large peat mosses in many parts of the neighbour-
hood. The nearest coal to Jedburgh is at Ryechester, distant
about 20 miles, on the English border.  Some Lothian coal
is brought by the carts which carry grain to the Dalkeith
market and is sold at nearly the same price with the English.
The country, in-general, and the neighbourhood of Jedburgh
in particular, is likely to derive great advantage from the im-
provement and extension of roads, which does great honour
