the late American war, bought the estate of Strathmartin.
His lands have been mostly in his own possession, since he
purchased the estate.  The greatest part of them is enclosed
with subtantial stone fences, and in a high state of cultiva-
tion.  He has lately let one of his farms, at L.2, 2 s. the
acre, another at L. 1, 10s. and a third at L. 1, 10s. Cap-
tain Laird had erected a good dwelling-house, where the an-

with an earthen fence:  50 acres of it have been planted
with ash, elm, etc. which will in a little time relieve the

150 acres of this moor are designed for a farm; and ex-

this farm, which were ploughed last season, a good crop of
turnips has been raised.  Thirteen old houses have 
been demolished, on the estate of Strathmartin, since
the year 1785.  Eight substantial houses have been built
on or near their sites, each of which might contain 2 small
families; they are covered with slate of tile.  Several
new houses have been erected for tradesmen, and a good
house for a brewer, with a brewhouse, malt-barn, kiln
and bakehouse.  Mr Walter Ogilvie of Tulledaph-hall,

He has enclosed a great part of his lands, with excellent
stone fences, and built some good houses for his tenants.
His farms are let from L.1 to L.2 the acre.  People
