quantity of salmon, which are now but seldom caught, ex-
cepting after the river has been flooded: it is probable, there-
fore, that the methods employed to prevent the fish from get-
ting up the river, are the causes of their decrease.  Consider-
able quantities of trout are caught in Tweed and Quair wa-
ter.  What is called the sea-trout is more frequently found
in the Quair; both the sea and burn-trout are of an excellent
quality.  They are principally distinguished by the whiteness
and redness of the fish.  The trout are caught from the be-
ginning of April to the end of September; they are chiefly
taken by the net, which destroys angling.  The king's fisher
has been frequently seen on the banks of the Tweed.  Large
flights of wild geese are frequently seen passing from the S. to
the N. in the harvest season.  The plover, fieldfare, woodcock,
dotterel and cuckoo, are frequently seen in their season.  The
largest kind of raven, and the true hunting hawk, annually
hatch their young in Glendean's banks.  The fox is also a
constant inhabitant of them.

   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the num-
ber of souls in 1755 was 651.  From the best information,
there is reason to believe that the parish, about 40 years ago,
was double in population to what it is at present.  There were
then 2 considerable villages in it: the one is entirely gone; and
a few straggling houses are all that remain of the other.  Farms
now possessed by one, were then in the hands of 2, 4, and e-
ven 6 farmers, adn the number of cottagers, besides the inha-
bitants of these villages, greater.  The number of persons
from 20 years old, and upward, might then amount to 400,
when, at present, there are not above 239; of these 129 are
females, and 110 males.  The whole souls in the parish at
present are 446:  Under 10,-118; Under 20,-88; 48 of 
whom are males, and 40 females; under 50,-181; under 70
