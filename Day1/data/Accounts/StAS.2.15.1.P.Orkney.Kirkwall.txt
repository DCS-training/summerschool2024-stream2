I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY

Name, Boundaries, Sc.-The royal burgh of Kirkwall is situat-
ed in latitude 58 59' N., and longitude 3' 23' W., and is sur-
rounded by a landward district called St Ola, which forms nearly
a square, intersected by several bays, the side of the square- mea-
suring about 5 miles. Buchanan considers the name of the town
as a corruption of Cracoviaca or Kirkvaa, the ancientdanish name;
but it is -more probably derived from the extensive walls of'the
principal and most ancient building, the kirk or cathedral of St
Magnus, to be afterwards noticed. The name of the parish is bor-
rowed from Olaus or Olave, the first Christian kingof Norway, to
which country the Orkney Islands anciently belonged. The town,
consists principally of one street, in many parts very narrow, run-
ning the whole length; parallel to which, however, a'now street,
called King Street, has been commenced within the last . twenty
oyearff, and contail ns several neat and commodious houses.
The principal bays in the parish are those of Kirkwalli Inganes;
and scapa; the two former affording safe and  capacious anchorage
for ships of the largest size, and the latter being the common plvxo
of landing for boats and small craft, from Caithness and the islands
south of Kirkwall.
The surface of the Parish is, on the whole, not very elevated;
the only considerable hill being that of Wideford, rising about
500 feet above the level of the sea, and covered with health
the soil. being chiefly moisy. Towards Gait-nip on the ease
side of Scapa bay, are the highest crags, and in them there are
several excavations formed by the action of the sea, one running
in the form of a narrow winding passage, upwards of 100 yards
