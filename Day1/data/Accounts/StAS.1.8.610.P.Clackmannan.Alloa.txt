servants, as being more steady, orderly and tractable.  The
farmer provides him a house as near to his own as possible.
It is much to be wished that this custom was more universal,
as it is a most beneficial one to the country.  It is, in fact,
having cottagers on the very best establishment; for the an-
cient kind of cottars were but too often miserably oppressed
by the tenants, on whose farms they were established; as
they often exacted their services more rigorously, than the
landlords did from the tenants.  But as the ploughmen, in
this district, receive their stated fee (or wages), kitchen mo-
hey and meal, and pay only 10 s. or 12 s. for their cottages,
(though indeed they generally have them gratis), besides
their masters' horses drawing home their coals for them, no
oppression can well take place.  They have also the advantage
of having their wives, and such of their children as can work
in the fields, always at hand, who receive the common wages
during hay-making and harvest; and are likewise often em-
ployed in picking stones off the land, and pulling or cutting
down weeds.  All this is of considerable benefit, both to ma-
sters and servants, and tends to rear up an useful, healthy ge-
neration of labourers.

   Sale of Grain.-There is not the smallest resemblance of a
public market for grain, within the parish or county; but the
farmers find no difficulty in disposing of their crops by private
bargain.  The most substantial sell their grain, by the highest
price of the Mid Lothian, or the Haddington fiars; that is,
they give two or three months credit to the purchaser, at the
price Which is the average of the year.  Smaller tenants sell
their grain, for the current price at the time of their deliver-
ing it.
