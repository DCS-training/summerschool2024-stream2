about 3 feet below the level of the street, they came to 2 flat
arches, which they broke through.  Under each of these
arches, was an apartment of 26 feet in length, and 14 in
breadth.  The thickness of the walls, which were of large
stones, strongly cemented, was 3 feet and a half.  Rubbish
had filled up the apartments to nearly about 3 feet below the
roof.  There had been in one of them, a door to the north;
and in the other, a door to the south.  I have not heard ex-
actly what the depth of the walls was, only in general, that
it was not very great.
   About two miles up the river, in the parish of Redgorton,
which is separated from the parish of Perth, not only by that
part of the water of Almond, which runs straight to the Tay,
but also by a part of the parish of Tibbermuir, which lies
along the south side of the Almond; there seems to have been
an out-post, or Roman station, which was probably connect-
ed with the winter camp, or the colonial town of Perth.
   On a high ground on the north of the Almond, and which
the water has been continuing to undermine for many years,
Roman urns and pieces of armour have been discovered,
which may be considered as indications of a battle having been
fought in its neighbourhood, probably not far from the bottom
of the Grampian mountains.  It is said also, that about a
quarter of a mile farther north, in a clear day, when the
water is low, the remains of a timber bridge may be seen in
the bottom of the river.
   This place, however, which was evidently an appendage of
Perth, and where no regular town could have ever been
built, has received, in contradistiction to Perth, since the
days of Hector Boece, the name of Bertha.
   It is not to be supposed that the natives of the country
would affix to the town the Latin name Victoria.  It might
have recalled to their minds, perhaps, some signal victory
