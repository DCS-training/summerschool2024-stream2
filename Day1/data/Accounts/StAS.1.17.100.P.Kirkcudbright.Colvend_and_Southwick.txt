hastily absorbs the natural moisture, and soon exhausts the
strength of manure and improvement.  Of late years, conside-
rable and pretty successful efforts have been made, for clear-
ing the ground of stones and bramble, extending the quan-
tity of arable land, and building fences; so that now almost
all that will admit of culture, or improvement, hath been ac-
tually brought under the plough.

   Sea Coast.-The sea coast here along the frith is remark-
ably bold and rocky, forming high and tremendous precipices,
from which the tide ebbs, leaving dry a large tract of flat
sand, from whence, at low water, may be viewed some pictu-
resque and magnificent scenes: High and pointed spires, at
the bases of which are passages through them in form of rude
arches; spacious and regular amphitheatres, and mouths of
caverns running up under ground into the land, farther than
any human being hath ever adventured to explore.  In the
crevices of the rock, but generally where the precipice is over-
hanging, or most inaccessible, is found the marine plant sam-
phire, well known as a preserve or pickle; to the dangerous
expedients for gathering which, as alluded to of old by Shake-
fpeare* , the people here are, at this day, no strangers.  To-

coast becomes entirely flat.

   Frith, Rivers, etc.-The Solway Frith, here, is 9 leagues
over.  By it there is frequent communication with the towns
of Whitehaven, Partoun, Harrington, Workington, Mary-
port, and Allanby, in the north of England; from whence
lime is imported, and conveyed into the interior parts of
