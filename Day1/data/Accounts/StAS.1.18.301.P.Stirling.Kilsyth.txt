     of Kilsyth.

style in which she is dressed, the vivid colour of the ribbans,
the freshness of her looks, and the fulness of her features,
she arrests the attention, and interests the heart.  And un-
feeling as the grave must that heart be, which doth not heave
a sigh at the sight.
   For my part, it excited in my mind a thousand melancholy
reflections.  But above all, the deepest regrets that such vio-
lence had been offered to her ashes, as to lay them open to view.
   Happily there is not one sold of her shroud discomposed,
nor a single feature or member yet impaired.  But I fear,
that being now exposed to the open air, and the fine aromatic
fluids within the coffin daily evaporating, the body must soon
moulder into dust.  To prevent this, the coffin has been
closed with as great care as possible, and the access to the
tomb is shut.
   The liquid in which the body has been preserved (and the
coffin seems to have been full it, for the whole shroud is sa-
turated with it), seems to be a pure ardent spirit, of the
colour and consistency of brandy, or rather spirit of wine,
But though perfectly pure, it has entirely lost all its pun-
gent qualities, and seems now quite vapid.
   The tomb is an arched vault 16 feet square and quite shut
up; but, from what it contained, the air of it is as sweets
pure, anti odoriferous as a ball room.
   I have only to add, that there is in my possession an old ma-
nuscript, much mutilated, which seems to be a chronicle of
Scotland.  Much of it is yet legible.  It takes up the his-
tory of Scotland at the christian aera; and contains a regu-
lar series of all the remarkable events in every king's reign,
with the name of the kings, down to the year 1565.  I have
compared it with many memoirs, histories, and annals of
Scotland, but as far as I can yet learn, it is an original, and
not a copy.  I think it may be valuable.
