     NUMBER XXXIII.

     PARISH OF QUEENSFERRY.

     (COUNTY OF WEST LOTHIAN.-SYNOD OF LOTHIAN
     AND TWEEDALE.-PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW).

     By Mr JOHN HERNDERSON, Minister.

     Origin of the Name.

   QUEENSFERRY (the passage of the Queen) derives
its name from Margaret, Queen of Malcolm Canmore,
a Princess celebrated for her charitable and beneficent virtues.
She frequented the passage much, and was the great patroness
of the place; hence the name by which it is now distinguish-
ed certainly originated.

   Situation and Extent.-Queensferry is situated in the county
of West Lothian, in the presbytery of Linlithgow, and in the
synod of Lothian and Tweedale.  The parish is of small ex-
tents consisting only of the borough, (the royalty not ex-
tending to the two ends of the town).  It is an erection,
within the parish of Daimeny, which took place in the year.
1636; is surrounded by that parish on the south-west and
east, and bounded by the Frith of Forth on the north.

   Manufactures.-The principal manufacture of this place is
that of soap.  It was here that first in Scotland the making
of brown soap was brought to its present degree of perfection.
