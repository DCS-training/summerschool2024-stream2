   That people continue to enter voluntarily upon such a hard
situation, shows how far the union of the sexes, and the love

Within these last twelve years the wages of a man have risen
from 8 d. to 1 s. without a proportional life upon his ex-

sufficient share in their little stock of books; and it is per-
