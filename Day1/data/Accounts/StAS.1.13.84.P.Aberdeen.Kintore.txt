ver runs so slow, that it has more the appearance of a lake
than a torrent.  In a flood, the river is sometimes more
than a mile broad.  Though these floods enrich the foil,
they often mud the grass and hurt the crop; and if they hap-
pen after the ear is formed, and before it comes out, they
totally destroy it.  The great flood that was on the 17th
of September 1768, carried away the most of the crop, it
being all cut down, and but little of it led off from the
haugh.  The town is also in apparent danger of the river
breaking in upon it, especially when shoals of ice come down,
which cut the deep banks.  Yet the many turnings and
windings of the river, both make a pleasant prospect, and
moisten and enrich that large tract of haugh.  The hill of
Creechy and Thainstown, on the N. W. is the highest
ground in the parish, more than 100 feet above the bed of
the river at the top; from that there runs southward be-
tween Kintore and Kemnay, a ridge of hills, little lower;
and at the south extremity of the parish, almost at right
angles, a ridge turns eastward, and terminates at a place called
Wardhouse.  Near the river, the foil is a rich loam, but 
mixed with sand, and gradually in going from the river
westward, it becomes of worse quality.  More than half of
the parish is covered with a stout dry heath, and in the
places at a small distance from the town, the arable fields
are surrounded by heath, not six inches long.  The marshy
farms, have their soil in many place black, partaking of
the nature of the adjacent peat-moss.

touches this parish; it bounds the parish on the N.W.
N. N. E. and partly on the E.  It produces salmon, which
are caught both by the net and rod, and are sold from 4 d.
the pound in the spring, to 2 d in summer.  It produces
