mile in breadth.  The grazings, north and north-west, ex-
tend 7 or 8 miles, still further beyond the inhabited part of
the country.  It is highly elevated; the air is uncommonly
moist, damp, and cold.  The soil, at the bottom of the coun-
try, is good, intermixed with moss and clay, but dirty.  The
soil, on both sides of the loch, is very indifferent; and, at the
head of the country, is exceedingly bad.  Mildews often ruin
all the crops.  There are many large woods of birch, and a
pretty extensive fir wood, which grows naturally, and serves
all the country round with excellent timber.  This is all that
remains of that immense forest of fir, which once covered the
muirs in this part of the Highlands.  Every where the country
people dig for roots of fir, in the mosses, both for light and
firewood.  In Ranoch, there are 32 villages in the parish,
and 3 belonging to the parish of Logierait.

   Hills, Lakes, Rivers, etc.-As to hills, lakes, rivers, and
muirs, we have them in abundance.  Loch-Ranoch, in the
middle of that country, is 12 miles long; Loch-Errack, a
part of which is in this parish, is in length 24 miles.  They
are both about a mile in breadth.  Besides there, there are
Loch-Lyon, and a number of small lochs, scattered through
the muirs; some of them a mile in length.  All these are stor-
ted with a vast variety of trout, perch etc.  In Ranoch they
catch trouts from 1 lb. to 24 lb. weight.
   The great rivers are the Lyon, the Errack, and the Gauir.
The two latter, when they issue from Loch-Ranoch, are cal-
led the Tumble, a river as large as the Tay, where they join.
In the Lyon, salmon are caught from the beginning of April,
to September, and are sold from 4 d. to 6 d. a pound.
   Thichallin, (which signifies the Maiden's Breast, its form
being quite round,) is one of the highest hills in the island.
According to one mensuration, its height is 3,564 feet; ac-
