quire after the most convenient and cheap roads from their
several homes, to the principal market-place, now at Fal-
kirk, where the roads leading by the shortest course from
every quarter of the Highlands towards England, naturally
unite; and where the whole of the Argyle and near half
of the Inverness-shire cattle can arrive some days journey
earlier than if they came by Criess.  The additional travel
was no loss, while the pasture cost them nothing; but
would now considerably affest their profits.  By the interest
in this market, extortions in the customs, and restraints on
the cattle in passing occurred, which justice and pariotism
would have induced them to prevent, had they been resi-
ding in the country.  But especially the inclosing of certain
lands adjacent to the town, about the year 1750, by remo-
ving some of the drovers from their usual stations, excited
such disgust and murmurs as soon terminated in the ruin of
the market.  Besides the 30,000 cattle above mentioned, it
is calculated, that 20,000 met at Falkirk on what is called
the August Tryst in 1792, and above 10,000 more were sold
at Down in Monteith the first week of November that year;
and at least a third part of both quantities passed through
this town to these markets.  Si tgat tge numbers that go 
south are certainly not diminishing, notwithstanding the
increasing consuption every where.  Some years, indeed,
few in comparison may cross the English border, indeed,
dry season lessen the demand from England, the extensive
pastures and vast consumpt in the south of Scotland, suffer
not the drovers to be disappointed of a sale*.

horses, of which near a thousand appear there annually for sale, as well
as a considerable number of the inferior kinds of country horses.  On the
