     Statistical Account

   In the list of burials, might have been included 5 person
that wre drowned at sea.  There are about 6 persons at an
average to a family.
   The parochial register, previous to the year 1788, was
very inaccurately kept.  Numbers of private baptisms were
not inrolled, nor burials marked.
   The increased populatin, withinthese 20 years past, may
be owing to the farms, orginally small, being frequently
subdivided.  A young man, inclining to marry, and being

fighting against the Spaniards, in the view of a war respect-
ing Nootka Sound.  Such as have at any time revisited
their native country, bring with them a taste for finery,
which they introduce among their young acquaintance, by
no means consistent with their narrow circumstances.  Many
of the young women, in the character of servants,jk go to Lon.

raised as supplies the inhabitants, and they are enabled to af-
ford some assistance to other less pletiful parishes.  Bear,
equally good with any in the north of Scotland, is raised in
Sandness, and Papa.  Oats are sown about the middle of
