   Ancient Families.--Fairlie of that Ilk.--On the south of the
parish lies the ancient barony of Fairlie, which belonged for up-
wards of 400 years to a family of that name.  In 1335, William
de Fairlie is included in the list of twenty Scotchmen who receiv-
ed letters of pardon from Edward III. for all the crimes they had
committed in war with England, (Rot. Scot. Vol. i. p. 381).  The
family continued in possession of the estate until the beginning of
the eighteenth century, when it was sold to David, Earl of Glas-
gow, with whose descendants it still remains.  The castle or square
tower is now in ruins.  It is noticed by Pont in the following man-
ner: " Fairlie Castell is a stronge toure, and very ancient, beau-
tified with orchardes and gardins.  It belongs to Fairlie de eodem,
cheiffe of ther name."
   Boyle of Kelburn.--Richard Boyle, Dominus de Kaulburn, is
mentioned in a transaction with Walter Cumyn, in the reign of
Alexander III.; and Robert de Boyville of Kelburn, and Richard
de Boyville of Ryesholm, were subscribers of the Ragman Roll in
1296.  Both of these properties have remained in the family since
these dates.  Kelburn Castle was originally a square tower; but
an addition was made to it by David, Earl of Glasgow.  It is thus
noticed by Pont: " Kelburne Castell, a goodly building, veill
planted, having werey beutifull orchards and gardens, and in one
of them a spatious rome adorned with a cbristalin fontane, cutte
all out of the living rocke.  It belongs heritably to John Boll,
Laird thereof."
   Brisbane of that Ilk.--This family is acknowledged the chief of
