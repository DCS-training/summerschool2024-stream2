Scots were lodged in the hands of Edingight, by the said
Alexander Christie, to be laid out by the direction of the
kirk-session, for repairing and upholding said bridge; which
appears from the records to have been all expended before
the year 1740.  As the bridge was too narrow to allow
carts to pass, being intended originally for foot-passengers
only, and as it was then the only bridge upon Isla below
Keith; Sir William Forbes, the patron of the parish, gave
a year and half's vacant stipend for repairing and enlarging
it, which was done in the year 1783, in a very superficial
manner, so that the new part of it threatens soon to go to
ruin: And indeed the bridge is not even so publicly useful
as could be wished, as it is not on any of the public roads.
The old bridge, which was fit for answering every neces-
sary purpose in the place where it was, could have been
repaired at a very small expense, so as to have stood for
many years, by a parish contribution: it is to be regretted,
therefore, that the vacant stipend was not made part of a
fund for the purpose of building a new bridge over Isla, in
that part of the parish where the roads from Banff, Cullen,
Portsoy, Keith, etc. all meet, and cross Isla at the same
place.  The roads are in wretched repair, the statute-labour
being employed upon them principally in autumn, when
the day is short, and the earth soaked with the autumnal
rains.  The difficult passes are rendered still worse, by ha-
ving the loose wet clay thrown into them; for proper ma-
terials are never sought for, nor brought from a distance
when they are not at hand, but the mire from the ditches
is thrown into the middle of the road, so that a piece of
new made or mended road is generally impassable.  Add to
this, that the statute-labour (which is a most unequal and
oppressive tax upon the poor, in the way in which it is at
present levied) is performed with the greatest reluctance.
