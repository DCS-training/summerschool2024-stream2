a greater portion of public and private happiness, than is to
be found in the history of the whole preceding thousand
years.
   Scotland, or North Britain, struggles with many natural
disadvantages; the climate is cold, the sky seldom serene,
the weather variable, the soil unfruitful, the mountains
bleak, barren, rocky, often covered with snows, and the ap-
pearance of the country in many places very forbidding to
strangers; yet, by an early attention to the education of
youth, to form good men and good citizens, she has uni-
formly maintained a high character among the nations, has
always been deemed an excellent nurse of the human species,
and has furnished, not soldiers only, but divines, generals,
statesmen, and philosophers, to almost every nation of Eu-
rope.
   Our ancestors, towards the end of the last century, turn-
ing their attention to this subject, beheld with pleasure the
progress already made in useful knowledge and arts.  They
saw that the laws of nature and religion required of parents
the virtuous education of their offspring; but they saw also
that the increasing cares and avocations of civil life, together
with the ignorance of many parents, rendered it necessary to
call to their assistance a body of men appointed by the state
to attend upon this one thing.
   The schoolmasters, thus legally established, were supposed
to be men who had turned their attention to the improve-
ment of their minds, to the dignity, virtue, and happiness of
human nature, to the distinctions between right and wrong
in human conduct; and who were, besides, ' apt to teach,'
patient, diligent, and faithful.
   The encouragement appointed by the state for this respec-
table and useful body of men, though not great, was yet
well suited to the times, the funds, and distinction of rank
