some here, as elsewhere, addicted to censure, calumny, and
detraction; but the number of such, it is hoped, is very in-

height, and inaccessible on all sides, except on the east, where it was defended
by a foss‚, through which the river is said to have formerly run.  It was, for
some centuries, the principal residence of the noble family of Morton; and histo-
