     NUMBER VIII.

     PARISH OF CARLUKE.

     (County and Presbytery of Lanark-Synod of Glasgow anti
     Air.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JAMES SCOTT.

     Name, Situation, Extent, etc.

   THE name of this parish is of uncertain derivation.
Some think that the letter k has been sunk in the first
syllable, for ease of pronunciation; and though it is now
pronounced Kirlook, that it was originally Kirklook; parti-
cularly, as, in the immediate neighbourhood, Kirton, and
Kirstile, is put for Kirkton, and Kirkstile In regard to the
last part of the name, it was formerly written with a double
o, and may have been derived from its local situation, as it
commands a very extensive look, or prospect to the S. and
S. W.  Others, preserving its present form (Carluke), make
it of Gaelic origin; and are of opinion, that it denotes a place
of worship, dedicated to the saint of that names and that it
properly is the Kirk of St. Luke*.  The village of Carluke

<FOOTNOTE>

*From the History of Sir WILLIAM WALLACE, the ancient Scotch war-
rior, it appears, that, about 500 years ago, when the place of worship stood in
the low ground, near the river Clyde, the name of this parish was Kirk-forest.
