50              DUMBARTONSHIRE.

by William Brown, Esq. merchant in Glasgow, there are good
substantial houses. Garscadden-gate was formerly much visited
by idlers from Glasgow and Paisley; but it is now divested of the
fantastic ornaments which constituted a great part of its attraction.
It is, however, still worthy of a visit, being an elegant Gothico-
castellated structure. The church is neat and commodious place
of worsbip, with little attempt at ornament. The material em-
ployed in all of these buildings is freestone, which is abundant in
the neighbourhood.

 			III.-POPULATION.
   In the records of the Presbytery of Dumbarton of the year 1653,
there is a statement of the number of persons on the examination.
rolls of the several parisbes within its bounds. In this parish the,
number was 750; which, supposing the rule to hold good that two-
thirds of the examinable persons are equal to half the population,
gives 1000 as the number of inhabitants at that date

<TABLE>
According to Dr Webster's tables it amounted in the year 1755 to 1390
By the Government census of 1801 it was	       .      .	         2312

Of the latter number 1610 were males, and 1480 females; 1675
resided in the Dumbartonshire part of the parish, and 1415 in
Stirlingshire. The increase has taken place chiefly in the village
of Milngavie (written, as it is pronounced, Miliguy, in the former
Statistical; Account,) and has been caused by the establishment
of a cotton-factory and a calico print-work. It.has not, however,
been confined to this village, but has been general over the pa-
rish; and is to be attributed to the prosperous state of trade and,,
till lately, of agriculture. Of the inhabitants of the parish, 1162 *
reside in Milngavie, and the remaining 1928 in ;the county or
in small hamlets.
   Births, &c.- The yearly average of registered birth for the three
years preceding 1835 is 53; and of proclamations for marriage, 25.6.
Neither of these numbers, however, can be relied on for statistical
purposes.The number of proclamations does not quite corre-
spond with the number of marriages; for sometimes the banns
are published without being followed by marriage; and more fre-
quently marriage takes place without, publication of banns. The

<FOOTNOTE> This applies to the year 1831, since which time the population of Milngavie is
believed to have increased by 150 souls; and that of the parish to about 3250 in all.
