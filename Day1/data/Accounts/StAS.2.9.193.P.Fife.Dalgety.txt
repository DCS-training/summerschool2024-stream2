moting industry, frugality, and prudence amongst our peasantry,
and for cherishing that spirit of honest independence which will
ever associate degradation with a state of pauperism. We cannot
say that any disposition is evinced on the part of the people to re-
frain from applying for parochial relief. A strict attention, how-
ever, is paid to withholding assistance from those who have any pri-
vate sources of charity from which supplies ought to be afforded
them.

                 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

   In a small parish like this, where there are only three proprie-
tors, and where one-half of the parish belongs to a single noble-
man, few changes of any consequence have taken place within the
last forty years. The effects of steam-navigation upon our popula-
tion are very perceptible. In consequence of the increased faci-
lities of communication with the metropolis, their original charac-
ter has given place, in many respects, to the habits and tastes which
more peculiarly distinguish those who are living in the immediate
vicinity of a large town. Nothing would be of greater advantage
to our coal population than a well-regulated savings bank. A want
of prudence and foresight seems to be a very prominent feature
in the character of colliers. However great may be their wages,
they are sure to make their weekly expenditure keep pace with
them. Any system, therefore, which would introduce habits of eco-
nomy amongst them, might render our colliers the most indepen-
dent and comfortable class of the labouring community.
