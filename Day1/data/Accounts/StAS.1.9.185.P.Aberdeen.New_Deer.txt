Banff in a N. E. direction.  There is one thing peculiar
to its situation, the sea is described around it from S. E.
to N. W. almost with a radius of 18 miles: so that it is
nearly equidistant from all the different ports, along a sea-
coast of more than 40 miles.

   Surface, Soll and Produce.-The surface here, as also
through the whole of Buchan, is pretty flat.  There is
scarcely a hill, or even a place that deserves to be called
an eminence, in all the parish.  A piece of rising ground,
indeed, is situated about a mile N. from the church; from
which there is an extensive, and, in summer, a very plea-
sant and variegated prospect.  Towards the N. E. E. and
S. E. the appearance, for 7 or 8 miles, is almost one conti-
nued corn field, interspersed with pieces of sown grass and
turnip, and terminated by a gentle rise of the ground, in
form of an amphitheatre.  Turning westward, the surface
is heath and moor, chequered with some straggling farms.
Here also there is a view of many of the Highland hills
30 or 40 miles W.; and, in a clear day, a small peep of
the sea at Peterhead.  The public road from Aberdeen by
Udny and Tarves, passing through this parish to the N.
nearly divides it, and also forms a line of distinction be-
tween the different qualities of the soil.  That part, which
lies westward, is in general shallow, sandy and dry.  A
good deal of this is entirely barren, and inclines very much
to heath.  But, from the appearance of ridges in many
places upon its surface, even this seems to have once been
mostly under tillage: and it might be easily brought into
cultivation again, by proper encouragement.  On the east
side of the road, the ground being lower, the soil is gene-
rally deeper, for the most part arable, in some places wet,
in others, (particularly about the middle,) very dry, rich
and fertile.  But though this distinction holds true in a
