     of Arbuthnot.

   Minerals.-Within this parish there are several freestone
quarries of excellent quality.  In one spot there is a rock full
of peebles, with some green jasper, of considerable beauty.
No coal nor lime-stone have ever been here discovered; but
some chalybeate springs indicate the presence of iron.

   Fuel.-The common fuel of the farmers is coal brought
from the Frith of Forth and landed at some of the neigh-
bouring creeks upon the coast.  The fuel of the poorer sort
is a coarse sort of turf from the moors, and still a worse peat
sod dug from the morassy grounds.

   Herritors, etc.-The proprietors are four in number, of
whom only one is resident, the Viscount of Arbuthnot.  By
a map of the county, executed in 1774, it appears that there
are in this parish 7785 Scotch acres, or 9893, English, of
which about one third may be supposed arable, the rest being
wet rough pasture and moor.  The most of the land lies
open.  The rent is various, according to the different soils
and progress of improvement, from 1 l. to 7 s. 6 d. per acre,
arable, with the pasture gratis.  The rent of the whole parish
is about 1900 l. Sterling, of which a considerable part is
victual.

   Ploughs.-According to the old manner of estimating the
extent of farms by ploughs of four horses, there are here
reckoned 54 ploughs; of these there are 14 possessions rated
at 2 ploughs each; twenty-two of one plough each; five of
half a plough; and 6 of a quarter each.  At present, most
part of the ground is tilled by the common foot-plough, with
four horses, or six oxen, and some of the improved ground
with two horses.  But oxen are little used for the plough,
