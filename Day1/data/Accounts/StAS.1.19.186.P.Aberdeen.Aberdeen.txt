     Statistical Account

     State of the Poor.

   The number of poor at present in Aberdeens who re-
ceive stated and occasional supplies from public charitable
funds, amounts to 481; besides 25 boys, who are main-
tained in the Poor-house.  The funds appropriated for their
use are at an average about L. 829 Sterling per annum.
Of this sum L. 210 Sterling are allowed for the support of
the Poor-house, in which are a master, mistress, and ser-
vants, to superintend the education, etc. of the boys.  The
sum of L. 151, 5 s. of the remainder is allotted to the ex-
clusive management of the kirk-session, which, after pay-
ing the salaries of their officers, they distribute among poor
families, who have no stated supplies from other funds.

     Hospitals, Infirmary, etc.

   The inhabitants of Aberdeen seem to have been always
distinguished for generous and humane actions.  Several
very ample mortifications and donations for pious and cha-
ritable purposes were made by different persons, belonging
to this place, in the last century.  But as a full and accurate
account of these cannot be given, notice shall only be taken
of some, which have been made since the beginning of
this.
   Robert Gordon, merchant in Aberdeen, by deeds of
mortification, of date 13th December 1729, and the 19th
September 1730, founded an Hospital for the maintenance
and education of indigent boys in Aberdeen, being the sons
and grandsons of burgesses of guild, or the sons and grand-
sons of tradesmen of the said burgh, being freemen or bur-
gesses thereof; and for the purposes of it he assigned his
whole estate, personal and real, to the Provost, Bailies, and
remanent members of the Council of Aberdeen, and the
four ministers of Aberdeen, whom he appointed perpetual
Patrons and Governors of the Hospital.
