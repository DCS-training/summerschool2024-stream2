expelled from the modern plan of education.  A system of
religion and virtue, or any book relating to the Scriptures,
is not taught in the higher or lower seminaries of learning;
a few questions of a Catechism are got by rote, after the al-
phabet, and seldom repeated, as if it were an insult to an
advanced understanding.  This may justly be considered as
the great cause of the immorality of the age.  When a youth
is sent abroad into the world, without a rational persuasion
of the importance of religion; of his obligations to virtue;
destitute of one argument to defend himself against the at-

will fall an easy prey to the allurements of vice.  Hence,
in high life, infidelity and impiety; in lower ranks, mis-
taken views of religion, bigotry and superstition, instead of
the weightier matters of the law.
     What a reproach to this age, with all its boasted im-
provements in arts, in philosophy, and under the last dis-
pensation of Heaven, to be outdone by ancient heathens in
their plan of education.  They taught their youth deeds,
and not words: they enforced justice, generosity, magnani-
mity, all the virtues.  Hence the illustrious characters they
reared in all stations and capacities, hitherto, alas!  unequal-
led in any succeeding age.

   If ever a reformation takes place, it must be by a virtu-

but can never amend the heart*.
   Since writing the above, the last General Assembly
(1794) have enjoined, that a more particular attention
shall be paid in parochial schools to teaching the youth the
