     Statistical Account

Earl of Eglintoune, who, with it, acquired the patronage of
the parish.  At the Auchans, are the remains of a small orch-
ard which was once in high reputation.  The pear, known
in Scotland by the name of Auchans, derived that name
from this place.  The tree came originally from France, was
planted in this orchard, grew to a great height, and was, not
long ago, blown down by a storm.  Some large trees, parti-
cularly planes and ash, may be seen in different parts of the
parish, especially at the Auchans.

   Heritors.-The heritors of the parish are in number 16,
and, excepting two of them who have only 39 acres, reside
either within the bounds of the parish, or in its vicinity.
The houses of Fullerton, Fairlie, Hillhouse, and Newfield
are modern buildings, very commodious and elegant in their
respective forms.  To Mr Fairlie of Fairlie, the country is
indebted for a considerable share of its improvement in agri-
culture.  Of this not only his own estate in this parish, but
the numerous estates belonging to the Earl of Eglintoune,
in the counties of Ayr, Lanerk, and Renfrew, all under his
management, are a sufficient demonstration.  Persevering
with uncommon firmness in combating the prejudices of old
tenants, dividing the lands and making restrictions suitable
to the soil and situation, he has rendered the farmers, in ge-
neral, more wealthy and respectable, and the lands much
more valuable.  To Mr M'Kerrel of Hillhouse, the country
is under great obligations in another line.  He was the first
who introduced the silk manufactory into Paisley, and his
sons still carry it on to a considerable extent.  Colonel Ful-
lerton of Fullerton, and Major Crawfurd of Newfield, par-
ticularly distinguished themselves in the East Indies.

   Fuel.-This parish is well situated for fuel.  Shoualton
