   Character and Manners.-No objection can be made against
their natural parts and abilities, which are subtle and ingenious.
They are fond of their own country, and are not much addict-
ed to enlisting in the army or navy.  They marry young, and
are greatly connected by intermarriages, which must always
be the case with insular situations; and yet they are very kind
to all strangers, who come to reside among them, or visit them.
They are in general as contented with their situation as most
people, as they have the comforts and conveniences of life in a
reasonable degree.  The Gaelic is the general language of the
common people; yet English is pretty well understood, and
taught in all our school.  The dance and the song, with
shinty and putting the stone, are their chief amusements.
Numbers of them play well on the violin and bagpipe.  They
have a natural ease and gracefulness of motion in the dance,
which is peculiar to themselves.  The gentlemen, once a year,
treat the ladies with a ball, where cheerfulness and propriety
of conduct, always preside; and more elegance of manners
are to be seen, than could well be expected in so remote a
situation.
