I have heard repeated, it seems to have been formerly 6
or 7 miles in length.

     Calder wood was fair to see,
     When it went to Cameltree;
     Calder wood was fairer still,
     When it went to Crosswood hill.

   The town of Mid-Calder is pleasantly situated, and
many of the scenes and prospects, which the wood pre-

from the shelter, which the trees afford.  The greater
part of the parish is enclosed, and divided inot fields of a
moderate extent, by stone walls, or by hedge and ditch.

   Agriculture.-The old Scotch plough, which is very

and 2 oxen, is now, in general, laid aside, and a light one
made use of, which is drawn by 2 horses only, and, in
some instances, by 2 oxen, without any horse whatso-

   The Scotch plough requires 2 persons to attend it,
but 1 is deemed sufficient for that which is drawn by 2

heavy soil; but in that which is of a light quality, it is
not reckoned to do a great deal less work, than that in
which 4 horses are employed.
   For improving the lands, summer fallowing is be-
come a very common practice, together with sowing
