     Statistical Account

town of Paisley and Abbey parish: Institutions that have be-
come highly necessary since the introduction of the cotton
spinning, which engages children before they have got al-
most any education of any kind, and which occupies them
from morning to night throughout the week.
   Occasional collections are made for the poor in seasons of
scarcity, or times of particular distress.  And to the honour
of the more affluent inhabitants of the town and Abbey pa-
rish, let it be acknowledged, that every plan to supply the
wants, or mitigate the distresses of the indigent or destitute,
has always met with their hearty concurrence, and most li-
beral support.
