servants receive about 5 l. per annum of wages; women about
2 l.; labourers in husbandry, 1 s. per day, or 6 d. and their
victuals.  Peats from the moss, of which a certain quantity is
allotted to each farm, are chiefly used for fuel.  The roads
are in good repair.  The statute labour is partly performed
in kind, and partly commuted.  The best arable land is rented
at about 15 s. per acre.  The number of farms is not dimi-
nishing.  There are few inclosures*.
