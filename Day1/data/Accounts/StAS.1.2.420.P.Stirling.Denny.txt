     NUMBER XXXVII.

     PARISH OF DENNY.

     (COUNTY OF STIRLING.)

     By the Rev. MR. THOMAS FERGUS.

     Name, Situation, etc.

   The origin of the name of Denny is unknown.-The
parish lies in the county and presbytery of Stirling,
and synod of Perth and Stirling.-It is about 4 miles in length,
and 2 1/2 in breadth.-The soil, about the town, or village of
Denny, and indeed throughout the greater part of the parish.
is dry and sandy; bit in some places, it is wet, and has a good
deal of clay in it.-The air is reckoned pure and healthy, and
many of the people attain a good old age.  Some, however,
are much troubled with rheumatic complaints; and fevers fre-
quently prevail, and are often fatal.

   Proprietors, Agricultures, etc.-A fourth part of the pa-
rish belongs to one great proprietor, and another has a consi-
derable share of it.  The rest is the property of about 100
smaller heritors, feuers, or portioners; many of whom culti-
vate their own lands.-Of late years, the farmers make use
of a good deal of lime, which they chiefly bring from the pa-
rish of Cumbernauld, and some from the parish of Dunipace.
