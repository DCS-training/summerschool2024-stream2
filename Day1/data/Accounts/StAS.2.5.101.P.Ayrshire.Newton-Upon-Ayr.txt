enabled, by means of the revenue derived from their coal-works,
to free themselves from their difficulties. It should also be men-
tioned, that in 1778, they purchased the right of patronage to their
church from the patroness of Monkton and Prestwick. This is
still held by them, and exercised in a peculiar manner. They
are obliged to elect annually thirteen of their number, who are
called delegates. Upon these delegates devolves the management
of the secular affairs of the church; and in the case of a vacancy
they have the sole power of electing a minister, and granting a pre-
sentation-but nine out of the thirteen must concur in the choice.
	The church, which was built in 1778, was lately enlarged, and
now affords accommodation for 1032 persons. There are no free
sittings. The manse was built in 1787, and repaired in 1827.
The glebe contains 6 1/2 acres, including the ground occupied by
the garden, manse, and offices, and may be valued at L. 15 a year.
The stipend amounts only to L. 60, with L. 5, for a cow's grass.
But L. 90 is allowed by Government; and a gratuity, besides, is
given by the freemen out of the proceeds of the seat-rents, which
is at present L. 95; so that the amount annually received by the
incumbent is L. 250. There is also an allowance of L. 8 for sa-
cramental expenses. The glebe was inclosed two years ago with a
wall at a considerable expense; and a garden wall is at present
building.
	There is no other church, nor any dissenting chapel in the pa-
rish. Three-fourths of the population belong to the Established
Church; so that the accommodation provided for them is very in-
adequate, especially when it is taken into account that a conside-
rable proportion of the congregation is extra-parochial.  The fol-
lowing table, with which the writer has been favoured by his pre-
decessor, exhibits the, classification of the inhabitants of the pa-
rish according to their religious profession, with the number of
sittings possessed by them respectively in their places of worship.
It is the result of a survey made in December 1835, and January
1836.
