other.  By this means, the farmers have it in their power to
confine the cattle, through the winter, to the fields where they
can do least harm by poaching; the water is mostly drained
from the surface; and the ground is, in some degree, shelten-
ed by the hedges from the severity of the winter cold and
storms.  This, along with the  other improvements made upon
the soil, has rendered the grounds much more productive and
fruitful than ever they were in any former period, probably 3
or 4 times at least.  In consequences, however, of this method of
inclosure with thorn hedges, sheep are nearly banished from
this country; nor is there any individual who can venture to
keep any considerable number of them, at least, of the wilder
sorts; though the larger or tamer breeds might perhaps be us-
ed to advantage.

   Manures.-From the nature of the soil in general through
this parish, it is better calculated for producing grain, than feed-
ing black cattle.  In consequence of this, the improvements are
principally directed to the meliorating of the soil, and preparing
it for the plough.  As no marle of any kind has a yet been found,
the manures mad e use of, are only the dung collected in the
town, or at the different farms, together with coal-ashes and
lime:  Some small quantities of horn shavings also have 
occasionally been brought from Ireland, and raised good crops
for two or three years, without injuring the soil:  The ashes
do well enough for a year or two, upon a sandy soil, but are
prejudicial where there is clay:  and it is only near the town
where there can be had; so that, all that the farmer has to de-
pend on, is the dung made on his own farm, and lime.  Of
the last, there is some in the higher parts of the parish; but
the greater part of what is used, is brought from the neighbour-
hood, at the distance of a few miles.  Fifty bolls of shells,
or 100 bolls of shakes lime is commonly laid on, per acre,
