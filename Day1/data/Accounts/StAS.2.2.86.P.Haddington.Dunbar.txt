of crops to be equal in value, that will make no difference on the
average gross amount of raw produce,-which, from the extent of
land in the parish, and the rotation of cropping, may be calculated
thus; Deduct from the whole parish 100 acres for roads and hedges,
and 300 acres of links, which are not allowed to be ploughed, and
then there will remain 6797 acres, which are either occupied as
follows, or with some other produce equally valuable.

   The average of the grain is taken from the examination of Mr
Brodie of Thornton Loch, before a committee of the House of
Lords in 1814; and the price is the average of the Haddington
fiars for the last seven years. Bone manure having enabled the
hill farmer to raise turnips, their price has fallen in the low lands.
   Manufactures.-The expectations formed of the flax mill erect.
ed at West Barns in 1792 were not realized; and the cotton factory
established at Belhaven in 1815 was-also a failure. Both of these
undertakings were productive of loss to the parties concerned, and
introduced many paupers into the parish. Such factories can only
exist advantageously where numbers of persons in manufacturing
employments are congregated together, and such a population and
that of a rich agricultural district have never been found to harnio-
nize.-There are two foundering here, which manufacture machi-
nery of various kinds. Mr Sked, the proprietor of one of them, is
celebrated for his steam-engines.-Dunbar was of old famous for
its malt. It is equally so at present for its ale.
   Navigation.-The same causes which have depressed shipping
everywhere else, have affected that of Dunbar,-so that now it is
not equal there to what it was in 1792, when there were sixteen
vessels of 1505 tons burthen in all, besides two Greenland ships
of 675 tons. At present there are eighteen small vessels, of only
1233 tons burthen in all, three of which are chiefly employed in fo-
reign, and the others in the coast trade. The subjoined state-
ments may give an idea of the trade of the port.
