lying in the outer harbour, which would admit ships of 300
tons.  Every person may conceive in a moment of what ad-
vantage this would be to the trade of Saltcoats, where the
vessels now frequently lie for several weeks before they can
receive their loading; while, in the mean time, perhaps the
price of coals is high at Dublin, and an English sleet of col-
liers arrives there before them, and brings down the price
three or four shillings a ton.  The public benefit also would
be very considerable to the Glasgow ships, and to all other
ships checked within the bay, as they sometimes are, by wes-
terly storms.  They would then have a better place of shel-
ter to run into than under the Lady Isle, described page 3.
and at times, too, when perhaps, from the course of the
winds, that Isle was inaccessible to them.

   Of late, a more than usual attention and ardour has been
raised about this object, partly owing to the statistical inqui-
ries now going forward.  Within this fortnight, (26th May
1791), an accurate survey has been taken, and plans and esti-
mates drawn out, which state the expence of this very im-
portant improvement at only about 2000 L.  Small as this
sum may appear, it will require the assistance of public spirit-
ed persons.  It is especially worthy of the attention of the
Earl of Eglinton, who has such a particular connection
with this rising town.  The line which divides the two
parishes runs across the present harbour from east to west.
On the north or Ardrossan side, which is his Lordship's pro-
perty, there is a sheltered place for ships, nearly double the
extent of both the inner and outer harbours which front it.
The bottom of this space is rocky; but, if it were deepened by
raising the rock, which is free-stone, (and would be very use-
ful in building the new harbour), and if a quay were carried
out from the north side, till it should come not far from the
