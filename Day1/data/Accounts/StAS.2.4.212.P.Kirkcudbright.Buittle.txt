	There is no regularly built harbour at Palnackie. On one side
of the Creek where vessels used to lie, a breast-work, or tempo-
rary wooden quay, has been erected, where six vessels can be
loaded or discharged `t the same time. As the present ac-
commodation is too small for the shipping, were the quay ex-
tended along the side of the river, and on the opposite side
of the creek, it would give an additional impulse to the trade
of this port. No harbour dues are exacted. One farthing per
ton register is levied for river dues, viz. keeping up ring-bolts, moor-
ing posts, and the river road. A custom-house officer is stationed
here, and all vessels, except those engaged in foreign trade, are
cleared, both inwards and outwards.
	The following table shows the principal articles of import and
export, to and from the port of PaInackie, for the three years from
1833 to 1836, distinguishing each year.

	There are twenty vessels belonging to the river Urr, amount-
ing in all to 1303 tons burthen; and navigated by 75 seamen.
	A foot-runner, carrying the mail, passes every afternoon from
Castle Douglas, through Palnackie to Dalbeattie, and returns in
the evening.
	Ecclesiastical State.--The church stands in the centre of the
parish, and is accessible to all the inhabitants. It was built in
1819, at an expense of L.1000 Sterling, on an elevated situation
adjoining to the burying ground, and of a construction more com-
modious for the people than the old church, as well as more or-
namental to the neighbourhood. It is calculated to hold 400 sit-
ters on the ground area; and the walls are of sufficient height to
admit of galleries being erected at any future period, should the
population increase. There is no other place of worship in the
parish. The patronage of the church belongs to the crown.
