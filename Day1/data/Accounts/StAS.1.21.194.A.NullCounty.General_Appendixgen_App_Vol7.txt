     General Appendix to [Vol. vii.

The greatest encouragement therefore the board of agricul-
ture and their respectable present could give us, would be
to promote an agricultural bank in each county, at which
persons improving waste lands might be supplied with money
at a low rate of interest, on the credit of their farms, in pro-
portion to the extent of their improvements; for repayment
of which the bank might by law be declared to have a pre-

indeed on any other account.  During greatest part of the
storm of last year, while the deepest snow ever seen here was
on the ground, they were actually employed in gravelling the
roads, and it proved very comfortable work both for men
and for horses.-These improvements have been greatly en-
couraged by my liberal superiors; the town council of Aber-
deen taking care, in feuing out the lands, to free them from
all thirlage and payment of tythes, and all services, necessary
parochial ones excepted, These advantages I of course com-
municate, to my tenants: and some of them, who have got
