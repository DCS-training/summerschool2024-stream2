tants are very healthy.  Formerly, those who lived on the
low grounds are said to have been subject to aguish com-
plaints, which, no doubt, arose from their vicinity to moss
and marsh, and the stagnation of water from the overflow-
ing of the Eden, which sometimes covered a great part of
the valley.  But of late years, the mosses and marshes have
been much drained, and in this neighbourhood the Eden
confined within its banks, by a new straight cut or channel,
and the aguish complaints are less frequent.  From the Lo-
monds, on all sides, issue springs and small streams of the
purest and most wholsome water, so that the inhabitants en-
joy in great perfection that necessary of life, and most salu-
tary beverage.
   The Lomonds are the only hills which deserve no-
tice, and that not from their natural magnitude, but
their relative situation and appearance.  As being the
highest ground of the county, they command a very exten-
sive and variegated prospect into many neighbouring and
distant counties, and are seen by travellers, in some direc-
tions, at a very great distance.  The eastern, which is the
most regular and beautiful, is said to be about 550 yards
above the level of the plain already mentioned; and
where it is most accessible, seems to have been fortified near
the top, with a deep trench, for what purpose, there is no
record or tradition.  Very near the highest part of the hill,
there is a small cavity, about a foot and an half diameter,
which, in rainy weather, collects some water, and is called
by the common people a spring or well, but by some tra-
vellers a volcanic crater; and the stones immediately under
the northern summit, though common to the whole ridge,
and without any appearance of calcination or vitrification,
are carried away in triumph, and exhibited as specimens of
volcanic lava found in the eastern Lomond.  The western
hill is considerably higher, and has on its top a large heap
of loose stones, or a cairn , such as is found on many hills
