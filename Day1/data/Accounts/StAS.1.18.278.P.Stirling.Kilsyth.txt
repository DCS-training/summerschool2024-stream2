ble, while the present leases last, the valley must lie open,
and uninclosed; and, therefore, continue to be poached all
the winter: for this cause it is, that the worst, that is the
high lying cold ground, which is allotted for pasture, is all
inclosed:  while the low, warm, rich valley, lies open; a
circumstance this, which is surely very uncommon in the pre-
sent period.
   It is chiefly owing to this circumstance, that every farmer
is in some measure a grazier, though there are but few who
follow that line to any great extent; at the same time, it is
much more attended to, than it was 40 or 50 years ago.  Be-
fore the rebellion 1745, a great proportion, perhaps one tenth
of the arable part of the parish, was cultivated.  From the
valley to the very brow of the hills, upwards of 800 feet a-
bove the level of the sea, almost every inclosure was ploughed
in regular rotation.  Whereas now, it is very uncommon to
see one acre in 20 of those high grounds cultivated.  The
reason is obvious, and every one who looks at the grounds
must see it.  The fields are steep, and of course, very expen-
sive in the culture: every plough requires 4, in some
places would require 6 horses, and never less than two
men.  After all this labour and expence, the produce must
be scanty, and the harvest late; in some cases so late, as to
endanger the crop, if not ruin it altogether.  Besides, as
lime is at a considerable distance, and the roads bad, and as
dung cannot be conveyed from the valley, where the farm
houses in general now stand, there is little probability of im-
proving them to much advantage.  For the expence of seed,
labour, and manure, it is feared, would exceed the produce;
the high wages of men servants, the advanced price of horses,
and of every utensil that is necessary, and the amazing ex-
pence of carrying manure in sufficient quantities to those high
fields, are circumstances sufficient to discourage the farmer
