rouse them into action.  Improvements have been, and still
are, carried on with ardour and success.  The discovery of
marle has wonderfully conributed to the improvements in
agriculture.

   Fuel.-Amidst the many advantages which the people
here enjoy, the want of fuel is a great inconvenience.  They
generally use peats, of which there are plenty in different
mosses; but they are dug at a considerable expence, and will
soon be exhausted.  Some transport coals from Dundee, the
nearest sea-port town, which is twelve miles distant from
Glammiss.  This defect, however, will in a short time be
supplied by the extensive woods planted by the late Earl of
Strathmore, which are in a very thriving condition, and are
a great ornament to the country.

   Diseases.-The air is rather moist, and neither very heal-
thy, nor very unhealthy.  Agues and melancholy habits
are not much known here.  Fevers and consumptions are
the most prevalent distempers, owing, it is supported, to the
moisture occasioned by the hills to the south, and the great
quantity of planting.  We have no mineral springs of any
consequence.

   Rivers and Fishes.-The river Dean, a deep running water,
is supplied from the lake of Forfar.  The Kerbet, and the
burn of Glammiss, run through the parish, and abound with
plenty of fine red trout.  There is a very considerable lake
in the east end of the parish, near Forfar, called the Loch of
Forfar.  It originally contained 140 acres, but 60 of these
have been drained, and a great quantity of marle and peat
have been dug out, which has proved very advantageous to
the Earl of Strathmore, the proprietor.  When the lake
