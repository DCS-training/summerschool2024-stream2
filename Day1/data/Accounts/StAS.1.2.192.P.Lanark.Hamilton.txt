of goofe-berries and currants, produced here, are sent to the
Glasgow market.
   Forest trees, of all kinds, capable of standing the climate
of Scotland, thrive in the lower parts of the parish.  Some of
them attain to a great size.  On poor land, in high exposures,
the larix, since it has been introduced, has thriven better
than any other.  Next to it, is the Scots fir.  Scarcely any o-
ther kind of wood has succeeded in the high ground except
the birch.  At the same time, the beech, the ash, and the
plane, will stand the severest exposure, when they have a suf-
ficient depth of dry soil.
   It has been already stated, that the parish is mostly inclosed,
that is to say, the fields are in general surrounded with earthen
mounds dug out of a trench, in the face of which, a row of
white thorn has been planted:  But it is rare thing, excepting
in the best foils and most sheltered places, and in many places
there are not ten yards in fifty.  The thorns, when the soil, in
which they are planted, is in any degree tolerable, make
shoots for a few years; but the bank of hard unproductive
earth, to which they are confined, affording them little nou-
rishment, and, at the same time, secluding them from the be-
neficial influences of the fun and air, they become stunted,
and, at length, are smothered up, in many places, with a
coat of shaggy gray moss growing all over them.  The defi-
ciency requires to be perpetually made up by repeated supplies
of dead fence.  Much of the under soil in this parish is, no
doubt, unfriendly to the growth of quickset hedges, but pro-
bably the manner of planting is not less unfavourable.  Hed-
ges planted on the top of a bank, of the best soil, gathered from
the surface, generally succeed better, and it is only in that
situation, that quickset hedges continue to be permanent
