cairns of stones upon them, and bear marks of great anti-
quity. In the great cairn of Mauldslie Law, there was
lately found an urn, of a round, or rather oval form, in
which had been deposited the bone, of a human being.  In
digging high the top of the hill, great quantities of ashes and
burnt materials were found.  On the S. W. corner of the hill,
there is a place which still remains the name of Gallowlie.
There, the gallow, stood, on which, during that reign of the
feudal system, the ancient barons were wont to execute of-
fenders. The prison, with a dark subterraneous vault under
it, stood near the top of the hill.  If these Laws as they are
called, there are no less than 6 in the parish those of
Mauldslie, Carluke,Killuisao, Ganby, King's and Cock Laws.
From the King's Law on the N. E. corner of the parish, a
part of 13 or 14 shire may be seen, when the atmosphere is
favourable. On Mauldslie Law, there were more cairns than
one. In the greater part of those above mentioned, human
bones have been found by the farmers, in urns of different
sizes.

in the more remote villages, appear to be, the constant drain
to the manufacturing towns of Glasgow, Paisley, &c.; the
number of hands employed in the coal iron, and cotton works
in the neighbourhood, and the inclination which many farm-
ers, in the decline of life, now have, to lay out what money
they may have saved, on building houses adjoining to the public
roads, or in such villages as these roads run through, where
something may be easily gained, and their money better se-
cured, than in the hands of their brother farmers, of whom
many, of late, have failed. There are indeed many farm-
houses built lately in this parish, on new improvements. But
