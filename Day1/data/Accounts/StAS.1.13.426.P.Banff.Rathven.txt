yarn is in general the daily labour of the spinner, for which
she recieves only 3 d.- Tarwathie was, in former times,
the watch-word for convening the Enzie-men in times of
danger; or at markets, and other places of public report,
when any of them happened to be engaged in a fray.
   There are 2 annual fairs in the parish, the one in July for
cattle, sheep, and merchant goods, and the other in Sep-
tember, for butter and cheese.  Both are named Peter-

   The house of Buckie was burnt in the civil wars.  Since
the beginning of this century, the fluctuation of property
in land has been very considerable.  Lord Findlater has
purchased, at different times, Catlefield from the Dun-
bas; Farskane from the Gordons; Findochtie from the
Ords; Muldavat and Rannes from the Hays.  Mr Baron
Gordon is proprietor of Freuchnie, Buckie and Gollachie;
the first purchased from the Hays; the second from the
Gordons; and the last obtained from the Duke of Gordon,
in exchange for other lands.  Mr Gordon of Letterfourie
has bought Corrydown from the Roffes; and Walkerdales
from the Gordons of Aberlour.  Mr Dunbars estate of
Nether Buckie was lately the property of the Gordons,
Mr Gordon of Cairnfield has acquired Thornybank from
the Hays; Arradoul from the Andersons; Easter-Bogs
from the Stuarts; and Birkenbush from the Gordons.  The
Duke of Gordon has purchased Coussurach; Reston hil-
lock, Litcheistown and Clastirum from the Gordons; Ho-
mie from the Patersons; and Middle Bogs from the Reids.
Oxhill is, of late, in possession of the son-in-law of the for-
mer proprietor*.
