     Statistical Account

manufactures, though going on so briskly in the neighbour-
hood, have as yet made no progress in this parish*.

   Population.-The return to Dr Webster in 1755, from Wis-
toun, was 591, and from Robertoun, 511; in all, 1102 souls.
In spring 1791, there were risiding in the united parish 740
persons, 370 males, and 370 females.  The number of fami-
lies was 182, which at an average is about 4 persons to a fa-
mily; 27 of these families consisted of single persons.  There
were 214 married persons; 54 widowers and widows; about
140 under 9 or 10 years of age; several persons about 80,-
one 82,-one 83,-one 85,-and one 88, years old.  Each
of these parishes seems to have been as populous, or nearly so,
50 or 60 years ago, as the united parish now is.  This opini-
on is grounded on the register of births and marriages, which
about that period seems to have been pretty accurated kept, and
on the accounts of old persons in the parish.  The decrease is ea-
sily accounted for:-from one farmer now occupying what se-
veral had occupied formerly;-from arable land being con-
verted into store or sheep farms;-from a greater number of
cattle and horses being reared;-and from people of late years,
particularly young persons, removing to places where there
are manufactures and public works.  Hence one cause of the
great proportion of deaths, by a number of old people being
left in the parish, while their children remove.-For 4 years
preceding 1792, the yearly average of births in the united pa-
rish is 15; of marriages, 7; and of deaths, 16.  In 1791, 11
were born, and 21 died: since the commencement of 1792,
4 have been born, and 11 have died.  From so few years no
certain calculation can be made: however, it evidently appears

*The wages of servants and day-labourers have risen much of late, on ac-
count of the great demand for hands at the public works and manufactories.
