     III. HISTORY AFTER THE REFORMATION.

   THE reformation in religion, established by act of Parlia-
ment in the year 1560, brought the University of Glasgow al-
most to annihilation.  The dignitaries of the church and con-
vents, of whom its doctors and masters were composed, were
no more.  The chancellor, JAMES BEATON, fled to France;
and carried with him the plate of the cathedral, with the bulls,
charter, and rights, both of the fee and of the University;
which he deposited partly in the convent of the Carthusians,
and partly in the Scotch College at Paris, (where they lately
were), to be restored when Popery should be re-established.-
It ought to be observed, to the honour of that college, that
they have always been ready to give extracts from the originals
deposited with them, as well as to gratify the curious by the
inspection of them.  The late Principal Gordon, of that col-
lege, made a present to the University of Glasgow of a copy of
the chartulary of the chapter of Glasgow, notorially attested.
   All that was now to be seen of the University was that small
part, called the College of Arts, or P‘dagogium; the least in dig-
nity, though perhaps not the least useful.  This small part,
with its small property, probably much impaired by the con-
tution of the times, and the loss of rights,-remained as a re-
lie of the ancient University, and the seed of a reformed U-
niversity; dependent for its subsistence and growth on future
benefactions.-The rich fabric of the popish hierarchy, in
Scotland, was pulled down with more zeal than prudence, by
a fierce nation, long oppressed, and little accustomed to regu-
lar government.  All who had power or interest scrambled
for the wreck.  The Crown, the nobility, and the cities, were
enriched by it: some crumbs came, by second hand, to the
universities.
