     Statistical Account

   Antiquities.-1. About a mile to the west of Barnbougle
Castle, on the top of a high sea bank, is an ancient cairn,
called by the country people the Earl Cairny, of a circular
shape, 500 feet in circumferrence, and 24 high in the middle;
raised perhaps for the purpose of a sepulchral monument.
The stones are all small, consisting of granite, whin-stone,
quartz, iron-stone, and lime-stone, and appear to have been
carried to it by the hand from the neighbouring grounds.  A
portion only of the cairn now remains; the greater part of
the stones having been taken away.  2. In that part of the
parish which lies at the west end of Queensferry, close by the
shore, are the remains of a monastery, founded about the
1330 by one of the lairds of Dundas, for Carmelite Friars.
The church, a small building in a very plain Gothic style, is
still nearly entire.  3. Near a mile to the west of this, upon
a high sea bank, where a farm house now stands, there were,
about 40 or 50 years since, considerable ruins of probably an
old Roman speculatorium, consisting of a large carved window,
a square pillar, and a very considerable quantity of hewn
stones, which, it is said, were carried to Dunkirk.  There
were found several silver medals of Marcus Antoninus, with
a Victory on the reverse; also, the carved handle of a copper
vessel, and the bottom of an earthen urn, with the word ad-
jecti; the rest obliterated.

   Antient Families, and Eminent Men.-1. The family of
Dundas of Dundas, from which that of Arniston, and others,
are derived, has been traced by genealogists* back to the
Saxon Kings of England; and that family has uninterrupted-
ly enjoyed a great estate in this parish, in the male line, for near
700 years.  The present proprietor is the 24th in descent from
