These 749 milk-cows are kept by 177 people; there are ten
principal dairies, which consist of betwixt 14 to 20 milk
cows; the remainder are split down in small dairies, contain-
ing from 4 to 10 cows.  It is not easy to say what milk at an
average is given per day by the cows of this district; I should
think from 7 to 11 Scotch pints; below 7 they are not thought
worth keeping for the dairy: above 11 they are considered
as remarkable.
   About 60 of those persons who have cows, may be consi-
dered as tradesmen and manufacturers; it may be doubt-
ed, whether it be of any use to such a person to keep a
cow or not; some are apt to imagine that it is calculated
to instill habits of idleness into the minds of their children,
who may be employed in herding them by the dykes-side:
no doubt, it will be considered as an eye-sore by the far-
mers, to allow the children of tradesmen to feed their cows
on the road-side, to the prejudice of his turnips and pease; on
the other hand, it is of the utmost importance to the state at
large, that the children of tradesmen and sedentary people
should be healthy:  I know of nothing more calculated to
promote that end than plenty of fresh milk.  Our milk cows,
within these 30 years, have increased considerably in bulk;
at an average, if fattened, they would weigh 20 stones, Tron
weight.  In general, they are the breed of Highland bulls
hence they have a tendency to take on flesh, more than to
