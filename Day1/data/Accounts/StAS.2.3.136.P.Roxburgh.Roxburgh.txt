ment is likely to take place in this respect, by the introduction of
bone manure, which is found highly suitable for raising turnips,
and of which not less than 500 quarters were used in the year
1832. There may be a little difference of appearance in the
parish, from the greater space occupied by crop now than for-
merly. Such occupation, however, is not believed to be consider-
able, and has in some instances after trial been abandoned. The
number of sheep reared renders pasture valuable, so that land
which might be cropped with a certain degree of profit is found
to be more profitable when in pasture, especially after an occa-
sional tillage with improvement. It is perhaps worthy of remark,
that the crops now raised are, beyond all doubt, much more pro-
ductive and profitable than formerly.
    The facilities of internal communication are, however, limited,
and form the greatest barrier to improvement. This may be in-
ferred from the fact, that while the land in this county is better
than in most other counties, the climate good, and the husbandry
highly improved, nevertheless the fiars prices for grain are among
the very lowest in Scotland. This fact cannot be accounted for
by the inferior quality of the grain, (for the reverse is the truth,)
but by the great quantity produced above what is necessary for
home consumption. This is carted chiefly to Berwick for the
London market. The price of such carriage is regularly de-
ducted from the returns given in by the witnesses on the fiars,
and hence the low fiars price of corn. For the purpose of afford-
ing, increased facilities of internal communication, it has been pro-
posed to form a railway from this district to Berwick, and consider-
able progress has been made towards its accomplishment.
