*The following character of the people, drawn up by a friend of the incum-
bent's, does not seem to err, on, what is too commonly the case, the side of par-
tiality; and it is therefore given, as in general the clergy are accused of having
transmitted accounts, rather too favourable, of the manners and morals of their
parishioners.

Character of the People.-"They are sometines accused of being given to
"change; but many instances of steady and unshaken friendship are not want-
"ing.  In professions of kindness they are profuse; and their sincerity, in gene-
"ral, is more to be depended on, than is usual on such occasions.  They are
"inquisitive, but (more especially after having had the advantage of some in-
"tercourse with the world at large), distinguished by the politeness of their
"manners, and the insinuation of their address:  Fond of sauntering in idleness,
"but less addicted to a roving life than heretofore:  Though poor, inclined to
"indolence; and though naturally sagacious and intelligent, yet not in general
"learned:  Less revengeful and implacable than formerly, and, now, more dis-
"posed to determine matters by litigation, than by arms; family dissensions
"imbitter not their lives, as in the feudal times.  Impatient of restraint; yet,
"when under a proper leader, in whom they have confidence, invincible by
"fatigue, cold, or hunger:  Intrepid, equal to any race of men ever known,
"in the midst of the greatest dangers:  Less hospitable than of old, (indeed
"the old exertions of hospitality are not now so necessary as formerly;) but
"when feasts are prepared, the cheer is good; Spirited in a high degree to
"promote works of public utility.  Charitable and willing to relieve the dis-
"tressed, as far as their circumstances will admit of:  Though no strangers to
"the power and influence of religion, yet rather apt to undervalue its holy
"ordinances:  Fond of spirituous liquors, yet seldom habitual drunkards:
"They deserve praise for their continence; but are rather addicted to swear-
"ing.-These are some of the predominant traits; and though there must be
"a great variety of character among 4,225 persons, yet there are, in this dis-
"trict, no inconsiderable proportion of persons, distinguished by their gene-
"rosity, humanity, disinterestedness, benevolence, hospitality, temperance, piety,
"and religion."
