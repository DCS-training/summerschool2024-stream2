hedge rows of different ages, which both give beauty and
warmth to the fields.
   In the garden belonging to Pitlethie, once stood one of the
hunting seats of James the VI.  King of Scotland; which had
been taken down to a little below the surface, and thus ren-

removing the earth, the foundation of this hunting seat was
discovered to a great depth and thickness.  This was carefully

port, that this part of the parish was peopled by the crews of
a Danish fleet wrecked on the coast.  I presume, that the

many years past, and has left what seems to me strong proofs
of having once flowed and ebbed on those grounds.  The
name seems to have been founded in that caution and oeco-
nomy with which men take possession of property they are
not sure of holding; for when the people took their station
where the sea formerly made her furrowed bed, they must
