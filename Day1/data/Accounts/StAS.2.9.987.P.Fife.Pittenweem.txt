      long to the town, and a considerable number of fishing boats;-but
      as Anstruther Easter has a better harbour, the shipping is chiefly
      connected with that port.
         There are grain mills belonging to the town, but which are let
      out to a tenant. At one period there were no less than thirty
      breweries in the burgh, but at present there is only one.
         Rental.-The valued rent of the parish is L.2452 Scots. The
      annual value of real property in 1815 was  L.1712 Sterling, of
      which L.1127 was assessed on the burgh, and L.585 Sterling on
      the landward part of the parish.

      The stipend is L.166, ls. 10d. The yearly value of the glebe
      is L.12, 12s.  The church is apparently of a very old date, and is
      supposed to have formed part of a priory which formerly existed
      here.
         Education.-The parochial schoolmaster has a school-house,
      dwelling-house, and garden; the salary is the maximum.  The
      average number of scholars is ninety.
         There is, besides, an unendowed school, at which there may be
      about the same number of pupils; and a female school, sup-
      ported merely by subscription, with an attendance of from sixty
      to eighty pupils.
