     Statiscal Account

     Yet nevertheless I am content,
     And ne'er a whit my love repent;
     But think my time it was well spent,
     Though I disdained be.

     
     The shall'est water makes maist dio,
     The deepest pool the dealest lin,
     The richest man least truth within,
     Though he disdained be.

     
     O Helen fair, without compare,
     I'll wear a garland of thy hair,
     Shall cover me for ever mair,
     Until the day I die.

     
     O Helen sweet, and maist complete,
     My captive spirit's at thy feet,
     Think'st thou still fit thus for to treat,
     Thy Pris'ner with cruelty.

     
     O Helen brave! this still I crave,
     On thy poorslave some pity have,
     And do him save, that's near his grave,
     And dies for love of thee.

     
     Curst be the hand that shot the shot,
     Likewise the gun that gave the crack,
     Into my arms bird Helen lap,
     And died for love of me.

     
     O think na'ye my heart was fair,
     My love sank down, and spak na mair,
     There did she swoon wi' meikle cair,
     On fair Kirkconnell lee.

     
     I lighted down, my sword did draw,
     I cutted him in pieces sma',
     I cutted him in pieces sma',
     On fair Kirkconnell lee.

     
     O Helen chaste; thou wert modest,
     Were I with thee I would he blest,
     Where thou ly'st low, and tak'st thy rest
     On fair Kirkconnell lee.
