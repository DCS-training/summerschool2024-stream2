		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name, Extent, Boundaries, 8c.--THIS parish has borde, at dif-
ferent periods, the names of Dudrennan, Monkton, and Rerwick,
or Rerrick. The first of these appellations is derived from the
Irish words Dun Drainan, signifying the Hill of Thorns-while.
according to Symson, whose account of Galloway was compiled in
1684, the parish was called Moukton, from the monks who dwelt
in the Abbey of Dundrennan. Chalmers again, in his Caledonia,
while he admits Rerrick to be a name of difficult etymology, con-
siders it as an " abbreviated pronunciation of Rerwick, which
was derived from a wirk, or creek of Solway at this place."+ This
can scarcely be considered a satisfactory account of the origin of
