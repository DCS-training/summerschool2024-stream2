Since the year 1774 there has been a regular assessment in the
parish, and tbe collections at the church door have, of course, been
trifling. Taking the two years before Bannockburn and Plean
were separated from us, the collections were,

Education.--There are 19 schools in the parish, of which
one is parochial, with the legal accommodations; and three others
are slenderly endowed, one by a mortification, and the other two by
the bounty of a benevolent lady. The branches generally taught
are reading, writing, and accounts. Besides these branches, Latin,
Greek, French, geography, and mathematics, are taught in the pa-
rish school, where an assistant is kept. The salary is the maximum,
and the school fees vary from 2s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. There are two
or three places, in the remote parts of the parish, in great need of
schools. The people are too few, and too poor, either to build a
school-house or to support a teacher. Most parents are zealous
for the education of their children; but a spirit of indifference is
certainly increasing. This will be ascribed by some to the num-
bers of strangers who come amongst us to our public works--by
others to the very low wages of many workmen, sinking their spi-
rits, and rendering them careless about their children. But per-
haps the most prolific source of the evil is the wages which the
children at an early period can gain,--thus relieving the parents
of their support, and rendering them too soon independent. The
children of miners, nailers, and spinners, are most exposed to this
evil, nor can it be repaired by their attendance either at week-
day evening or Sabbath evening schools.
  Libraries.--There are several libraries in the parish, some of
them containing about 500 volumes. Those connected with parti-
cular congregations consist generally of religious publication.
There are others which admit works of general literature.
  Charitable Institutions.--The late Francis Simpson, Esq. of
East Plean, who died March 1831, nominated certain trustees,
to whom he left, in lands and money, between L. 2000 and L. 3000
of annual income, for the benefit of indigent old men; sailors and
soldiers to have a preference. The funds have already been in-
creased, and will, ere long, be still farther augmented, by certain
