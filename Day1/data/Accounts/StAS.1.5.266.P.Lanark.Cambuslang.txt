   Religious Houses.-No vestige now remains of any of
those religious houses which were in this parish, during
the times of Popery.  There was, however, on the banks
of the Kirk Burn, about 1/4 of a mile below the kirk, a
chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary, to which belonged
4 acres of land, which still retain the name of Chapel.
There was also an hospital 2 miles E. from the kirk, to
which about 130 acres of land, called Spittal and Spittal-
bill, seem to have been annexed.  But the persons by
whom, and the time when these religous houses were
founded, are equally unknown.  The parish of Cambuslang
itself, was first a rectory, and then a prebend.  John Ca-
meron, of the family of Locheil, was rector when he was
promoted to the Bishoprick of Glasgow.  In 1429, Bishop
Cameron, at the desire of the patron, Archibald Earl of
Douglas, made the parish of Cambuslang a prebend; and
at the same time, appointed the prebendary and his suc-
cessors, perpetual chancellors of the cathedral at Glasgow.
In consequence of this appointment, the prebendary was
obliged to reside at Glasgow, and to serve the cure at
Cambuslang by a vicar, who had for his support the vica-
rage teind, now valued at 100 merks, with a house and
6 acres of land, known to this day by the name of Vicar-
land+.
