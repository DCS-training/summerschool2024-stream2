ever found at one time in the parish. They were allowed, there-
fore, to accumulate, and were never encroached upon till the scar
city in 1800, already alluded to, together with other unfortunate
circumstances, greatly reduced them. They still, however, amount
to a considerable sum.
   There have been three manses since Westruther became a pa-
rish. Of the first, the only relic that remains is the foundation-stone,
a large shapeless block of whinstone, inscribed with the initials of
John Veitch, 1649. These three manses have stood all nearly on
the same site, although they have been successively withdrawn a few
yards farther south from the road,-which is now felt to be an advan-
tage, from its admitting a small plantation, that adds to the beauty
and comfort of the place. The present one was built in 1819. The
expense of the building, L. 584, 18s. It is a commodious and
comfortable house, and is furnished with excellent offices.
   The glebe consists of rather more than twenty acres, of which
there may be four that lie constantly in pasture; the rest is good
arable land, particularly the east part of it, on which excellent wheat
is often raised. It varies much in the quality of the soil; but its
general value, in the eyes of practical farmers, is estimated from
about L-25 to L. 30 a-year. Its extent, which is larger than the legal
allotment, was probably occasioned by the state of the western
part of it, which formed originally a branch of West ruther common:
on that common the minister had, with others, the right of pasturage
at his pleasure, and a large portion of it was assigned to him in
lieu of the extensive privilege he resigned. The stipend of West-
ruther was fixed at 1000 merks by decreet of locality dated 8th
March 1693. In 1755 it was L. 63, 12s. 10d. In 1798 it amount-
ed to L. 105, 16s. 8d. Sterling. It was raised to L. 150 when the
Government bounty was extended to Scotland, which, together
with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements, and L. 2, 10s. for giving
up the right of casting turf on Bassendean estate, makes the total
amount of the minister's stipend L. 160, 16s. 8d.
   The number of dissenters is computed at 34, all of whom
belong to what was originally called the Secession. The parish
church itself is very well attended. The average number of com-
municants is 420. The collection at the sacrament in 1833 was
L. 2, 14s. 3 1/2d., and the total amount of contributions during that
year was L. 17, 18s. 3 3/4d.
   Education.-There seems to have been a parish school here
ever since there was a church. The school, however, was kept
in the western gallery of the church till about the first quarter of
