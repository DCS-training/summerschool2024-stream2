Peebles road upon the east, and the Kirkcurd road upon the
west.  This road is completely finished, and is of great ad-
vantage to travellers coming from the west country by the
way of Peebles.  There is also a bridge over Bigger Water,
which is the boundary on the west between this parish and
Glenholm.  This bridge opens up a free communication be-
tween this parish and the road leading to Moffat.
