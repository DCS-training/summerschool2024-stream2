wards escaped to England; and after the Revolution became minis-,
ter of Peebles, and thereafter of Dumfries. *
   In 1669, Mr Donald Cargill, one of the most distinguished friends
of freedom, whose persecutions were as remarkable as his conduct
was courageous, preached his last sermon on Dunsyre common.  He,
went, though contrary to the advice of his friends, to Andrew Fisher's,
at Covington Mill, where next day he was seized by Irvine of Bon-
shaw.  He was treated in the most ignominious manner; his back
was turned to the horse's head, his feet tied below its belly; and in
this manner he was led through the streets of Lanark.  He was
afterwards hanged in the Grassmarket of Edinburgh, his head
struck off and fixed on the Netherbow port.
   There are several places in the moor which still go by the 'name
of preaching holes, and which formed the retreat of the persecuted
preachers.  Into these they generally retired, while the congrega-
tions dispersed at the approach of the persecutors.

   The decrease has been owing to the union of small farms, and
the dislike which the farmers entertain towards what are generally
denominated cottars.
