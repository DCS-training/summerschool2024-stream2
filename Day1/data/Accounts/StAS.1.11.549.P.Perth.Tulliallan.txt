     of Tulliallan.

is a man living, who knew 42 pikemen, and their bearers,
employed in it.  The coals, at that time, were either sold to
the country, or consumed by the pans; none of them were
exported; but after the shipping increased, they carried them
to Dundee, Perth, etc.  Though there is abundance of coals
to work, and a steam engine was erected, nothing has been
done for a number of years.  There were formerly 35 salt
pans in this parish, 14 of which have been in ruins beyond the
memory of any man living.  Their foundations were lately
dug up, and there is not a vestige of them to be seen.  About
60 years ago, there were 21 in the parish, 6 at New Pans, and
15 at West Pans, now called Kincardine.  The author has
known 18 of them working at one time.  The proprietor
furnished each pan with 36 small cart loads of coals in the
week; and for these the salter was obliged to produce 4
draughts of salt, each draught containing 14 firlots of Lin-
lithgow barley mere.  The produce of the whole pans,
(supposing them to go constantly), was 252 bolls in the week,
and 13,104 bolls in the year; which were sold at 48 s. the boll,
amounting to 2,620 l. 16 s. But after the duty was laid upon
it by act of parliament it was sold at 2 s. the bushel. The
wages paid to the salter, were a peck of oatmeal, at 8 4/12 d, the
peck, and what salt he had more than his 14 firlots from his
draught; and, when cleaning the bucket, pots, etc., he had
only 4 d. per day.  The whole of these pans are in ruins, ex-
cepting two, which work but little; for as the coal is not work-
ing, the pan wood must be carried from the Alloa collieries
to Alloa shore, and from thence to Kincardine, by water,
which makes it very dear.  The salt is at present selling here
at 4 s. the bushel.  A firlot of salt, taken from the pan, weighs
58 lb. or a bushel and 2 lb.  After it hath lain some time in
the granary, it will weigh 63 lb. or a bushel and 7 lb.
