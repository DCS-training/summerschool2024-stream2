     of Glasserton.

   Swine.-Swine are fed in considerable numbers, by the
farmers and cottagers in this parish.  They are nourished
chiefly upon the refuse of potatoes, upon whey, and other
small articles, which, but for them; might probably go to
waste.  The pork is a strong wholesome food, and a season-
able supply to the labourers, in those times of the year in
which it is less usual to furnish them with fresh beef and
mutton.  They may be driven alive, even to a considerably
distant place of sale: Or, they may be fattened and slaughter-
ed at home; and the pork then pickled in barrels, or cured,
as bacon, for exportation.

   Horses.-The horses of this parish, are a stout, handsome
race, very fit for the saddle, the load, or the draught.  The
breed has been diligently improved by the care of the gentle-
men, landholders in Glasserton, and the neighbourhood.
Most of the young horses are the progeny of stallions intro-
duced into this country by the Earl of Galloway, and the late
Admiral Keith Stewart.  It is probable, that the variety of
the horse now prevalent in these parts of Galloway, has been
gradually produced by the continual crossing of the small old
Galloway breed, with foreign stallions.

   Inclosures, etc.-These are all the capital articles of farm-
stock in this perish.  Poultry, and the usual domestic ani-
mals, are kept about every farm-house and cottage.  All the
instruments of agriculture are of a construction sufficiently
skilful and convenient.  Inclosures, and the divisions of farms
and fields, are formed commonly by the Galloway stone-
dyke; which is sometimes a double wall without mortar,
and is often raised to the height of 6 or 7 quarters of an ell.
Attempts to produce hedges, for fences, have never yet been
