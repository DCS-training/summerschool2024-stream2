country so extensive, so discontinuous, so heterogeneous in
form, soil, and surface, as is the parish of Harris, even pro-
lixity of description is not easily avoided.  To render this ac-
count in some degree regular and intelligible, we must divide
the parish into three separate districts; and, proceeding in our
survey, according to the general plan of this work, from the
southern extremity northward, these are as follows: 1st, The
Southern Isles lying in the Sound of Harris.  2d, The main-
land of Harris within Tarbert.  And, 3d, The forest or out-
er hills of Harris, and the Northern Isles.

     I. Description of the South Isles of Harris.

   Of these four are inhabited, viz. Berneray, Pabbay, Calli-
gray, and Ensay.  The names of these, and almost of all the
islands about Harris, are supposed to be of Danish origin.
Their general appearance is either flat or gently sloping from
a little elevation in the middle.  Berneray, lying about a mile
N. of Uist, is a beautiful and fertile island, about 4 miles in
length, and 1 1/2 mile in breadth.  Its N. W. side is much
damaged by the breaking of sand banks.  Pabbay lies about
a league N. W. of Berneray, is of a conical appearance, and
rises to a peak considerably higher than any part of the other
islands in the Sound.  Its greatest diameter may measure
about 2 1/2 miles.  This island was once the granary of Harris,
but it has lost much of its fertility by the encroachment of
the sand drift, which now covers its S. E. side to the very
top, exhibiting a most desolate appearance.  The S. W. side
is verdant, and well cultivated.  The N. W. side, exposed to
the Atlantic, yields little or no vegetation, the spray of the
sea in stormy weather washing over it.  Within 1 1/2 league
E. from Berneray, lie the islands of Calligray and Ensay, se-
parated from each other by a narrow Sound, called Caolas
