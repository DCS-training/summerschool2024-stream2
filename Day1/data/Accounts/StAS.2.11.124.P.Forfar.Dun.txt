land becomes flattened, wet, and miry, and, except the farm of
North Mains and several small places, thd freater part of it is
under wood. On the north of Balnillo Wood is Dun's Dish, a
lake covering about forty acres of land, collected from the adjoin-
ing fields and springs for the use of mills.

                 	  II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   There is no history of the parish printed or in manuscript; nor
are there any historical occurrences worthy of notice.
   Land-owners.--The chief land-owners are the most noble Mar-
quis of Ailsa; James Cruickshank, Esq. of Langley Park; David
Carnegy, Esq. of Craigo; and Patrick Cruickshank, Esq. of Glens-
kenno.
   Parochial Registers.--The date of the earliest entry on the pa-
rochial register of births and baptisms is the 10th July 1642; of
marriages, the 14th September 1646. There are three vo-
lumes of these registers, but they do not appear to have been very
regularly kept, and the first is scarcely legible. There is also a
register of burials in the parish, begun in the year 1777, and
continued to the year 1793; but from that time it has been very
irregularly kept. The records of the kirk-session begin on the
19th July 1702, and consist of four volumes.

                  1811,                            680

          And in  1831,                            514

	The recent decrease is said to be owing to a number of cottar-
houses, and several other houses that had a few acres of land attach-
ed to them, having been taken down. There is no town or village in
the parish.
