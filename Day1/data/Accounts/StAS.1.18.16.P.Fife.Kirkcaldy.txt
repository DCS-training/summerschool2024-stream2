and gratuitous service done by it, erected de novo into a free
royal burgh and free port, and new and larger immunities
granted it.  Among its privileges were enumerated, the
Powers expressly given to the baillies, counsellors and com-
munity, of electing and constituting annual magistrates for
the administration of justice and the government of the burgh;
of uplifting customs and applying them to the public good;
of holding courts; of seizing and incarcerating, and punishing
delinquents; with which were conjoined various other privi-

conceived in the barbarous spirit of the times; such as
herezelds, bludewits, merchetae mulierum, fork, foss, sok,
sak, thoill, thame, wraick, vert, weth, wair, venyson, in-
fangtheif, outsangtheif, pit and gallows, etc.*.

sermling, or first erected unto a royal burgh, it may be
warrantably supposed, that before either of these events could
happen, the place must have attained to some importance.
