longed to the Hamiltons of Eliestoun, and having passed through
several families along with the estate, was sold in 1724 by Mr Da-
niel Campbell of Shawfield, for the perpetual retention of eight
bolls of teind meal, payable from his lands within the royalty. "The
magistrates and council, the heritors residing within the burgh, and
thirteen pund land thereof, the members of the kirk-session, and the
proprietors and tenants of the lands of Shawfield have jointly the
right of presentation."
	Stipend.--In 1586, the stipend Of Rutherglen was only 60 merks.
In 1648, 4 chalders 6 bolls of victual, and 250 merks. In 1665, 6
chalders and 200 merks. In 1668, 6 chalders 200 merks, and 50
merks for communion elements. At this period the following articles
were given in charge to the minister, viz. communion cups, tables,
table-cloths, bason, stoup, and kirk Bible. In 1775, the stipend
amounted to L. 77, 10s. In 1793, including allowance for com-
munion elements, 147 bolls 14 3/4 pecks of victual, of which 55 bolls
oats, 34 bolls barley, and the remainder oatmeal. In 1805, the
stipend amounted to L. 203, 15s. 5d. In 1831, 3 498/1000 chalders of
oats, 4 754/1000 of meal, 4 254/1000 bear or barley, and L. 40, including
communion elements.
	On 24th of February 1836, the Court of Teinds augmented the
stipend to as many imperial bushels of victual as are equal to eight-
een chalders, * Linlithgow standard, half meal and half barley,
convertible into money at the highest fiar price of the county,
with L. 10 for communion elements, exclusive of manse and glebe.
	This stipend, which is considerably above the average in the
country, is very difficult to collect, it being paid by no less than
151 heritors in the burgh and landward part of the parish; eighty-
seven of the above number pay under 5s.; some as low as 2d.; twenty

in 1700. The laird of Eliestown, patron.--7. Alexander Muir, ordained 17th De-
cember 1701.--8. Alexander Maxwell, ordained 22d September 1719.--9. William
Maxwell, his brother, admitted 19th August 1742.--10. James Furlong, from Albion
Street Chapel of Ease, Glasgow, admitted on 17th August 1780--11 John Dick,
from Chryston Chapel of Ease, parish of Cadder, admitted on 11th December 1810.
He died on 29th November 1826.--12. Peter Brown, the present incumbent, was
ordained on 25th September 1834.

<FOOTNOTE>As reference in this account of the parish is frequently made to chalders, and
as it is enacted, that, from and after the 1st January 1895, the fiar prices of all grain in
every county in Scotland, for ascertaining the value of minister's stipends, teinds, &c.
shall be struck by the imperial quarter, it may be useful here to state the difference
between the old and the new measures. A Linlithgow firlot for the sale of oats,
barley, bear, and malt, is equal to 1.456231.. that is, one bushel and .456231 decimal
parts; therefore 5.49363...firlots are equal to one imperial quarter. An imperial
quarter, therefore, contains 1 boll, 1 firlot, 1 peck, 3 lippies, and about 8/10 the of a
lippie. A more particular account of the old and new measures may be seen in the
article Glasgow, in this work.
