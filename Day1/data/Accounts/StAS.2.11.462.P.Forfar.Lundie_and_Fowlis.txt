                           II-CIVIL HISTORY.
	Previous to 1377 Fowlis was in possession of the Mortimer fa-
mily. At that time this barony passed into the family of Gray,
in consequence (as appears from a charter of this date) of the
marriage of Sir Andrew Gray of Broxmouth with Janet, daughter
of Sir Roger Mortimer. From the Grays it came by sale into the
possession of the Murrays of Ochtertyre, where it remains, and the
present Sir William Keith Murray is sole proprietor. The burial-
place of the Noble family of Gray, however, is still in the east
end of the church, and the part that is appropriated to this pur-
pose has lately been fitted up in the most gorgeous style of Go-
thic architecture. The writer of this notice has no means of as-
certaining the exact time of this being first used as the burial-place
of the Grays, nor the individual members of this family that lie
there.
        Parochial Registers.-Respecting the parochial registers of
Lundie and Fowlis, it may suffice to state, that they began at a
very early period, 1667, and are kept together till 1701; but dur-
ing this period many blanks occur, and for some of them apologies
are inserted at the time. Since 1701, each district of the parish
has had its own register, and they are pretty correct. About
eight years ago a register of deaths was added to those prdvhously
in use; but a perfectly accurate set of registers will never be had
till there be a compulsory enactment, as there are still many pa-
rent's who are backward in intimating the births of the children.
	We shall now notice the two districts of the parish jointly,

                        III.-POPULATION.
	The population of the united parish, though wholly agricultu-
ral, has fluctuated considerably, both in its amount, and in the re-
lative proportions of the districts.
