   Wild Animals.-The wild animals of this parish are not
now numerous.  The fox sometimes infests the sheep pa-
stures.  Hares are plentiful.  Those little mischievous qua-
drupeds, which prey upon poultry, have not yet been whol-

animals perished by cold and hunger, and many, in the ex-

easy prey to whoever chose to pursue them.  One gentle-
man had a number of hares taken alive, which he con-
fined in an apartment, and fed plentifully with corn till the
snow began to disappear, then generously set them at
liberty.
