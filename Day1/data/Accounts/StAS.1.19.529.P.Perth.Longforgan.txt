autumn; after oats or wheat, and again in the spring; they
may then be planted in drills, either with dung or without
it, according to the state of the field, or the crop which is to
follow.  If they be planted after dunged wheat, and to be
followed with barley, dung is unnecessary.  If after oats, as
a cleaning crop, and to be followed by wheat, it is a good
practice to dung them well.  This ensures a great crop of
yams; prevents carting upon and poaching the ground as
much as possible; and if the field be in proper order, may
be followed by wheat, without any more dung.  However,
this is not recommended as the best preparation for wheat.

   Drills.-In planting yams, the drills may be drawn from
4 1/2 to 2 1/2 feet distant, according to the judgment of the far-
mer.  If the ground be very rich, and if the principal ob-
ject be to clean it properly for a crop of wheat to follow,
and, if well dunged, a very great crop may be expected at
4 1/2 feet distant, and there will be ample room to work it as
perfectly as if it was fallow.  The stems will cover the
whole completely, and with ease.  Every extraneous plant
may be destroyed.  The sets should be large, about 1-4th of a
large yam, dropped at about one foot or nine inches asunder.
Small sets do not answer so well.

   A great Crop.-In 1974, upon the Mains of Castle Hunt-
ly, a field of yams was dressed in this manner, and yielded
110 bolls per Scotch acre, which weighed, when cleaned of
earth, 5 stone 5 pounds Dutch per firlot, or 23 stone Eng-
lish per boll, at 16 pounds each stone, or 40,480 pounds per
acre.  It was well dunged to the yams; and the wheat
crop that followed looked remarkably well, August 1795,
but did not turn out so well as was expected.  This, how-
ever, is no rule, as the wheat crop in general, and particu-
larly through the Carse, was light that year.  A scotch
