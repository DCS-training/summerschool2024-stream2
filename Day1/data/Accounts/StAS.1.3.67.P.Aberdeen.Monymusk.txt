   Soil.-The soil is in general good, and is distinguished into
infield and outfield, the proportion of which is as two of the
latter to one of the former; excepting in the farms which
lie on the banks of the river, which almost all conflict of
infield and well cultivated lands.  The mould is generally of
a blackish colour, rather light, having little or no mixture
of clay in it.  The haugh grounds have a small mixture of
land, which gives them a lighter colour than the soil more
distant from the river.  There is a large quantity of rich
clay in most of the lands that go by the name of outfield
ground, and such of them as have been limed, and properly
cultivated, become as rich as the best infield ground in the
parish.  

   Air.-There is nothing very particular in the air of this
parish, to distinguish it in that respect from the circumjacent
country.  A transient observer might perhaps pronounce the
situation rather unfavourable to health.  A large proportion of
the lands lying low, and on the banks of the river, are of
course visited with frequent fogs; and the extensive plantations
which cover a considerable part of the grounds, and nearly
surround the whole parish, might be supposed to prevent the
free current of the winds, and detain the stagnated air so
long as to affect the health of the people; but these seeming
disadvantages are more than counterbalanced, by the country
being open on the east and south west, which affords a free
circulation of air; and the frequent west, and north-west
winds following the course of the river, which, in the upper
part of the parish, runs along a deep glen bounded by high
hills, sweep away whatever noxious vapours might have
been collecting for a few days in the flat parts of the coun-
try.  The air in fact is esteemed good, and many persons in
consumptive disorders take their residence here, for the be-
