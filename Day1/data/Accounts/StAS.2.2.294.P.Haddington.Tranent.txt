                      III-POPULATION.
   Until the middle of last century, the greater part of the popu-
lation of this parish, consisting of colliers and salters, were little
better than slaves, being bound to their works for life, and after
having engaged in them after the years of puberty, were not per-
mitted to leave their employment, unless the trade was given up.
This cruel practice was happily done away in 1775, but the evil
effects of it were not so easily overcome. A class thus nurtured in
bondage, enjoying little intercourse with others, and their religious
instruction not much attended to, could hardly have been expected
to keep pace with the civilization of the country. The vice of
drunkenness spread its pernicious influence very widely among them,
and though families frequently make about L. 2 per week, they
rarely lay by any of their wages, and have not their dwelling-
houses so comfortably furnished as the farm-servants and labourers,
who do not earn half the amount.
