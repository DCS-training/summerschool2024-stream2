  Language.-The language of the common people is Gaelic,
but almost all the young, and most of the old inhabitants, under-
stand English. The Gaelic is evidently losing ground.
  Character and Habits of the People.-The people for the most
part are decent, orderly, and industrious in their habits ; the
greater part of them apply themselves to husbandry, or to a sea-
faring life. Their ordinary food consists chiefly of potatoes and
fish, oatmeal and milk. Poaching in game or salmon is very
rare, and the degrading and demoralizing practice of smuggling
is totally unknown among them.
