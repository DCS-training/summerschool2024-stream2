   Orchards.-There are 4 orchards in the parish.  The
early blow is often blasted by easterly winds*.  The later
kinds thrive best.  The crop of apples and pears are seldom
plentiful.

   Air.-The air, which is dry and healthy, is not produc-
tive of local distempers.  There are a number of old peo-
ple, but no instances of remarkable longevity.

   Diseases.-The most frequent disorders are vernal and
autumnal fevers, which, her, as well as elsewhere, have
changed their nature, and become nervous and lingering.
Though they be visibly infectious, an ill-judged sympathy
brings many young people into danger, who, while they
cannot profit the sick by their personal attendance, do a pre-
judice to themselves and others, by carrying home the in-
section.  The natural small-pox are less fatal, since they
have been less an object of solicitous care.  Fresh air and
cool regimen have saved the lives of many.  Inoculation is
not yet general, nor is it much relised, among the lower
tanks.

   Climate.-The climate is not inferior to that of Lothian.
By the shelter of a wall it ripens apricots and peaches in
the open air.  Stone-fruit of every kind thrives better than
in richer soils; apples and pears not so well.

dispensed with.  The weedings are a good succedaneum for peat-mofs,
which is scarce, by affording a comfortable firing, from 4 d to 6 d. per
load; and trees will in time generate both soil and mofs where there was
none, and make way for the plough at length, in places where it might
have long laboured in vain.
*They should follow the plan here, adopted in Denmark, of covering
the trees, in the spring, during the day, and uncovering them at night;
which keeps the blossom back, till the season becomes genial.
