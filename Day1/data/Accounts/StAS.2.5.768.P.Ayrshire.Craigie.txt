	Education.--There are two schools in the parish, the parochial
school, and one in the south-west end of the parish, at Under-
hills, near Barnweill, and no additional schools are required, as
the east end of this parish has the advantage of schools in the vi-
cinity, one in the parish of Galston, and another in the parish of
Mauchline. The school-room at Underliills is given free of rent
by the proprietor, and the teacher is supported by the scbool-fees.
	The parochial school-house was built in 1807. The school-
master's salary is the maximum; and the average amount of school-
fees per annum for ten years is about L. 20 Sterling, making the
schoolmaster's income about L. 54 per annum, exclusive of house
and garden.
	Friendly Societies.--There are two Friendly Societies for males
only, and their expenditure yearly is from L.60 to L.70.
	Poor.--The average number of persons receiving parochial aid
is 12, who are paid monthly from the poor's funds. A few others
receive aid occasionally. The average sum paid to each of these
twelve is L. 4, 2s. 5d. per annum. Three of these have about
L. 6 each ; the rest have considerably less than the average. The
annual average amount of contributions for relief of the poor for
the last nine years is L. 51, 19s. Id., viz.
