                        V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
     Means of Communications.--The nearest post-office is at Mei-
gle.  There is, however, a sub-office at Alyth, which is the near-
est market-town, and about eight miles from the church of
Glenisla.  Two lines ofroad are kept inrepair by the Statute
Labour Assesment,--the one leading to Alyth, the other
communicating with Kirriemuir and Castletown of Braemar
by the Spittal of Glenshee.  The former of these isabout eight
and a half miles in lenght, the latter six.  The other roads are,
for the most part, imperfectly formed, and proved very indifferent
means of communication.  The bridges are four in number, of
which two are ofstone, oneof iron, andone of wood.  The two
latter are intended chiefly forfoot-passengers.
     Ecclesiastical State.--The church is centrically situated for the
population; but, from the great lenght of the parish, and its moun-
tainous nature, scarcely more than one-half of the inhabitants are
within fourmiles of it.  It was built in 1821, is in agood stateof
repair, and affords accomodation for 700 persons.  The seats
are alloted to the people according to the valued rent of the pro-
perties on which they reside.  The manse was built in 1813,and
is still in good condition.  The glebe consists ofabout eight acres,
Fifteen acresofmoorlandwere lately addedto it, by the division
of a neighbouring common, three acres and three-quarters of which
have sincebeen improved.  The whole would let for L.16.  The
amount ofstipend is L.150, with L.8, 6s. for communion ele-
ments.
