   Ferries, etc.-There are two stated ferries from this to
the neighbouring parishes, viz. one to the Mull from Fere-
nish, and one to Ardnamurchan from Dorlin, at the mouth
of Loch-Suineart.  Another such is much wanted in the E.
end of the parish, either at Kyle or Knock, where, though
the boatmen ferry at times, one cannot force them out but
when it suits their humour and conveniency, and even then
at whatever rates they please to exact.  It is much to be
wished, that in these, and such stated ferries, some more at-
tention was paid by these who have the management of the
police, both to the conduct of the ferrymen, and the kind of
boats they ought to keep.-Over and above the boats used
on there ferries, there are no fewer than 100 small boats in
the parish kept for the purpose of fishing, and carrying sea-
ware as manure to their lands, etc.; as also 12 or 14 barges
of a larger size, well rigged, the property of the gentlemen
tacksmen, for transporting themselves occasionally to the
neighbouring islands, and for other purposes of usefulness and
convenience.  There are likewise boats of greater tonnage
for following the herring fishery at a distance; and one vessel
of about 20 tons burden, employed in the coasting trade.-

deer and roes; and in our hills, mountain-hares: The whole
parish, both hill and strath, is much infested with moles, and no
means are used to destroy them, though they are very hurtful
to the ground.-It has been remarked of old, that rats would
not live in Morven; this remark seems to be confirmed by seve-
ral circumstances consistent with the knowledge of most of the
inhabitants now alive.  A few years ago, some vessels were put
ashore by stress of weather in Loch-alin Bay; by which cir-
cumstance, a vast number of rats flocked to the houses on each
side of the harbour.  So numerous and mischievous were they,
that it was apprehended they would spread and overrun the
whole parish; yet it happened, that, in a few years, they disap-
peared, and now none are to be seen from one end of the pa-
rish to the other.
