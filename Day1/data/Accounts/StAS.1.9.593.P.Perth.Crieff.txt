boll.  In 1763, a merchant of Crieff erected a paper-mill
being the first of the kind, except one, on the north side of
the Forth; an oil-mill in 1775; and in 1785, formed an
extensive bleachfield with suitable machinery.   And so
late as 1792, some other manufacturers of this town erect-
ed 2 mills for carding and spinning cotton, and a third oil-
mill.  These, indeed, for the convenience of ground and
water, were built on the oppsite sides of the rivers Earn
and Torot, in the parishes of Muthil and Monivaird; yet
are here mentioned, as they belong to inhabitants of this
parish, a considerable nummber of whose children as well as
adults they daily employ.  A tambouing manufacture
commenced here in 1792, which presently employs 30
girls from 8 to 12 years of age.  Those above 10 are en-
gaged four years, and those under to five:  and receive of
wages, L. 3, 10 s. for the first; L. 4, 0 s. the second; L. 5,
10 s. the third; L.6, 10 s. the fourth; and L. 8 for the fifth
year.  There are here two distilleries; one consumes 500,
the other 250 bolls of bear annually.  And one brewery,
begun in 1791, which in 1792 made 9600 gallons of beer
at 14 d. and 22 d. the gallon from 400 bolts of bear at 15 s.
the boll.  There was a tannery built in 1782, and a
second in 1789.  They are both now in the hands of one
company, and are supposed in 1792 to have tanned 3100
hides of different sizes, which, when fully manufactured,
may bring above L.3000.  Of these hides 981 were bought
raw in Crieff for L.375, the cow-hides at 6 s. 9 d. the calf
at 7 s. and 2 d. the stone.  Till within these few years, the
weavers chiefly worked in linen, worsted stuffs, druggets,
and coarse woolen cloths for the country use.  Besides
these, they are now much employed in working a thin
kind of coarse linen called Silefias, vulgarly Scrims,
whereof each piece is 27 or 30 inches broad, and 92
