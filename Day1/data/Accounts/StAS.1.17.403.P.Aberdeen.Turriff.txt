present proprietor.  The estate of Gask, which belonged of old
to the Forbeses, and more lately to the Fordyces, was sold by
the daughters of John Fordyce of Gask to James Mackie in
1769; who sold it to George Robinson now of Gask, writer
to the signet, the present proprietor, in 1781.  This estate
has been an independent barony of itself for several centuries.
It appears upon record, that in 1375, it belonged to the Tu-
rins of Foveran, who flourished in Aberdeenshire, in the days
of King Robert Bruce.  Afterwards it came into the family
of Burnet of Leys.  Thomas Burner of Gask was killed at the
battle of Flowden; and King James V. renewed the gift of the
lands to his son William, then, and on that account, declared a
9 L. land of old extent; on whose retour, A. D. 1514, does the
present proprietor of Gask hold his freehold at this day.  On
this place is lately built a modern house, in a pleasant si-
tuation, beautified with planting.  Within the last 40 years,
the land rent of the parish is supposed to be doubled, and to
have increased more within that period than for 200 years
before.  This, among other causes, may be ascribed to the
practice of giving an additional yearly rent at the commence-
ment of every new lease, instead of a grassum, which was
the general practice before the middle of this century.
   The valued rent of the parish is 5459 L. 2 s. 10 d. Scots;
and the real rent, valuing meal and grain at 10 s. for each
boll of 8 stone Amsterdam weight, is about 2800 L. Sterling.
   Services, or work done by the tenant to the heritor in
harvest, and on various other occasions, not improperly called
bondages, also the payment of sheep, poultry etc. called
customs, still constitute a great proportion of the rent
of some estates.  The commutation of these into money,
which has already taken place in the estates of Fintray and
Torvie, it is hoped will be soon universally adopted.  Exac-
