the parish, are brought back to be interred with their ances-
tors, these circumstances are perhaps sufficient to account for
this unfavourable balance.

   Poor, Ecclesiastical State, and Schools.-There are 20 persons,
at a medium, who receive a monthly supply from the kirk-
session; they draw from 2 s. to 2 s. 6 d. each; but, as the
annual contributions, dues, and fines included, seldom exceed
34 L. there has been a necessity, upon two different occasions,
of supplying the deficiency by an assessment.
   The church, which was built in 1727, has an agree-
able air of neatness and propriety; and the manse having
undergone a late repair, is at present in very good condition.
The stipend, as augmented in 1789, consists of 8 bolls of
wheat, 24 bolls of barley, 24 bolls of oats, and 60 L. in mo-

manse, contains 6 acres of excellent ground.
   The school was carried, many years ago, from this village
to another, which, though nearer to the center of the parish,
is found inconvenient, on account of its remoteness from
the most populous and frequented quarters.  It is attended
by about 45 scholars, whose wages, if well paid, would
amount to 10 L.  The schoolmaster's salary, and his emolu-
ments as session-clerk, may bring 12 L. or 14 L. more; a pro-
vision, it must be granted, inadequate to the support of a man
of merit in an important profession.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The farmers of this parish,
though reduced in point of numbers, have improved, on the
other hands in-their consequence and character; and their
mode, both of thinking and living, is much more liberal than
that of their-predecessors.  The lower orders, when, their
manners are considered, are likewise entitled to a favourable
