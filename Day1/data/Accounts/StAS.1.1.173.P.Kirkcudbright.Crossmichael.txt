   Of those who have died in the course of these seven years,
12 were under 4 years of age; 9 from 60 to 70; 16 from
70 to 85; and 23 of various ages.  The annual births have
been to the whole population as 1 to 36; the marriages as
1 to 192; the deaths as 1 to 98.  This last circumstance af-
fords a striking proof of the uncommon healthiness of the
place.

   Causes which have affected the State of Population.-Formerly
there were a considerable number of lot-crofts, that is, small
pieces of land kept always in crop, and let along with cotta-
ges, and the privilege of grass for one or two cows.  The
abolition of these about 20 or 30 years ago, and the practice
of throwing several farms into one, occupied chiefly for the
purpose of grazing, gave a temporary check to population.
A very large tract of the finest land in this parish was for a
number of years in the possession of one man, who neither 
resided upon, nor ploughed it.  Of late, marle and lime
have contributed greatly to the improvement of the country;
and, as agriculture requires more hands than pasturage, po-
pulation has been increasing with rapidity.  The farms have
been reduced to a smaller size; and only three are occupied
by tenants who do not reside upon them.  In a few years a
considerable number will probably be added to the people,
by the execution of a plan adopted, on part of their estates,
by three gentlemen, to whom a large portion of the parish
belongs.  The plan is this: As soon as a lease expires (and
several hundred acres now are, or have lately been in the na-
tural possession of the proprietors) the farm is parcelled out
into small lots, from 4 to 15 acres each of arable ground.
These, properly fenced, are let to those who offer the high-
est rent: The tenants sue house-steads and gardens, for which
they pay a duty, at the rate of L. 2 or L. 4 per acre annually,
