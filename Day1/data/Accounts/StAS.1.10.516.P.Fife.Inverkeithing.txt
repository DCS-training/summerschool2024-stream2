     Statistical Account

   In this town, there is a tan-work.  The situation is con-
venient for carrying on that business.  The raw hides can
be got in great quantities, this being the market where the
adjacent parts of the country and the shipping, both in this
and the neighbouring ports, are supplied with provisions.
The present work is but small; the leather made is said to
be of an ordinary quality, and meets with a ready sale.
