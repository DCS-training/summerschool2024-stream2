mentioned in the deed of mortification, for the relief of
such persons, living in the town and parish of Aberdeen
only, who are unable to sustain themselves, and who are
bedrids, or afflicted with bodily diseases, that are supposed

lingering diseases; and failing such, for any other indigent

town and parish of Aberdeen.
   Anno 1782, November 2d, a subscription was opened
for obtaining a supply of grain to the poor of Old and New
Aberdeen, and, in a few weeks, to the great praise of the
inhabitants, as well as relief of the poor, the subscription
amounted to no less than L. 1782, 13 s. Sterling.  Two
gentlemen were sent to England to purchase grain: A com-
mittee was appointed, and met once a week, for attending
to and relieving the distress of the poor while it continued:
To encourage importing meal, pease, flour, potatoes, boun-
ties were granted; the ordinary custom on meal was dis-
pensed with, and the price of the meal lowered from time
to time, and given out in proportion to the numbers and
necessities of the poor families.
   Anno 1787, three fishermen were drowned in attempting
to enter the harbour of the Cove.  A subscription was
opened for their widows and children, which amounted to
L. 36: 17: 9 Sterling.
   Anno 1790, May 17th, a boat belonging to the Cove, in
the parish of Nigg, and neighbourhood of this city, was lost.
Five of the men in the boat were married, and left widows
and 25 children; the sixth man was unmarried, but left an
aged mother, who, in a great measure, depended upon him
for subsistence.  The Collodions and subscriptions made for
them in Aberdeen amounted to L 103:4:3 Sterling.
