     NUMBER XXVIII.

     PARISH OF WIGTON.

     (COUNTY AND PRESBYTERY OF WIGTON, SYNOD OF
     GALLOWAY.)

     By the Rev. Mr. ANDREW DUNCAN.

     Name.

   THE parish of Wigton, by a natural and obvious idea,
is denominated from the town, the place where the
church was originally erected, and which contains the most
of the parishioners.  The name of the town itself is ap-
parently Saxon, and seems to have arisen among that peo-
ple, by whom Wigton was probably founded, in the 7th
or 8th century, when they were masters of this part of
the country.  The name seems to have been taken from
the local situation; though the precise signification and
etymology of the word is rather uncertain.  It is probably
compounded of the two Saxon words, wie, a village, and
ton, a hill; thus signifying, a town seated on an eminence,
as Wigton strikingly is.  Or, perhaps, it may be derived
from vik, a corner, and ton, a hill, in the same language;
