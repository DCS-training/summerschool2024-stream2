   Antiquities.-  In the parish of Greenock, unless a person
were to hazard a conjecture about some inches of stones,
which occur in the most defart parts of it, there are no an-
tiquities.  Half way between the towns of Greenock and
Port-Glasgow*, is Capellow, where, (according to tradition,
favoured by the name of the place, and several ruinous
yares, as they are termed,) some Dutch fishers, long ago re-
sided.  About a quarter of a mile south-west of Capellow,
may be seen the remains of the old castle of Greenock, in
demolishing which, time, as is too common in like cases
throughout Scotland, has got very great assistance+.

   Heritors, Stipend, and Rent.-Of the greatest part of the
parish, Shaw Stuart, Esq; of Greenock, patron of the kirk,
is proprietor.  The other heritors are Crawfurd of Cartburn,
and Hamilton of Garvock.  The stipend of the minister
exclusive of the glebe and manse lately built, is between
L. 90 and L. 100.  The present incumbent is the ninth
minister of this parish since the Reformation.

   The real rent of the two parishes of Greenock, it would
not be easy to ascertain.  In the town, and at some distance
from the quays, ground has been sold at the rate of L. 58
Sterling per fall.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Along the public road between the two towns, there is most con-
venient foot path.

+On a considerable eminence, south of the town and close upon it,
stands the present mansion-house of Greenock.  A great part of it is mo-
dern, no part of it very old.  It is a large house.  Its policy, (as they call
it,) or pleasure ground, has been extensive, but has fallen into decay.
