     Statistical Account

or langemark day, from the Saxon langemark.  It is evident-
ly of Saxon origin, and probably established here in the reign
of, or sometime posterior to Malcom I.
   The manners of the inhabitants, as to diet and drink, are
considerably changed within there 20 years, which may be
exemplified from the public entertainments of the magis-
trates.  Formerly their debauch was a moderate meal, with
a few bottles of ale or porter, and a dram or two; and, in
gala days, a little punch.  Now, they have superb enter-
tainments, with punch, port, and even claret.  The com-
mon fuel of the parish is coal.  The statute labour is com-
muted.  All animals, common to the south of Scotland, are to
be found here.  Rabbets, however, are now entirely rooted
out: pheasants, supposed from Hamilton house, have some-
times been shot in the parish.
   There are few pigeon houses in the parish.  Crows are nume-
rous, and do a great deal of mischief; as do also hares, par-
ticularly to the fruit trees.  The laws, made for the preservation
of game, were certainly never meant to prevent proprietors or
tenants from defending their property against such depreda-
tors; and little scruple need be made of destroying any one
of those animals, when hurting the property of individuals,
though it certainly would be a violation of the law, to do it
for the sake of game alone.
   Advantages and Disadvantages.  Perhaps no single parish
in Scotland affords more eligible situations for mills of all
kinds than this parish.  Sir Richard Arkwright, when here
in 1824, was astonished at the advantages derivable from
the falls of Clyde, and exultingly said, that Lanark would
probably in time become the Manchester of Scotland; as no
place he had ever seen afforded better situations, or more
ample streams of water for cotton machinary.
