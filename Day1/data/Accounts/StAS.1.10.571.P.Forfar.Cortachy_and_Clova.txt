   Agriculture.-Almost the only cultivated part of these uni-
ted parishes, except what lies on the southern extremity, is
that lying along the banks of the Esk, about 14 miles, long
and half mile broad.  The rest is hilly, or laid out for pas-
ture.  Considerable improvement of late has been made in
agriculture, particularly in the lower part of the parish of
Cortachy.  Here the farmer observes a proper rotation in
cropping; and the fields, after 3 years tillage, are sown out
with grass seeds for 4 years.  In the middle and upper dis-
tricts of these united parishes, where sheep and cattle are the
staple commodity, improvement in agriculture is not so much
attended to; nor is the climate so favourable for raising corn
as in the lower parts.  If here the farmer can raise as much
grain as will suffice for meal and seed, he seldom seeks far-
ther, and trusts to his profits from sheep and cattle to pay
his rents.  The only manure on the parish is that which is
made by the cattle on the farms.  Some farmers, for the
sake of improvement, drive marl from the loch of Kinordy,
in the parish of Kirriemuir, which is about three miles dis-
tant from the southern boundary of the parish of Cortachy.
Such of the farmers in the parish as can procure marl, are
enabled to bring their farms into state of high cultivation,
and to raise excellent crops; but this species of manure can
only be acquired by a few of them, by reason of their great
distance from it.
   The English plough has lately been introduced here; but
that chiefly used is the Scotch plough.  The harrow and
cart used are of the common construction; the latter general-
ly drawn by two horses.  A good plough costs from 40 s. to
50 s.; a cart from 6 L. to 7 L.; and a harrow about 10 s.*
