   the Gaelic Grianeg, signifying, according to Gaelic etymo-
logists, the Sunny Bay, or, the Bay of the Sun.-  This parish
is situated in the N. W. part of the county of Renfrew,
within the bounds of the presbytery of Paisley, and Synod
of Glasgow and Ayr, having the magnificent, and pictu-
resque firth of Clyde on the north.  Indented by several
convenient bays, the chief of which is the united bay of
Greenock, and Crewsurdsdike, it stretches along the frith
about 4 1/4 Endlish miles;  to the fouth it extend, considerably
farther, represnting altogether the shape of a capital D,
of which the curvature has been too far protracted.

   Hills, Surface, Fuel, etc.-  Excepting a strip of  level
ground of different breadths, along the shore, the parish
of Greenock is hilly.  To a spectator from Garval, a point
of land on the east side of the bay above mentioned, a
range of hills appear rising at Finlayston, the seat of the
Earls of Glencairn, opposite to the Rock of Dumbarton,
Louch, and Port-Glasgow;  thence they recede southward,
heightening as they recede, till, at the distance of about 2
miles S. E. from the town of Greenock*, having attained
the height of almost 800 feet above the level of the sea,
they again decline, bending to the bay Gourock, where
they terminate;  thus forming to the eye a sweep of a large
circle, including, with the frith, a great extent of surface,
very agreeably diversified, except by wood, which is scarce.
Beyond the hills seen from the shore, there are others at
different distances, some 100 feet higher, and one at least
200, with here and there intervening swamps and mosses,
affording the country people abundance of peat for fuel to
themselves, and for sale in the neighbouring towns and vil-
lages.  From the farthest hills, the ground declines to the
