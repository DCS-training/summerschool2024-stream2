ever, all the buildings connected with the farms have assumed a
more commodious and substantial form.  At that period, not a
thrashing-mill existed; now, there are upwards of thirty, and every
year sees them augmented.
   Produce.-The following may be regarded as an approximation
to the truth in respect to the quantity and value of farm produce
raised in the parish: Number of arable acres 3360 imperial.  Of
these there may be in oats 960 acres; in barley 480 do.; in hay,
480 do.; in grass, 960 do.; in turnips and potatoes, 480 do.
Oats, 960 acres at 24 bushels per acre, 23040 bushels; barley,

   Manufactures.-The only manufacture which may be said to
exist in the parish, is that of coarse woollen stockings by females.
In this manufacture, a good part of the wool clipped from the fleecy
inhabitants is consumed.  It is customary for those so employed
to purchase the annual stock of wool likely to be required by them
during the summer season, which, having been carded by the mills
in the neighbourhood, is then spun into worsted, and knitted into
stockings chiefly during winter.  Though the profits in this ma-
nufacture be extremely small, yet it affords occupation to a great
many females who would otherwise be idle, and furnishes a ready
employment for fragments of time.  A very expert female will spin
and knit a pair of stockings in two days.  For these she receives
generally from 1s. to 1s. 3d. when brought to market; of which
sum, however, not more than one-half is the remuneration for her
labour, the other half being the price of wool, carding, and spin-
ning.  One individual will manufacture about three stones and a half
of wool in a year, out of which she will produce from 120 to 130
pairs of stockings.  Few of the females so employed are entirely
dependent on this work for their subsistence, the profits of it be-
ing scarcely sufficient for this purpose.  Many of them are partly
employed in out-door labour, where they can earn higher wages.
In times, however, when such is not to be had, or when the season
does not admit of it, or when age and infirmities have debarred
them from it, the stockings are the, never-failing resource.  And
so much is this the habitual employment of the females, especially
