     of Crossmichael.

   Character of the People.-In their religious sentiments, the
inhabitants of Galloway are apparently more united than
those of most other parts of Scotland.  Within the bounds
of the extensive presbytery of Kirkcudbright, there is not a
dissenting meeting-house of any description.  The morals of
the people in this country have, from three causes, sustained
material injury.  Its vicinity to Ireland has rendered it the
receptacle of some of the least respectable of the inhabitants
of the kingdom.  The cattle trade is less favourable than
agriculture to sobriety and honesty: But, above all, smug-
gling, for which our local situation is but too favourable, tends
to relax every moral obligation.  But, while these general re-
marks are made, it is by no means admitted that the conduct
of the inhabitants of this parish furnishes any extraordinary
evidence of their truth.  None have occasion to beg without
the bounds of the parish.  Vagrants never repeat without
effect a real or a fictitious tale of woe; and when extraordi-
nary collections are made for any charitable purpose, this pa-
rish yields not to any of its neighbours in point of liberality.
The stile of manners are such as may be expected to charac-
terise a people in a state between rudeness and refinement,
possessed of a competent portion of the comforts of life, with-
out having obtained the means of luxury.

   Church, etc.-The manse was built in 1744, and the
church 1751.  Both have been repaired and enlarged since
the ordination of the present incumbent.  Ten acres have
been added to 5 1/2, of which the glebe formerly consisted.  By
decreet 1784, the stipends are, 42 bolls victual, and L. 762:16:10
Scots money.  The value of the whole living, on an average,
may be L. 112 Sterling.  Alexander Gordon of Culvennan,
Esq; is patron.  Mr John Johnstone, a batchellor, is the pre-
sent incumbent.
