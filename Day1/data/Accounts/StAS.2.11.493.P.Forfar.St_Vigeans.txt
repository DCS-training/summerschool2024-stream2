results. The temperature was taken also at eight o'clock A. M.,
and it differed only from the medium of maximum and minimum,
on one years average, about one-tenth of a degree, and, on, ano-
ther, three-tenths; so that this district differs much in its daily
curve of temperature from Leith Fort, as ascertained by Sir David
Brewster.
   Average of the daily medium temperature between the maxi-
mum and minimum, by Six's register thermometer, two miles from
the sea, height above its level, 60 feet, and above the surface, 4

   It maybe remarked, however, that these four years have been
everywhere of lower temperature than usual.
   In the parish, there are only two springs of very equable tem-
perature, varying only about half a degree throughout the whole
year. These give the average temperature, 47.4. One of these
is at the inmost corner of the mason's cave, on the level of the
sea, and about 90 feet below the surface of the ground, the other
about 100 feet above the sea level, on the side of the road leading
to Montrose, about a mile east from Arbroath, which latter throws
up large quantities of carbonic acid gas, and atmospheric air. An-
other copious spring near the manse, which varies about 4&deg;, accord-
ing to the season, gives the average temperature for 1841, 47.2&deg;.
The Brothock stream, which originally appears to have been a
chain of small lakes, is mostly fed by springs, and therefore not so
speedily frozen as streams usually are of a similar size. It con-
tains no fish, but some small pike and eels, the bleaching-works
on its banks having completely banished the trout formerly found
in it.
   The key to the geognosy of this district appears to lie at
and near the Red-head. For the section of the rock there con-
