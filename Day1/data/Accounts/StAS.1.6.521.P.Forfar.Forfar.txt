few years will see to an end:  at any rate the peats got from
thence, though a convenient, are by no means a cheap article
of fuel; for the poor man, could be afford the money all at once,
would be much cheaper, and if cheaper he must be more com-
fortable, with coal.  A considerable quantity of thriving firs
are rising on the town's property, and on some of the estates
in the neighbourhood; but their number seems by no means
adequate to the probable demand for firing, when the mosses
shall be exhausted; so that the community's sole dependence
for this article, at some future period, will be on coal,
which at present is obtained from Arbroath and Dundee, at a
very great expence, not less than from 9 s. to 10 s. 6 d. per boll
of 70 stone Dutch.  In some places of the slate quarries in
this neighbourhood, strata of culin-stone have been found,
such as indicate the vicinity of coal, and they excited no little
expectation some years that this useful fossil might be disco-
vered here.  Some seeble attempts towards a discovery were
made by the proprietor of one of these quarries, and a few a-
cres around it; but his finances were unequal to the expence,
and he met with no support from the public.
   There are few places within the royalty, in which a quarry
of some kind may not easily be found, so that both stone and slate
are comparatively cheap; but the expence of lime and wood,
neither of which can be had but from the sea port towns or
an equal distance, will probably continue, with the high price
of fuel, to obstruct in some measure the growing prosperity of
this burgh, till wealth and the spirit of enterprize shall open
a communication by water between it and the sea.
   In spite of  these disadvanges, however, Forfar is, and is
likely to continue, a thriving place; situated in the centre of a
well cultivated country, the seat of the court of justice, the
members of which at a moderate computation bring L. 1500
