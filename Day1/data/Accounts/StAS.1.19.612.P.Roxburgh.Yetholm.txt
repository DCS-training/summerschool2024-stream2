     Statistical Account

Upon taking a new survey of the number of inhabitants,
reckoning none but those who reside at present (January
1797) in the parish, I found in Town-Yetholm 490 souls,
in Kirk-Yetholm 305, and in the rest of the parish 181;
in all 976.  The population in 1755, by the return sent to
Dr Webster, was 699.
   The reason why the number of females exceeds that of
the males must be, that for about 30 or 40 years past the
country about being greatly depopulated, single women un-
fit for farmers service, or an old widow with a daughter or
two, most of them equally unfit, took refuge in these villa-
ges, and earned their livelihood by spinning, perhaps some
one of the family by hoeing turnips by the day, and hiring
themselves in harvest; whilst the males hired themselves
for herds, hinds, and farmers servants, and were in other
parishes.  This is not mere conjecture, for a great part of
the paupers upon the list consist of such women, and I know
of many more who still subsist by their own labour.  Be-
sides, some single women, or widows, after obtaining a set-
tlement in other parishes, come to reside in these villages;
because stout women, fit to be employed the whole season
in every kind of out-work, are so scarce in proportion to
the demand, that no farmer will let a cottage, but upon the
condition of being furnished with a worker, for whom, even
in the turnip-season, they pay 8 d. or 9 d. per day, without
victuals.  Those who were hired by the day in summer
1795 got 1 s. a-day; and men before harvest got 1 s. and
6 d. a-day, without victuals.  During harvest many farmers
in this parish gave for men 1 s. and 6 d. with victuals, and
none gave below 1 s. and 4 d.  For women 1 s. and 4 d.
and none below 1 s. and 2 d.  Some years ago 6 d. was rec-
koned equal to victuals for a day:  8 d. is now thought by
some the proper allowance.  Labourers prefer getting their
victuals to an allowance in money.
