General Appendix to [Vol. i.

   The correctness of the expression respecting the Moubray
family, in the Statistical Account of Dalmeny, p. 239, ' Sir
'Robert Moubray sold it, (Barnbougle,) whose representa-
'tive, it is said, is still in the parish, but reduced to the con-
'dition of a common servant,' will, however, be sufficiently
apparent from the following statement.  Sir John Moubray
of Barnbougle, the last lineal descendant of that great family,
having only one daughter, and no sons, bestowed, in 1511,
the estate of Cockairney upon his father's brother, William
Moubray; and the descendants of this William of Cock-
airney are consequently the male representatives of the old
family.  But Sir John's daughter and heiress, Barbara Mou-
bray, inherited Barnbougle; her husband Robert Barton,
and their children, assumed the name of Moubray: their
great grandson and lineal descendant, Sir Robert Moubray,
fold Barnbougle, the extensive estate of his ancestors, in 1615;
and the representative of this Sir Robert was the person al-
luded to as reduced to the condition of a common servant.  The
writer of this note cannot here omit expressing his acknow-
ledgements to the Right Honourable the Earl of Roseberry,
the present proprietor of that noble barony, by whose libe-
rality, kindness and attention, he was indulged with the
free perusal of the charters and other writs of Barnbougle,
of which those respecting the Moubray family extend from
1346 to 1615.

   On reading your account of Sorbie, I felt uneasy on see-
ing Lady Galloway's shrubbery walks neglected, and that
much of what was said about the harbour of Garliestown
