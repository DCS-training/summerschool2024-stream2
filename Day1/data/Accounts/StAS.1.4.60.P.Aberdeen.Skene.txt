tend greatly to beautify a country, and prove ultimately
highly useful and profitable.  Ash, plane, pine, common
fir, willow, larix, are the kinds of trees which are princi-
pally produced.  The larix is only of late introduced; and
it seems to thrive better, and advance faster than any other
tree.  It is attended with this singular advantage too, that
it thrives almost in any soil, and in any situation.  Horses,
black cattle, and sheep, are the animals which the parish
produces.  The number of cattle amounts to 1185; of sheep
to 1205; of horses, to 199.  The number of acres may possibly
be, at an average, above 8000:  Of these, about 2300 are cal-
led infield; about 3056 outfield; about 1640 pasture-ground;
534 moss, and about 520 moor-ground.  The greater part
of the arable ground is employed in raising oats and beat.
A middling farm will fow about 36 or 40 bolls of oats,
and from 4 to 6 bolls of bear.  Wheat, rye, hemp, flax,
are not cultivated in this corner.  About 64 acres only
are employed in raising turnip and potatoes.  The artifi-
cial grasses occupy about 490 acres.  The parish for the
most part supplies itself with articles of provision, and
rarely imports or exports.  Oats in general are sown
towards the middle and end of April, and reaped
in October.  Bear is sown about the beginnig of May,
and reaped in general in September.  Turnip are sown to-
wards the end of June.  About 135 or 140 acres are em-
ployed in raising forest-trees.  The valued rent of the pa-
rish is L. 2500:16:8 Scots.-The neighbourhood of
Aberden is advantageous to the parish, where it finds a 
ready market for every article of produce; and has but a
moderate distance to carry lime, etc. in return, for manu-
ring its fields.  Among its disadvantages, are to be num-
