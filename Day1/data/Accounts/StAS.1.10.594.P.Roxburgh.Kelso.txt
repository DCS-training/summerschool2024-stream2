letudinarians; yet, from the very favourable situation of the
town, their baneful effects are less felt here, than in any other
spot in the country.  There is no situation in the north
where the climate is so mild; which the author has observed
when travelling south in the spring, when the foliage of the
hedges and trees was more advanced about Kelso, than in
any situation north of York.
   It is true that the climate becomes colder in proportion as
one ascends from the Tweed, so much so, that at a mile or
two south or north from Kelso a considerable change is felt
in the air, and strongly marked in the progress of vegeta-
tion.
   However healthy the people are in this parish, which is
obvious from those proportion the advanced in life bear to the
whole number, and from only 1 in 32 dying annually, yet
many of the young and beautiful fall victims to consump-
tions, and other scrophulous affections.  These diseases are
frequent over all the north of England and south of Scot-
land.  This may in part be owing to the prevailing cold
east winds obstructing perspiration; to the constant vicissi-
tude of weather, to which our insular situation subjects us;
and to the inhabitants not paying due attention to their
clothing, nor to their persons, in point of cleanliness.  Their
diet, though chiefly farinaceous, and esteemed wholesome,

pudding, and boiled potatoes with milk; without deviation,
they all breakfast or sup upon the one or the other.  Most
