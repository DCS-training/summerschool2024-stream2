     Statistical Account

does not know that this castle is much celebrated in the
well-known works of Fingal.  At the distance of three
miles on the eastern shore stands castle I' Chamuis, i. e. the
Castle at the end of a Bay.  This structure is likewise
partly ancient, partly modern, one side being circular, and
covered with ivy, the other being built in the common
style of masonry.  This castle held out a siege, if I remem-
ber well, in the reign of James IV. from the Macleods,
who had obtained the Royal sanction for committing de-
predations on the country.  The siege was railed in a great
measure through the address and intrepidity of a lady,
styled, Mari Chaistail, i. e.  Mary of the Castle, her refi-
dence being probably in the castle or neighbourhood pre-
vious to the siege; it does not, however, appear, that this
heroine shared the same fate with the Maid of Orleans.
There are besides five duns, of which hardly any thing re-
mains but the name; such as, Dun-Phaick in Kilmore,
Dun-Flo in Tormore, Dun-Geilt in Carradle, Dun-Islay in
Ostaig, Dunan-Choinach; the three first are Danish.  At
Dun-Flo there may be seen a number of human bones, a
party of King William's troops having landed from a ship
of a Captain Porringer in the month of September 1688,
after having burned the house of Sir Donald Macdonald,
were by the natives forced to reimbank after a skismish
in which the Royalists were defeated with the loss of 26
men.  Dun-Islay seems to have taken its name from the
following circumstance; a party of the inhabitants of that
island, at a very remote period, landed in the neighbour-
hood of this rock, where they fortified themselves and
were at length cut off by the inhabitants.
