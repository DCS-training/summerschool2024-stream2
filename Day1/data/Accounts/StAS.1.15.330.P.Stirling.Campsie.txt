     Statistical Account

of this coup-dyke, the coal dips about fifteen feet, and then
they may work about three hundred yards into the hill, where
they seem to be cut off entirely by a whinstone dyke; so
there are two great barriers which intercept the ly of the
coal upon the North of the Glazert; the coal on the South
of the coup-dyke, takes on almost within six feet of the sur-
face, and is not above six inches thick, with something like
a clay roof.

   Manner of Working.-There is reason to believe that coal
has been wrough in this district for several centuries; but the
working of it seems to have been carried in a very aukward
irregular manner, taking advantage of the ly of the ground;
They used to make large excavations upon the surface,
which they termed creeping heughs; from these excavations,
they drove a road into the coal heads, and by this means
brought the coals to the hill, dragging them on their small
sledges up the declivity, which was not very great, as the ex-
cavation was always made as much to the dip side of the hill
as possible:  It is evident, that in this manner they could on-
ly work the crop of the coal, where the water created little dis-
quiet; a method, however, highly prejudicial both to the land-
lord and the public; the next stage of working was by sink
ing perpendicular pits, stiled windlass heughs.  On the North
of the river Glazert, these pits were in depth from sixty to nine-
ty feet; but they so contrived it, that these pits were placed
near some gully or burn, where, by running a level from a
certain part of the burn, all the coal round the pit bottom be-
came drained; and in the sinking of every new pit, they must
always do it with a retrospect to their former level; still,
however, the coal upon the dip side might be lying under
water; for although the declivity in the ground favoured
