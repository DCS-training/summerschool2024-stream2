     of Kilsyth.

   This burn formerly poured all its stream into the Kelvin;
after running close by the north side of the town.  But about
25 years ago, it was carried off by the canal company, by a
small canal, about a quarter of a mile above the town, into a
large reservoir about a mile to the east.
   The remaining burns are small in comparison with this.
And they are only distinguished by the great number and va-
riety of water falls, and milns erected upon them.
   The Inchwood burn is the boundary of this parish on the
west.  Next to that, is the Quinzie burn, on which there is
a lint and a corn miln.  On the Garrel burn, there is a ful-
lers miln, a lint and a buffing, a meal and a barley miln.
   In the east barony there is Shaw-end burn; on which
there is a threshing miln near its source, and a lint and buf-
fing, a barley, a corn, and a snuff miln farther down, and
below the great reservoir.  Near the eastern extremity of the
parish, is Auchincloch burn; on which there is in the course
of 60 yards, three lint milns, three buffing milns, and a
corn miln; and all of them, are well supplied with water.

   Bridges.-It is almost unnecessary to say, that along the
course of the great high road to Glasgow, there are bridges
across all those rivulets.  On Inchwood-burn, at Inchwood;
on Quinzie burn, at a farm house of that name; on Garrel
burn, at the town of Kilsyth; on Shaw-end-burn, at Shaw-
end; and on Auchincloch-burn, at Auchincloch.  Along the
same line of road, there is a number of smaller arches,
thrown over the several rivulets that cross it; which scarcely
deserve to be mentioned.  But the bridge of Carron over that
river; and of Auchinstenie over the Kelvin, are the largest,
and by much the most remarkable within the parish.  The
former consists of one large and a small arch.  The latter of
six small arches.  Of course its appearance is rather singular,
