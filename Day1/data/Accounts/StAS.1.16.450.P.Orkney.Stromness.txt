trade abroad; money received from shipping for fresh pro-
visions, or spent by seamen in the public inns; remittances
from those in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company.
There sources are more than sufficient to balance the a-
mount of imports, as appears evident, since the style of li-
ving has been greatly increasing for some years past; new
houses have been built every year; the trading people
have purchased lands when they came into the market for
sale; and there have been only two or three bankruptcies
among them for 3o years past; and prior to that period, they
were still more rare, and almost unheard of; so that, if what
great writer (Lord Kames) observes be true, that the num-
ber of bankruptcies prove the increase of trade, then the
trade of this village has been, and still is low.
   As the whole exports and imports amount only to
L. 6569:  16:  8, if we were to suppose a nett profit on the
whole of 20 per cent. this would only be L. 1313:  19:  3,
which, if divided among 26 shopkeepers, would be L. 50,
10 s. 8 3/4 d. to each.  This would appear a sum small enough
for the support of a family; nevertheless, by oeconomy
and strict attention to their affairs, the greater part of them
increase their capitals, build houses, purchase lands, and in
a course of 30 years, are in circumstances to retire from
business having realised L. 1000 or L. 2000, upon the in-
terest or returns of which, they live comfortably, and with
which they are as well satisfied, as the great merchants in
more opulent places when they have acquired a plumb of
L, 100,000.
