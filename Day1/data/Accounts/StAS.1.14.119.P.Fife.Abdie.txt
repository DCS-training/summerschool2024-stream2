     Of Abie.

     Though nature here might warm a Thomson's lay,
     Or a Salvatory Rofa's powers display;
     And richly grants, as genius may choose,
     Helvetian manners, and Helvetian views;
     Another hour may note the varying face
     Of vale and mountain, and their beauties trace;
     Our morning walks renew and frequent stand,
     To mark that Abdie is a Switzerland."

   Antiquities.-If gentlemens feats uninhabited, neglected,
or in ruins, may be included under this article, the parish
of Abdie has many antiquities, there being 8 mansion-
houses in it, Den Mill, Den Muir, Kinnaird, Ayton,
Lindores, Wood Mill, Berry Hole, Ormiston, either to-
tally deserted, or inhabited by tenants.  The mansion-
house of Kinnaird, mentioned by Sibbald as a large new
house, is now in ruins.  The mansion-house of Den Mill,
built 1679, is in the same state, and shows the havock of
time, and the more wasteful and deplorable steps of ad-
versity, supineness and neglect.  Indeed, while one looks
around him in the parish of Abdie, and marks the many
halls now silent, which, in a former century, were the
seats of hospitable festivity and joy, he finds some diffi-
culty in admitting, that Scotland is, at present, in a state
of higher improvement than it had attained in any for-
mer period.  The antiquities of Abdie extended beyond
the aera of the seats now mentioned.  On the summit of
Clatchart Crag, are the evident vestiges of a fortifica-
tion, or place of strength.  Sibbald says it had been a
strong castle.  Traces of fortifications on a larger scale,
are more visible on the top of Norman's Law, which,
from the situation, and height, and name, one is led to con-
sider as either the work of some of the northern invaders,
