first or historical part of that famous book " Naphtali, or the
wrestlings, of the Church of Scotland." *
   William Eccles, an indulged minister, seems to have been ap-
pointed to Paisley about the same time with Mr Ramsay (1669,)
whose aisistant was Mr Baird, and it is therefore probable his ap-
pointment was to the second charge.  The exact period of it we
have not been able to ascertain.  But he was deprived of his license
by the council on the 30th of January 1684. +
   John Taylor, formerly minister at Mearns, succeeded to this
charge in 1685.  He, like Mr Fullerton, was deprived at the Re-
volution.  This charge seems to have remained vacant from the
time of his removal till it was filled by
   Thomas Brown, as he is the next in succession, whose name ap-
pears in the records.  He was ordained on the 4th May 1698.
From this charge he was translated to the first in 1700, and from
that period, the second charge appears to have been vacant till the
ordination of
   Robert Mitchell, on the 22d September 1722, who, on the 21st
March 1739, was translated to the church and parish lately before
erected within the burgh of Paisley.
   William Fleming, previously minister of Kirkintilloch, succeed-
ed him, on the 26th June 1740; and died on the 2d January 1747.
   James Hamilton, who succeeded to this charge, was ordained
on the 24th April 1751.  He was soon after this translated to the
first charge.
   John Rae, his successor, was ordained on the 24th January
1751; and died on the 4th September 1757.
   Archibald Davidson, next in succession, was ordained on the
7th September 1758.  From this charge he was translated to
the parish of Inchinnan, on the 20th October 1761, and there-
after to the principality of the College of Glasgow.
   Alexander Kennedy, his successor, received ordination on the
10th June 1762, and died on the 12th July 1773.  He was suc-
ceeded by
   Robert Boog, who was ordained to this charge on the 21st
April 1774, and held it till his translation to the first, on the 29th
August 1782.
