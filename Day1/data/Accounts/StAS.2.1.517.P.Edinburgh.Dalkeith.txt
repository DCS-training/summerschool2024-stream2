is the cemetery belonging to His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch.
It contains a great many lead coffins. In the course of this cen-
tury the remains of His Grace Duke Henry, the Earl and Countess
of Home, Lord Cartaret, &c., have been deposited in it.
   A new burying-ground on the west of the town was granted to
the inhabitants in 1796, by His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch. It
is now almost entirely occupied.
   Manse.-The present manse was built in 1802. It is a small
but commodious house, situate near the Esk, on the left band as
we enter the town from the north. There is in front an orchard
or small pleasure ground, and a garden stretching southwards to-
wards the town. The glebe is in front of the manse, on the op-
posite side of the Edinburgh road, and consists of very nearly 8
imperial acres. It has long been let out as a nursery, and brings
an annual rent of L. 40.
   The stipend consists of L. 75, 13s. 9d. Sterling money; meal,
159 cwt., 2 quarters, 13 1/2 pounds; barley, 92 quarters, 6 bushels,
2 pecks, 1 gallon, 2 quarts, imperial weight and measure. There
is also a sum of about L. 1, 2s. per annum, collected in two pences
and fourpences, under the name of vicarage teinds.* There is
a further allowance of L. 12 for communion elements.
   Ministers of the Established Church.-Little more than a few
scattered names are to be found connected with this parish church
prior to the Presbytery record in 1582.
   A. D. 1545.-Archibald Boyd is recorded as provost of the Col-
ledge Kirk.
   1568-71.-Robert Wilsoun, minister, Dalkeith.++ Stipend
VjXXli.
   1576.-Maister George Ramsay, minister of Dalkeith.&
   1. Mr Andrew Symson is minister of Dalkeith at the commence-
ment of the presbytery record, in 1582. His name occurs till the
year 1584, when there is, a gap in the record. But at the year 1588,
when the minutes recommence Mr Archibald Symson is mentioned
in connection with Dalkeith. The probability is, that the first
mentioned minister is the famous Andrew Symson, master of the
school of Perth, and afterwards minister and master of the gram-
mar-scbool of Dunbar. He demitted his office at Dunbar on the
18th September 1582, and was succeeded there by Mr Alexander
