     Name, Situation, etc.

   The ancient name of one of these parishes was Montkeg-
gie; the origin and etymology of which are unknown.
Kinkell retains the old name, which is derived from the Gae-
lic, and signified the bead, or principal church.  It obtained this
name, because other six inferior parishes belonged to the parson-
age of Kinkell.  In 1754, the Lords Commissioners for the
plantation of Kirks, disjoined about one third part of the pa-
rish of Kinkell, and annexed to Keith-hall, or Montkeg-

and in the synod and county of Aberdeen.-They contain
