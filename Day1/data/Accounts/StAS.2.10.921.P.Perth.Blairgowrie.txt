   The best months for angling in this river are April and May for
salmon, and July, August, and September for grilse. The second
day after a flood, when the wind is from the east, and the sky cloudy,
but without any appearance of rain, the fish rise readily to the com-
mon salmon and grilse fly; and in the warm summer months,
when the river is low, they will sometimes readily take a minnow
in the deep pools early in the morning.

   Manufactures.--The only branches of manufacture carried on
here are the spinning of flax and tow into yarn, and the weaving
of these yarns into cloth of various fabrics. There are no fewer
than five spinning-mills in the parish, engaged in the first-men-
tioned branch of manufacture, and the machinery of all of them
is driven by water. Three of these are situated on the Ericht,
one on the Lornty Burn, and one on the Lunan, (a small stream
which forms the south-west boundary of the parish.)+ The fol-
lowing table shows the number of hands engaged at each of these
mills, distinguishing the males from the females:

   The flax used at these mills is imported into Dundee from the
Baltic ports, and, after being spun into yarn, is either reconveyed
to Dundee for sale there, or disposed of to manufacturers in the
neighbourhood, and in Alyth and Cupar-Angus. The value of
flax weekly consumed in the three mills at present in operation in
the immediate vicinity of the town, is from L.400 to L.500, or from

<FOOTNOTE>The writer of this account has no been able to obtain sufficient data to enable
him to hazard any estimate of the probable value of the produce of the unarable
ground pastured, or of the annual thinning and periodical felling of copse and plan-
tations, which is of a very fluctuating and uncertain nature.
          Besides the mills above enumerated, there is another large mill, (employing
above 200 hands), situated in the close vicinity of the town, in the adjoining pa-
rish of Rattray, a large proportion of the people engaged at which reside in the
town of Blairgowrie.
