wrought into worsted, and woven into carpets, for which there is
a regular demand. The manufactory is on the property of Sir
N. Menzies and receives from that spirited improver every pos-
sible encouragement.

                             III.-POPULATION.
  There are no sufficiently accurate data by which we can with
precision determine the ancient state of the population. The ma-
terials within our reach indicate a fluctuation, for the last hun-
dred years, between nearly 3000 and about 400 above that num-
ber. Thus by

  It thus appears, as indeed is generally the case in rural situa-
tions, that there is a considerable excess on the side of the  female
population.
  Emigration.-People have been emigrating from this district,
more or less, almost annually for many years back: and yet
the population does not appear to have altered in any very
sensible degree, in its general amount, for the last hundred
years;-a clear proof that, though emigration may relieve tem-
porarily the pressure of a redundant population, it is not suffi-
cient of itself, without the contemporaneous application of other
elements, to bring down the aggregate of a given number of years.
On the contrary, it may rather have the effect of stimulating po-
pulation, so as to do even more than fill up the ephemeral blank,
unless, along with the encouragement of emigration, there be also,
and simultaneously, the exercise of prudential habits, especially in
regard to marriage, on the part of the people, as well as the ob-
servance of a right economy on the part of proprietors in the letting
of land and cottages.
   Villages.-There are no towns, and even but few such assem-
blages of houses as are called villages. The only places worthy
of this name are Kenmore, with about 80 inhabitants, Sronfernan
with about 150, and Aeharn with about 90. The population is
thus entirely rural.
