heavy drawback on the value of the lands.  When the marle
pits are opened up, much will be saved to the parish.

   Rotations.-I almost blush to mention these.  A favourite
piece of convenient land has a great deal of indulgence shewn
it, when it is put under the following, viz. after manure, 3
crops of oats; dung and drilled potatoes; nay, twice or
thrice cut, and 2 or 3 years pasture.  This is severe enough,
as potatoes the only meliorating crop in the rotation, are
suspected to be an exhausting crop, though they clean the
soil.  But the greater part of the land, after lime, gives 3 or
4 crops of oats; and is then left out, quite bare of grass, and
poor, to stock itself the best way it can.  Lime is at present
a new manure, and does wonders; but our soil will not
stand repetitions of these rotations.

   Seed and Returns.-The quantity of oats given to an acre,
Annandale measure, is one Linlithgow boll and a half, in
seed.  The Annandale acre is larger than the Scots acre, in
the proportion of 153 to 137, or nearly as 15 to 13.  The
returns, in oats, average four seeds, or 6 bolls, or 12 Carlisle
bushels per acre.  Barley frequently fails to return as amply
as common bear.  Early pease do pretty well.  Beans and
wheat are scarcely to be considered in another light than as
strangers, not yet naturalized.  Early white oats are used, and
in rich land they do well.  On the heights they shake; the
straw is inferior fodder, compared with that of the common
oats; and they exhaust the soil more; but they divide the
labour; and in a moist season they stand better than common
oats.
   The best changes of seed that we get, are from the Clyde,
the Tweed, or the Teviot.
