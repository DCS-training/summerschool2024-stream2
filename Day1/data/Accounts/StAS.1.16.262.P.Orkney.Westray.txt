   Shipping, etc.-Two sloops of between 70 and 80 tons
burden belong to the island of Westray.  These vessels for
the most part are employed in carrying kelp to the mar-
ket.
   On the N. and W. of the island of Westray, there is one
good secure harbour, called Pyrawall; this harbour can
admit vessels only of a small burden.

   Antiquities.-At the head of the bay which forms the
harbour stands a stately Gothic ruin, called the castle of
Noltland, part of which has never been finished.  This
house is built at a small distance from the shore, and stands
on an eminence gently declining towards the sea.  The
face of the ground between this ruin and the sea is a beauti-
ful green, covered with the richest pasture in the summer

*Perhaps it may appear pretty odd that the list of shoemakers is so
small, and that there is no mention of coopers.  The reason is this, that
many in the parish can make shoes of a coarser kind, yet they do not live
by this business; so in like manner there are severals, who can work in
the cooper business, though none do it solely for their subsistence.
