     Of Westerkirk.

by Andrew, bishop of Glafgow, anno 1459*.  About a mile
from the present church there is a farm, the property of Sir
James Johnstone, but which formerly belonged to the family
of Glendonwyn, called Westerker, from which the parish
seems to have got its name; and this conjecture is the more
probable, that, on a neck of land between the Elk and the
Megget, and part of the farm of Westerker, there are several
large whin or moor stones placed in the ground erectly,
which are evidently the remains of a Druidical temple.  The
parish of Westerker might, in process of time, be named
Westerkirk, from the circumstance of its being the most west-
erly of the five kirks of Eskdale, commonly so called, viz.
Cannobie, Wauchope, Ewes, Staplegordone, and Westerkirk; of
the last of which the present parish of Eskdalemuir was a
part, till the year 1703, when it was erected into a separate.
establishment.  The farm of Westerker, from which the parish
is supposed to have got its name was probably so called from
its vicinity to, and its situation in respect of an ancient build-
ing in the neighbourhood.  There are vestiges of a castle on
the farm of Crooks, a great part of which was standing in
the memory of many of the present inhabitants.  Caer, in the
Gaelic language, signifies castle, and Wester-caer, or Wester-
ker, must mean a place to the west of the castle; and the farm
of Westerker seems to have been so called, because it lies a-
long the W. side of the Megget, opposite to, and distant not
more than 2 furlongs from the place where the castle former-
ly stood.

   Extent.-The length of the parish, from the N. to the E. ex-
tremities, is 9 miles; but as the boundaries on the N. and S. are
generally regulated by the water falls, or ridges of the moun-
