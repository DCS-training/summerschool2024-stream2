                    Some months ago Mrs Fry paid a visit to Greenock, with the
                view of directing the attention of the ladies and others to the state
                of our prison, and of impressing on them the duty of making per-
                sonal efforts for the instruction of the prisoners. The result of
                this visit was the appointment of a committee for the purpose con-
                templated by Mrs Fry; and also the formation of a scheme for
                the erection and maintenance of a house of refuge. A conside-
                rable sum has been'subscribed, but no fixed plan has been adopt-                                                                                 as been adopt-
                ed for its application.
                    According'to returns made to the Commissioners of Religious
                Instruction, the average extraordinary collections for religious and
                charitable purposes, of which an account has been kept, amount-
                ed, in the churches of the Establishment, to L.403, 2s. 10 1/2d., at
                the date of the making up of that report. It is believed that the
                returns now mentioned were exclusive of collections made at meet-
                ings of societies and other public meetings, which, on some occa-
                sions, have been very liberal.
                   The returns of extraordinary collections at the Dissenting
                churches, contained in the same report, do not, in most cases, dis-
                criminate between collections for behoof of the church And cha.
                pel, and for other religious and beneficent purposes. It is due,
                however, to one of these congregations, the United Secession
                church in Inverkip Street, to mention, that the extraordinary col-
                lections "for purposes beyond the bounds of the congregation,"
                rose progressively from L.11, 8s. 4 1/2d., which was their amount
                in 1831, to L.152, 8s. 4 1/2d., the amount in 1836.
