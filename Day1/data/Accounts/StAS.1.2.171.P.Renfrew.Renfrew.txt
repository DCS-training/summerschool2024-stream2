     of Renfrew.

   -Not far from this spot, on the north side of the road, the
Marquis of Argyle was taken, after he had crossed the river
on foot:-a party lay waiting for him the moment he came
out of the water; he attempted to fire upon them, but, his
pistols being wet, would not discharge, upon which, one of
the russians came behind him, and cut him on the head with
a sword; in the mean time, the Laird of Greenock came up,
knew the Marquis, and took him prisoner.  He was first
carried to Renfrew, and thence to Edinburgh, where he was
beheaded, on the 30th June, 1685.

   Population.-In 1695, it appears from the poll-books, that
there were in the country part of the parish 51 families; at
present there are 88.  At that time, and long after it, a great
part of the parish lay unimproved and uninclosed, merely in a
state of nature.  All these lands are now improved, inclosed,
and parcelled out in small farms.  In 1755, the return to Dr.
Webster, amounted to 1091.  In March, 1791, the popula-
tion of the parish of Renfrew, was as follows:
