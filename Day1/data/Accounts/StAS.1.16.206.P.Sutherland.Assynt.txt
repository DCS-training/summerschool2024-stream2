     Statistical Account

   There is the clearest evidence of the Druids having been
here in times of old, as to this day there is on the bounds
of Clachtoll farm (three miles directly inland from that
shore) a prodigious pile of huge stones close by a great rock,
having an entry through no less than we moderns would
call two half-moons; next appears an entry by a porch.
The narrator made an excursion from Torbreck to the
very place; he wished to have entered; but small stones
and earth had so much filled up the entry, that he could
not make his way.  However, a boy who attended went in.
He had in command not to go farther than the first apart-
ment he should meet, for fear of missing his way in return.
Having returned, he reported, that there were several
passages off the large room, into which he entered, and
that he thought there by appearance led to different cham-
bers.  This ancient ruin, in the Gaelic language, is at this
very period called, Ty-tal-vine-na-drui-nich, i.e.  The
earthly habitation of the Druids*.
   Further, at Ledbeg, a Druidical pruning hook was
found several years ago, in time of peat-cutting.  No per-
son here could tell what it was, or intended for, until the
present Earl of Bristol, then Bishop of Derry, happened, in
course of his northern excursion, to pass a few days and
nights in this parish.  It having been shown to his Lord-
ship, he instantly declared it, a Druidical pruning hook.
His Lordship further added, that several such were found
in England, and to be seen in the museums of the literati
there.  If the narrator remembers, Dr T. Smollet, author
of the history of South Britain, (vol. 1. at the very begin-
ning) makes mention of the Druids and their pruning
hooks, with which they did yearly cut the oak misletoe,

*The natives here traditionally tell, that the Druids had the knowledge
to make beer of the crop of heather, and to cure every wound.
