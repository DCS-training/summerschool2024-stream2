     of Tealing.

   About one sixth of the arable land is inclosed, and all
the farmers, it is believed, are convinced of the advantages
of inclosing.  The fences are mostly of stone.
   The people have improved much in dress and manners.
Among the men, instead of the bonnet and coarse home-
made woollens, the hat, English cloth and cotton stuffs,
are much worn, and almost every ploughman has his silver 
watch.  The women still retain the plaid, but among the
better sort it is now sometimes of silk or lined with silk,
and numbers of them, on occasions, dress in ribbons, prin-
ted cottons, white stockings and lasting shoes.  The la-
bouring servants, formerly ignorant and lazy, are now
generally skilful and laborious.  The wages both of men
and women are doubled.  The Sunday's collection, and
all the poors funds, are doubled.  The land-rent is more
than doubled.  The farmers live in a much more sociable
manner, and entertain with great hospitality.  Their
houses, formerly covered with thatch, are now generally
slated, and contain 2 floors.  There are some among them
that still adhere to the old method of farming, yet a con-
siderable number are well acquainted with the principles
of the new husbandry, and practice accordingly.  They
fallow; they manure with compost, marl and lime, some
of the last brought even from England; and they crop
judiciously.

   The heritors, notwithstanding the disadvantage most of
them lie under by residing at a distance, have all done
something in the way of improvement.  As Mr Scrymsoure
of Tealing resides on the spot, his improvements have
been extensive in proportion:  He has, within these 30
years, planted about 260 acres of moor-ground with trees
of different kinds; among which are many thousand
larches, (a tree which thrives here beyond most others);
inclosed and properly subdivided upwards of 300 acres
