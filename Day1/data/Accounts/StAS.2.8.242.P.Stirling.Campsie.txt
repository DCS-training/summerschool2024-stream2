wrought to some extent, but the distance at which they are situated from blast fur-
naces creates a heavy expense for carriage, and the coaf of this district is not suitable
for smelting the ores. The black-band ironstone has not been found in this district,
to which the above section belongs; but it is found to exist, and has been partially
wrought on the south side of the ridge, and in the neighbouring parish of Baldernock.
Its thickness varies from 12 to I8 inches, and is situated immediately above the coal,
forming part of the usual thickness of the coal stratum.

<FOOTNOTE> The terms employed in the above register are for the most part provincial, but
we believe they are pretty generally understood by persons conversant in mining
operations. It was hoped, as formerly stated, that by putting down a bore in the
lower ground of the strath, the finer coal measures, lying to the south and east, might
have been found uderlying those of this district. But from the unfavourable ap-
pearance presented at the termination of the above bore, it was apprehended that
these must lesset or crop out before reaching this distance. This trial is so far satisfac-
tory, that it resolves all conjectures as to the obtaining of coal at any depth, which would
allow of its coming into competition in point of expense of working, with the more
easily obtained coal of the higher level of the district. Regarding the latter it may be
stated in conclusions, that, though a great part of it has been wrought out, particularly
within the last thirty years, very large fields of it still remain, especially in the south
side of the valley, and ample supplies for many years to come are likely to be found, for
even the increasing consumption of the parish. Hitherto, as a matter of economy, those
portions of the coal-field which lie in the higher elevations, have been wrought so as
to obtain day levels for draining off the water at the least expense into the river;
and, in very few instances, has it been found necessary to employ engines for this
purpose. In following the dip of the coal, however, to the south-east it will, no doubt,
be found necessary to adopt this mode of draining the water, where the bed of the
coal falls below the level of the river, and day levels are rendered impracticable.
