by an overflowing of the Tweed in 1797 ; and it was finished in
1803, at an expense, including the approaches, of about L. 18,000.
The total length of building is 494 feet, the breadth of the road-
way is 25 feet, and its greatest height from the foundation, which
extends 15 feet below the bed of the river, is 57 feet.  The
arches, five in number, are elliptical, the span of each arch being
72 feet, and that of the piers 14.  The singular elegance of this
bridge is the more fortunate, as its situation renders it the most
prominent object in some of the finest landscapes on the Tweed.
Connecting two banks, each remarkable for beauty, it forms the
eye of a vast variety of pictures, while by its breadth of mellow
light it affords a striking contrast and relief to the dark colour of
the wooded scenery on either side.  This bridge forms the entrance
to the town from the south; and few scenes are more imposing than
that which opens upon the tourist as he descends from the oppo-
site village of Maxwellheugh with the prospect beneath him of this
fine architectural object, the majestic Tweed, the picturesque
town and abbey, and the noble back ground or the castle, woods,
and surrounding heights of Floors.

                  III.-POPULATION.
  Former and present state.--No data exist for ascertaining the
amount of the population, prior to the middle of last century,
Since that time, there has been a slow but nearly constant increase,
as appears from the following table of its amount, at successive
periods from 1749.

  Causes of Fluctuation.--The only remarkable increase indicated
above, that of the thirty-eight years, from 1755 to 1793, receives
a ready explanation from the change which was then in progress,
from the system of small to that of large farms; a change which
necessarily drove the petty farmers and labourers from the rural
districts to the market-town.  Two circumstances have tended, in
recent times, to keep the ratio of increase below that of many
