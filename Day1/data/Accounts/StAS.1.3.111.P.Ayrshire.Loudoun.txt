     of Loudoun.

   Poor.-There are no sums of money mortified for the
poor.  The heritors, minister, and session, have a joint meet-
ing annually, and appoint the pensions for the poor, general-
ly from 1 s. to 2 s. weekly.  In the interval, betwixt the an-
nual meeting, the session, from time to time, takes in new
annuitants.  The conduct of the poor is examined at each
annual meeting.  The schoolmaster is allowed from the
funds, wages for poor scholars.  The whole expence annually
amounts to L. 50.  The funds chiefly arise from the weekly
collections, the mort-cloth money, and the seat-rents of the
church.  The trustees of Lady Loudoun allow generally
L. 10 annually to the poor's funds.
