   Antiquities.-Of this parish, the most memorable anti-
quity is the ruinous palace of Falkland, which, for many
years, was the occasional residence of the Royal Family of
Scotland.-On the S. side of the Eden, directly between
Falkland and Auchtermuchty, are the remains of what is
called a Danish camp.  That it was so, is probable from
the name of a neighbouring village, Dunshelt, supposed to
be a corruption of Danes-halt, and to have derived its
name from the circumstance of the Danes having formed
an encampment in its vicinity.  Another circumstance adds
to the probability of the tradition, that it is of a circular
form.  The remains of this camp consist of five concentric
circular trenches, nearly equidistant from one another, and
seem to have been separated only by the bank of earth
thrown up from each.  The centrical spot inclosed by the
first trench is about 22 feet diameter, and where they are
not demolished, the trenches are at present from 10 to 15
feet wide.-On the E. of Nuthill, and nearly half a mile
W. from the house, are 4 parallel trenches, in the form of
inverted wedges, of from 250 to 300 yards in length, evi-
dently the work of art.-And the same is to be said of
what is called the Maiden Castle, on the same estate, situ-
ated above half a mile distant, on the S. side of the green
hill already mentioned.  It is an oblong circular mound,
gradually rising from a level on the E. to a steep and ab-
rupt termination on the W. of nearly 400 yards in cir-
cumference, and, except the steep part of the W. and the
level on the E. where are the remains of a stone wall, is
surrounded with a ditch of 12 feet wide.
