remembered, however, that there was then not merely a populations
of about 4000 in this place, but be had many patients in neighbour-
ing parishes. He had altogether 785 cases, and the following were
the diseases that most frequently occurred: Fever.--Continued
fever, 84; typhus or nervous, 20; inflammatory, 18; biliary, 12;
total, 134.--Peripneumouy, 85; catarrhs, 33; colics, 21; con-
sumption, 19; rose, 18; headache 18; enteritis, 17; rheumatism,
16; children's complaints, 114.
  It may help to elucidate the subject still farther, to give the
following statement: There were in 1828 ninety-five deaths, the
greatest number I have known,in one year, though the summer was
warm and genial; still-born, 6; below 10 years of age, 35; from
10 to 20, 5; from 20 to 30, 4; from 30 to 60, 11; from 60 to
70, 17; above 70, 17; total, 95. In January, 3 deaths; Febru-
ary, 8; March, 10; April, 8; May, 10; June, 8; July, 13; Au.
gust, 11; September, 11; October, 7; November, 3; Decem-
ber, 3.
  It will thus be seen that there were more deaths during the fine
summer of this year than during the winter; but this fact, and the
health of the inhabitants during the wet year, 1830, I should think
rather anomalies than fair specimens of the effects of wet and
warm weather.
   Hydrography.--Springs are numerous throughout the parish,
but none are of a remarkable character. The village is at all sea-
sons well supplied in this manner with good water, which rises out
of the sandy soil upon which it is built. In other places they flow
from almost every kind of rock. Springs impregnated with carbo-
bonate of iron are found in the Misty Law moor and elsewhere.
There is a spouting spring strongly impregnated with this substance
in a bank a little west from Barr Castle. It rises from an opening
made in the earth when mining for coal, and at One time spouted
two or three feet above the ground. Now it is covered with a pump,
and used as a well by a family, in the neighbourhood, who are very
sensible of the peculiarity of its taste, and the excellence of its qua-
lities.
    The only large lake in the parish is Castle-Smple Loch, Which
was once much larger than at present, but  it still covers about 200
acres of ground. Its lenght is much greater than its breadth. It
contains three small wooded islets, and is  surrounded by the beau-
tiful scenery of Castle-Semple, already described. The mansion-
house stands on its north side, near its eastern extermity. It is fur-
