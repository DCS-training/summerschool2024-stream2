In the course of the minister's incumbency, upon a fort of
gross recollection, there have been sold by different proprie-
tors, about L. 1600 worth of woods; consisting of oak, ash,
alder, birch, and hazle.  The smaller kind was manufac-
tured into charcoal, and sent to the furnaces at Whitehaven;
the larger kind was sent for ship-timber to different ports,
and a great part was bought by tradesmen, and other round
the country.-There are 7 marl-pits in the parish, some of
which are mostly exhausted.  It is said, that this manure
was discovered and used in a farm here, about 50 or 60
years ago, before it was used in any other part, at least in
the south of Scotland.  Luxuriant crops were raised by it
at first, and the people continued to plough, till the ground
was reduced to a caput mortuum.  They now know well
how to manage it, by taking sewer crops, and laying the
last down with dung and grass-seeds, though it is found that
the frequent repetition of mark, especially upon thin land,
does little good, or rather is hurtful, by loosening the soil
so much, that the corn-plants are thrown out at a certain
time.  They who have no marl, bring lime to their lands
from Closeburn or Barjarg, 2 farms at the distance of 8 or
10 miles, or from the harbour below Dumfries, at the
distance of 7 or 8 miles.  At least every farmer now, al-
most, brings some lime, less or more to his possession.-The
valued rent of the parish is L. 4415:19:8 Scots money,
and the real rent at present is about L. 2770 Sterling.  No
services are paid by the tenants in general.

   Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-Stipend and glebe are not
worth above L. 80 a-year.  The walls of the church have
been built time out of mind, and are still firm and strong.
