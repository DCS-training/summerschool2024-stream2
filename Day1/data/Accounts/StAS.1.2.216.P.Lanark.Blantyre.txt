number of inhabitants above 8 years old, was about 400.  The
number of families, including every individual who possessed a
separate lodging, was 130; ard, calculating at the rate of 
4 to a family, the number of souls might be about 520.  The
annual average of births, for ten years preceding 1787, was
17,-of deaths, during the same period, 11,-and of marria-
ges, 6.  Since the year 1787, when the cotton mill began to work,
the population has been making continual and rapid progress;
and, as the machinery is not nearly completed, they are still
daily increasing.  The numbers at the cotton mill were not ex-
actly ascentained, till the 14th of March, 1791; and, at that
date, they stood as follows :

*These children are in general orphans, between 8 and 12
years of age.  They are generally bound to the work by their re-
lations, for a few years; and are fed, cloathed, and lodged by the
proprietor of the mill.  He has a school-master employed in
teaching them at their spare hours; a surgeon to attend them
when sick :  And much praise is due to such a guardian of
youth, for his attention both to their health and education.
