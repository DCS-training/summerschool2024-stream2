thus too fixed.  The other is, that of granting leases for
lives, or for a great number of years, upon fines, etc. so that
the interest of the tenant in his possession becomes greater
than that of the proprietor.  In this part of the world, a
medium has been sought.  Few leases are granted for less
than 19 years; and it is now, indeed, not so much the ques-
tion with a tenant, whether his industry will redound ulti-
mately to the benefit of his landlord, or of a succeeding te-
nant, as whether it will pay him, (the present possessor) in
conformity to his skill and outlay.-' If the farm (now rea-
'sons the latter) is worth 10 l. a year more, at the end of my
'lease, I may just as well give that for it, as for any other of
'equal value.'  After all, it is probable that longer leases
than those of 19 years would be favourable to permanent
improvements, such as hedges, etc. and it must be owned,
that as the lease draws near a close, the tenant is often found
comporting himself, as if under a conviction that he inhabi-
ted hostile ground.  To say the truth, however, that nar-
rowness of mind, or aristocratical; pride, which adjusted every
matter of lease, to the visible purpose of keeping tenants in
abject dependante upon their landlords, has of late been
put very much to the blush.  Through all Galloway, as well
as in Buittle parish, a prodigious alteration took place in
landed property, through the fatal American war, and the
scarce less deplorable concern of the Douglas and Heron
Bank.  Most of the estates brought to sale in this county,
were purchased by natives of it-men acquainted with the
world, and in affluent circumstances.  These knew better
things than to ruin themselves with Baillie-work*, to put
their importance on the number of kain hens paid them by
ragged cottagers; or to recommend their own affability, by
