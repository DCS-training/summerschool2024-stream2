   Of woollen manufacture, knitted stocking seems the
best, as requiring most manual labour, and affording the best
recompense for it.
   A stone bridge over the Findern, and another over the
Big-bourne, on the post-road, would be of great advantage
to this parish, for an open communication to all the villages
and towns west of the river, with Forres and Elgin.  For
want of this, the daily posts are often long detained, lives
are frequently endangered, and sometimes lost.  In 1781,
II were lost by the oversetting of the ferry-boat on the day
of a Forres market.  On such occasions, there is no prevent-
ing the people from overloading the boat.
   The fervitude of thirlage, remains yet a dead weight upon
agriculture.  It retards all improvements in the machinery
and art of grinding, occasions great waste of time, indiffe-
rent service, and vexatious debates and law-suits, about ab-
stracted multures.  A conversion of all multures, and a con-
sequent freedom to grind wherever people found themselves 
best served, and the acceptance of an equivalent, for buying
off the astriction of one heritor's lands to another heritor's
mills, would bring thing to rights, and make a great 
change for the better.  This measure, adopted by general
consent, would be a laudable concession to public utility;
and, on supposition of full indemnification, could do no pre-
judice to any.  This measure was long since adopted in the 
county of Clackmanan.  Its happy effects were soon obser-
ved, in an emulation among the millers, to excel in their
machinery, and art, and promp service; and the corn yield-
ed considerably more meal than ever it had formerly pro-
duced, in consequence of an improved management.
   The sale of all grain by a common standard of weight,
will be generally approven.
