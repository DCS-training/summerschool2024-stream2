winning and leading peats, ploughing and harrowing, ma-
king hay, cutting down corns, and various carriages.  These
services, though not exacted with rigour, are detrimental
to the interest of the tenant, and consequently to that of
the landholder.  They often occasion interruptions to ur-
gent domestic concerns, sometimes prevent the seasonable
cultivation of the fields, and not unfrequently hazard the
safety of their produce.  It is astonishing, that heritors.
in many respects liberal minded and indulgent to their te-
nants, still continue this pernicious vestige of feudal slve-
ry. 

   Wages and Prices.-The wages of servants 'have in-
'creased, are increasing, and, in the opinion of the farmer,
'ought to be diminished.' A capable ploughman receives
from L. 6 to L. 7; an inferior man-servant L. 5; and a 
female servant L. 2, 2 s. a-year.  These gains are not now,
as formerly, laid up for future support and provision, but
generally expended upon dress, the desire of which has ob-
tained great prevalence among them within these few
years.  The following wages are given to other labourers
a-day:  To a man for casting peats, 1 s. without victuals,
in harvest, to a man 10 d. and to a woman 6 d. with 
victuals; to a day-labourer 6 d. with victuals; to a mason
1 s. 2 d.; to a common wright 8 d.; and to a tailor 6 d.
with victuals.  The prices of provisions have increased very
considerably within these 30 years.  A hen, formerly
bought for 4 d. now gives from 6 d. to 8 d.; beef and
mutton fell from 2 1/2 d. to 3 1/2 d. the pound; haddocks,
which sold withi these five years at 2 d. the dozen,
now give from 8 d. to 1 s.  This great and sudden rise in
valur, is said to be owing to a scarcity of haddocks along
this coast for two years past.  Butter sells from 6 d. to 8 d.
