   Agriculture.-The vicinity of all the cultivated lands in
this district to the sea shore, induced of old and still induces
the inhabitants to use sea-weed as their chief, and almost on-
ly manure.  The great quantities of it thrown into their nu-
merous bays, creeks, and about their nesses, enabled them
to adopt a practice which is still continued, of putting one
half of their laboured land to bear or bigg, which half they
put to oats the year following; this short rotation they have
continued for time immemorial.  They lay their house dung
on the land designed for bear, usually before Christmas; the
field on which this is laid, they keep perpetually at bear, ex-
cept once in six or seven years, when it becomes too rich
and spungy; they then having kept back the manure, take
a single crop of oats, and go on as before with bear crops.
The side plough, with four horses abreast, or in broad band,
is most generally used.  The plough-boy walks with a retro-
gade motion, having his face towards the horses faces.  The
extent of field which such a plough labours, is about fifteen
acres Scots measure.
   The number of returns of oats is from three to fours and
of bear from five to six seeds, at an average.  Potatoes were
not generally planted fifteen years ago, when the present in-
cumbent was admitted minister; and, where they were planted,
it was on the green sward, in the lazy bed way.  These are cul-
tivated more generally, and are usually planted after the
plough, in land which has been long in tillage.  They thrive
well, When kept clean from weeds.  Few farmers have as yet
been induced to plant them at so great a distance as to ad-
mit of their being horse hoed or cleaned by the plough; a
successful example in this way, nevertheless, hath more than
once been exhibited to them.  Clover and rye-grass feeds,
during the period before mentioned, have been sown as hay
