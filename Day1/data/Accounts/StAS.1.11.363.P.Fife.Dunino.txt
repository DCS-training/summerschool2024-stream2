are stated as regulated by the county fiars; or rather, by the
general state of the market.-The yearly wages of a labouring
man-servant, are 7 L.; and those of a woman, 3 L.  The day-
labourer has 1 s. a day, without meat; 2 s. 2 d. per acre, for
hay cutting; and for making ditto, or for turnip hoeing, either
by males or females 6 d., and sometimes 7 d. per day.  The
price of a goose here is commonly 3 s.; a hen, 1 s.; and egg,
3 1/2 d. a dozen; butter sells at 8 d., and cheese from 3 d. to 6 d.
per pound; pigeons, 3 d. a pair; chickens at 4 d. each; rab-
bits, (animals very common in the parish of Denino), at 6 d.
a pair, without the skin; and butcher meat, universally at 4 d.
per pound.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The manse, almost thrown down from
the foundation, and rebuilt, on a durable construction, about
the year 1741, is a tolerably decent house, 2 stories high,
and contains 6 moderately good rooms, with a kitchen, and
some other apartments.  Since its last erection, it has un-
dergone very many repairs.  The glebe contains little
more than 4 1/2 acres of English measure, worth about 1 L. 10 s.
per acre, if duly cultivated.  The stipend consist of 24 L. in
money, with 5 chalders, or 80 bolls of victual; the one half
meal, and the other bear.  The whole annual income, ex-
clusive of the manse, and a tolerably good garden, is about
90 L. Sterling.  The church is one of the smallest of country
churches, perhaps, with an aile, and a small porch by one of its
front doors.  It is uncertain when it was built; but some persons
are perfectly sure of its having been very lately and very ma-
terially repaired.  Mr. JAMES BROWN, ordained 13th May
1790, is the present minister of Denino.

   School.-The school house is a very short, low, thatched
house, and, though not very old, a very crazy edifice.  The
