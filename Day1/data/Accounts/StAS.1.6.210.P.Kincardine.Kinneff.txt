     Statistical Account

begun to stimulate industry, the mode of living among our
people is very much changed.  They are much better lodged,
fed, and clothed, than they were 20 years ago.  A joint of
meat, and a kan of punch after it, will be seen on every
farmer's table in the parish, when a friend comes to dine with
him.
   As this part of the coast lies at some distance from any sta-
tion of excise or custom-house officers, it has been long famous,
or rather infamous, for smuggling.  By this the morals of the
people are considerably hurt, as they often meet with temp-
tations to drunkenness, theft, and perjury, in the course of
that business.  This illicit traffic has, however, considerably
declined on this coast of late, owing to the successful vigilance
of the cruizers appointed for that purpose.
   The public and private roads in this parish are very indiffe-
rent.  The post-road from Bervie to Stonehaven goes through
it for more than four miles.  But we are sorry to say that here,
as in many other places, the statute-labour (as it is applied)
has been found inadequate to produce the intended effect.
The gentlemen of the county convinced of this, intend ap-
plying to Parliament, to authorize them to commute the sta-
tute-labour, or establish turnpikes.  The general voice of the
county is in favour of the first.
   There are few inclosures, and those only of earth, which is
found to answer the purpose only for a short time.  No stones
can be got but from quarries at an immense expence; and the
parish being much exposed to the sea, thorns are prevented
from growing.  The farmers are so much convinced of the
advantages of inclosing, that they would give from 5 s. to 7 s.
an acre for effecting it.
   In 1782, the crop in the parish was not sufficient to main-
tain its inhabitants, though grain is the staple of this district.
The scarcity began to be felt severely about the end of May
