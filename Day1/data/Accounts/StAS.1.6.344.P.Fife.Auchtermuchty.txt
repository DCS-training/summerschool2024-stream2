manufactories, being situated in a healthy fertile country.-A
gentleman from Glasgow proposes to establish a tambour branch
immediately, which must contribute to the prosperity of the
town, as thereby a number of children, who at present can
be of no service either to themselves or their parents, will find
employment.  It must also be an eligible situation for an
woolen branch, considering its vicinity to the Lomond hills,
and the frequent opportunities of conveying wool from the
Ochils.  Such is the spirit of industry and enterprize, which
now actuates the inhabitants, that a manufactory of that sort
could not fail to succeed.  From the books of the stamp-mas
ter of Auchtermuchty, it appears that, from 1st November
1790 to 1st November 1791, he stamped

   Great part of the above must be manufactured in the town,
and the immediate neighbourhood, as there are stmap offices
in Falkland and Newburgh, which are within two and three
miles of Auchtermuchty.  An ordinary journeyman weaver
will work 9 spindles in a week, at 1s. per spindle, but others who
are more expert at their business, will weave 17 spindles
at the same rate.  L. 50,000 sterling is annually expended by
green linen merchants in this town for that article*.

*Wages within these 20 years are more than double, at that period 5d/
haispenny per spindle, was the ordinary price.  Lanourers now receive 1s.
