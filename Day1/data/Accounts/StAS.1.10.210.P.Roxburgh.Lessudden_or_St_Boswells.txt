church, (which is from 5 L. to 6 L. in the year), together with
what is brought in by the mort-cloth and the dues upon
marriage proclamations, is employed by the kirk-session to
give occasional assistance to the necessitous not on the poor's
roll, and at times to add to the comfort of those who receive
the bounty of the heritors.

   Fuel.-This necessary of life we are obliged to procure at
an expence which with difficulty we are able to afford.  There
are many cases in which a moderate competency of firing, to
put over the severity of the winter, takes most of the money
which a family of decent working people, after maintaining
themselves, can be supposed to save.  All honest, though
humble shifts, are therefore made to provide and save fuel.
Coals are the common, and indeed the cheapest firing.  They
are brought to this place either from the collieries in Lothian,
which are at the distance of 27 or 28 miles, or from Eta1 in
Northumberland, which is 24 or 25 miles distant.  But the
greatest part of what is used here, comes from the Lothians,
and is brought by the returning carts, which carried from
home oat-meal or grain to Dalkeith market.  A cart with 2
horses commonly brings 14 cwt. of coals, which cost the pur-
chaser 1 s. per cwt. and yet the driver is said to have but
poor profits.  From this almost unsupportable expence, which
is more likely to increase than decrease, perhaps nothing can
deliver this part of the country, unless the canal which has
been spoken of as intended to come to Ancrum bridge,
should be carried into effect.  To this scarcity, and conse-
quent high price of firing, may be imputed in part the too
common complaint of rheumatism, or what some of the
people call the pains, which are often very distressing, and
too often not well treated by the patients themselves.
