   Manufactures.- Under the head of m`nufactures, the first place
is due to Stanley cotton-mills. They are situated between the
village and the house of the same name on the margin of the river
Tay; and consist of spinning and weaving mills, propelled by
seven water wheels, equal to 200 horse power, and affording em-
ployment tn 1000 people. These works were first built by George
Dempster and Co. in 1785, and continued in their possession till
1800, when they were bought by James Craig and others, who
carried them on till 1814, when the works stopped till 1823, when
they were bought by the present company, by whom, at vast ex-
pense, they have been brought to their present state of magnifi-
cence and efficiency.  There has recently been some change in
the copartnery of the works; and I believe the present firm is
" Buchanan and Sons." The fall of water is 16 feet, and the supply
being from the Tay, never fails, though sometimes it is in such super-
abundance as to stop the works. The lade or water course is car-
ried across a hill 150 feet high, by means ofa mine 800 feet long, 8
feet high, and 10 feet wide, arched and paved throughout. Pre-
vious, however, to the construction oftbis subterranean channel, two
others were formed through the same bill at different times,-the
earlier by John Lord Nairne in 1729, -for the purpose of driving
a corn-mill; and the latter by Dempster and Co. in 1785, when
the works were first erected. The circumstance of a mine of such
extent having been formed at the period referred to, shows the pub-
lic and enterprising spirit of the nobleman under whose auspices,
and at whose expense it was undertaken and executed. It is told
of his Lordship that he superintended the transporting of the first
millstones across the Tay, at the Norlane boat, the only ferry on
the river in the parish and in those days, there being, neither car-
