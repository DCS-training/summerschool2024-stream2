perfect purity. No traces of shells, or of any other fossil remains
are to be found in it. Hence, it is believed to be of older forma-
tion that that found at Corrie, and other parts of the island.

   All varieties of soil are to be found in the parish. Near the
shore it is sandy or gravelly ; beyond this, it is generally clayey,
and in the vicinity of the hills, which are nowhere above a mile
and a-half from the sea, it is mossy. The straths along the river
sides are rich loam.
   The only mines wrought in the parish, are the limestone quar-
ries of Clachan and Glenloig, and these but to a limited extent,
owing partly to their difficulty of access, partly to their distance
from the arable land, but chiefly to the want of fuel to burn the
stone.
   Botany.--Arran is a field that has hitherto been but little cul-
tivated by the botanist. It is seldom that he has penetrated its
wild and sequestered glens, or climb its alpine heights; but
when at any time he has done so, he has been amply repaid for
his toil ; and I doubt not, when it is fully explained, it will be found
as rich plants as in minerals. We subjoin a list of the rarer
plants of the parish, with their localties.
