     Statistical Account

Besides the first Earl above mentioned, there were three o-
ther Earls of Strathearn, who succeeded each other, of the
name of Malise; but none of that family seem to have as-
sumed any surname.  The seventh Earl, also named Malise,
died without issue, after marrying Joanna, daughter of Sin-
clair, Earl of Orkney, who, in 1320, was concerned in a plot
against Robert l. for which, according to some accounts,
she was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, and the Earl-
dom forfeited.  But Mary, aunt of the last mentioned Earl,
had married Sir John Moray of Drumsargard, who got with
her the lands of Abercarney and others.  Her son, Sir Mau-
rice Moray, is said to have been the last Earl of Strathearn,
and was, with David II. and many Scotch noblemen, taken
prisoner at the battle of Durham, in 1346.  Hence the pre-
sent heritor of Abercarney, descendent of the said Sir Mau-
rice Moray, is regarded as the lineal heir and representative
of the ancient Earls of Strathearn.
