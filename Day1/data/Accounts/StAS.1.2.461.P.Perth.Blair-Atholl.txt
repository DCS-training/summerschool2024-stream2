     Origin of the Names.

   These parishes commonly go by the name of the united
parishes of Blair-Atholl, and Strowan.  They con-
sisted formerly of the parishes of Blair-Atholl, Strowan,
Lude, and Kilmaveonog.  Blair (Blar) properly signifies a 
plain clear of woods and other incumbrances: but the Cel-
tae, of whom the Gael were a branch, in general, chusing
such plains for their fields of battle, Blar came at lenght to
signify a battle.  Strowan (Sruthain) signifies streams,
so called from the confluence of the Garry and the Erochty at
that place.  These streams seem to have given that parish its
name, and Robertson of Strowan, (in English, Robertson of 
the Streams), his title.  Kilmaveonog, signifies the place of
worship, or burial place* of St. Eonog, or Veonog.  Lude,

   Cella (Kella), sancti, or rather santae, Eonog.  Cuil and
