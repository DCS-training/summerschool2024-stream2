   No IV.  Extract of a Letter from the Reverend Dr Blair, dated 15th
April 791.

   I am very happy at there being such a general consent through the coun-
try, in seconding your patriotic views, of obtaining a satisfactory Statis-
tical Account of Scotland.  The Clergy seem to have exerted themselves
