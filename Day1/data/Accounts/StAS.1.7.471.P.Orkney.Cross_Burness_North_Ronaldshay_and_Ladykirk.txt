horned cattle, great and small, sheep, and swine, in these
parishes, has been collected from the several tenants, and the
most intelligent farmers, with as much precision and accu-

them, it may be necessary to observe, that, if any calculation
should be made of the value of them, as they are all of a
small size, it is to be observed, that to estimate the horses at
3 l. each, horned cattle, great and small, at  1 l. or 1 l. 5 s.
sheep at 2 s. 6 d. each, is a high computation.  It will ap- 
pear there are a great number of horses, which must be kept 
for the purpose of carrying the sea-ware, which they do by
two wooden creels, which are square and ribbed, and one
placed on each side of the horse, the bottom of which opens, 
so as to let the ware upon the ground it is intended to
manure.  Oxen are used only for carts, and few or none for
ploughing.
