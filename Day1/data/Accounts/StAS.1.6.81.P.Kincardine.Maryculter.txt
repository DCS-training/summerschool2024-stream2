   The Dee, which washes the north side of the parish for a-
bove 6 miles, is famous for its salmon, which are caught by
slat-bottomed skiffs and nets.  There are 5 salmon-fishings in
the parish.-This stream frequently overslows its, banks,
particularly in May and June, after a snowy winter, which
often damages the sown land: but the most hurtful floods u-
sually happen in September, when they carry off great quan-
tities of cut grain, and level the standing corn among the sand.
A remarkable flood occurred on the 17th September, 1768,
by which many suffered considerably.-There is a ferry for
horses, carriages, etc. opposite to the manse.

   Rent, Natural Productions, etc.-Including the farms in
the possession of the heritors, and the fishings, the rent of the
whole parish will amount to L. 1000 sterling.  There are 28
ploughgates of land in this district; 20 of which belong to
one heritor, and other two gentlemen have 4 each.  Black
cattle have been fed here, that sold from L. 20 to L. 25 each.
The produce of the parish more than supplies the inhabitants
with provisions.  The old rents were made up of money, meal,
bear, sheep, hogs, lambs, poultry, butter, eggs, and manual
services; but, of late years, those called ipsa corpora are all
converted into money.-Red and white clover and rye-grass
are sold by many of the farmers, as also turnips.  Some of
the best arable land is let at 20 s. and some of the worst pas-
ture at 5 d. per acre.-In the minister's glebe is a quarry of
granite.  A large portion of the parish is covered with wood.
In Kingcausie-wood are some deer of the roe kind, of a small
size, increasing in number every year.-The parish in general
is uninclosed.  The people are convinced of the advantages of
inclosing, but have neither money, nor length of leases, suffi-
cient for that purpose.
