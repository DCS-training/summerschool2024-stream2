down the largest trees.  But the expence of getting them
out of the forest is very considerable; and as the trees are
always squared with the axe, the wood is not so economi-
cally managed, as if there were a law-mill, and proper ma-
chinery for carrying the large logs from the forest.  As a
proof of the fineness of the wood, the writer of this account
numbered 130 concentric circles on a tree of 11 inches
diameter*.

   A Canal proposed.-If a canal could be made out from
Aberdeen to Aboyne, this extensive forest would produce
L. 1500 a-year to the proprietor.  Perhaps such a canal is
not only practicable, but could be made at much less ex-
pence than might be expected, from the rapidity of the
rivers, and the great elevation of the parish of Aboyne;
but it should not be attempted near the banks of the Dee.
The writer of this account believes, that by raising a canal
from Aberdeen at once to the level of Hazlehead, there
would be almost a dead level, and at any rate, no occasion
for more than one lock for six miles above Hazlehead.  This
canal should probably be carried past Cannieglirach, Him,
Rameir, Glassel, and Kincardine.  A branch of it could
be conducted past Skene, Cluny, Monymusk, and perhaps
nearly to Alford; and till the increasing commerce of the
county enabled the proprietors to make out locks from
Hazlehead to Aberdeen, a distance of two miles, a carriage-
way could be used at a moderate expence.  With a little
more public spirit, and also by laying out their money
with economy, the proprietors of land in Aberdeenshire
may make out canals, where they at present account them

*The forest of Glentanar has been twice burned; once, as was suppo-
sed, by accident.  The young wood suffered, but the old wood received no
hurt, except being a little singed.
