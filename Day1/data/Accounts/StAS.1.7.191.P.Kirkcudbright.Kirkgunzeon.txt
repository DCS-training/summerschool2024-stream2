   Population.-The number off souls in this parish was, in
1755, 489; at present the number is 520; the number of
inhabited houses is 103; there are 7 more males than fe-
males.  There are two men of 90 years old, and several of
80 and upwards.  The average of births, for the last 5 years,
has been 18; of marriages, 3; of deaths, 10.

his parishioners, all of whom did well and recovered, with-

in money.  The glebe contains near 11 acres of very good
land, lately inclosed and subdivided.  The manse was built
about 40 years ago, is in decent repair, and pleasantly situat-
ed in a small valley, which is intersected by a fine trouting
river.  The offices have been built about 5 years, and are
very complete.  The church, which has originally been a
Romish chapel, is almost in a state of ruin; but is proposed
