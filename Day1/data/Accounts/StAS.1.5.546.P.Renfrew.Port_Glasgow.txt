     Statistical Account

Glasfow is a very healthy place.  It has no distempers
peculiar to it, and it has frequently been remarked, that
the wetter the weather is, the healthier the inhabitants are.

   Coast.-The shore, as far as the parish extends, is flat
and sandy, with some loose stones scattered here and there,
except the spot opposite to the old house or castle of Newark,
which stands upon a prominent part of the land; where the
shore, for about 150 yards, is very steep, being almost up-
on the brink of the deepest part of the river, or the Channel,
as they call it.  The common Sea-weed is cast ashore in
this parish; and though the water, in which it grows, be
only brakish, or half salt and half fresh, yet it is said to be
very good manure, at least, for one crop.  The farmers
here, however, pay little attention to it.  This neglect
seems to be owing to two circumstances; the one is, that
the farmers depend chiefly upon the produce of their cows
for the payment of their rents; and the other is, that all
the farms are situated in the mountainous part of the parish,
which renders access to them, from the shore with carriages,
very difficult and expensive.

   River, Fish, and Birds.-The river Clyde, opposite to
this parish, is supposed to be about two miles broad, but it
is only a small part of it that is navigable by vessels of bur-
den.  This part, commonly called the Channel, lies along the
New Port-Glasgow shore, is about 200 yards broad at an
average, and is every where so deep at high water, that the
largest vessels, which enter the frith of Clyde, can easily be
moored in the harbour, without discharging any part of
their cargo.  The tide rises here about 9 feet at an average.
There are some small cod and haddocks in the river, oppo-
site to this parish, but they are not in such quantities as to
render it worth any one's while to make a trade of fishing.
