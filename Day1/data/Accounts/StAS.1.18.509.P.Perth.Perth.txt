as to make public the particulars of the evidence on which the
story is confuted.
   Sir Robert Sibbald was much perplexed, in his treatise on
"the Roman ports on the south side of the Tay."  He found
evidence that the Romans had a station, or colonial town at
Perth.  But he had not taken the opportunities of fully con-
futing what Boece had said.  Therefore, he supposes, that
when Bertha was destroyed, the new town of Perth was built
where the ruins of the old Roman station were.
   But it would have been better to have had recourse to his
favourite hypothesis of the winter and summer camps; and to
have supposed, that the station in the parish of Redgorton, 2
miles above Perth, had been the summer camp, and an ap-
pendage of the colonial town.
   I beg leave just to observe, that the kingdom was divided
into parishes long before the time of King William the Lion.
Malcolm Canmore gave, and afterwards his successors con-
firmed, to the abbey of Dumfermling, the church and parso-
nage tithes of the town and parish of Perth.  I have seen the
old chartulary of that abbey.  The abbot and Monks conti-
nued to receive the tithes, and to regulate what concerned the
church of Perth; but they never had any thing to do with
the church and tithes of the parish of Redgorton.

     SS7.  Boundaries and Extent of the Parish.

   Excepting a part of the ground west from the town, where
there is an encroachment from the parish of Tibbermuir, the
parish of Perth bears, in its figure, some resemblance to a
semi-circle; the river of Tay, on the east, forming the dia-
meter.  The length, from south to north, is about 4 miles;
and the greatest breadth, from east to west, is about 3 miles.
The town is situated nearer to the north, than to the other
extremity of the parish.
