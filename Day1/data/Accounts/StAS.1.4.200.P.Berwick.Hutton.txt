   Miscellaneous Observations.-The style of living among
the poor people here, is very different from that in Eng-
land; and the earnings of the women, added of those of
the men, make a more considerable sum than that stated
in the account of the poor in England; and hence the in-
dustrous and economical among them, bring up their fa-
milies, when in health, very decently, without any assist-
ance from the parish funds.  The people are all of the or-
dinary size, except the parish schoolmaster, who is com-
puted to be 7 feet 4 inches high; his trunk is very large,
his legs long, but not well made; there appears a weak-
ness in them, and in his knee joints, so that he walks
badly.  He is very unwiedly, looks unhealthy, and is only
25 years of age.  He is very gentle in his manners, good
humoured, and obliging.  He teaches Latin, mathematics,
arithmetic, writing, and English, very well; has a very
numerous school, above 60 scholars, and gives very gene-
ral satisfaction.-The people are in general very sober, in-
dustrous, and economical.  There is a most material change
