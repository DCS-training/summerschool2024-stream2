'JAMES SINCLAIR of Dunbeath, is made so broad, that 3
'horses can conveniently ride it abreast.  A little to the east
'of the Burn of the Ord, which is the march, there is a
'pleasant green moat, called the Dunglass, as high as the
'top of the rock.  Since the heath was burnt, passengers,
'who observe, may see the vestiges of a ditch, digged up
'from the morasses, about a mile above the top of the fore-
'said rock.  The top of the Ord is large 9 miles, of bad
'road, to the south-west of the church.'
