tion by the Land's End, or the Pentland Frith.  A navi-
gable canal betwixt the Forth and Clyde, was first propo-
sed by Charles II. for small ships of war; but the expence
appearing too great for the finances of the kingdom at that
period, the design was laid aside.  It was again revived in
1723, when a survey was taken by a Mr Gordon; but no-
thing was done in consequence of it, until the year 1762,
when the then Lord NAPIER, at his own expence, employed
Mr Robert Mackell to make a survey and estimate of a Ca-
nal, which should leave the river Clyde at Yocker Burn, a-
bout five miles below Glasgow, and join the Forth within 
about two miles from the mouth of the river Carron.  In-
duced by Mr Mackell's favourable report, the Board of
Trustees, for the encouragement of fisheries and manufac-
tures in Scotland, employed the late Mr Smeaton to make
another survey and estimate for a canal, 5 feet deep, which
was to cost L. 80,000; an expenditure, it was feared, too
great for the trade which was likely to pass through it.
   In 1766, a number of respectable merchants in Glasgow,
seeing there was little probability of the scheme being ta-

canal, 4 feet deep, and 24 feet wide, estimated at L. 30,000;
and a subscription for this purpose was soon filled up.  But
when the bill was brought into Parliament, it was opposed
on several accounts, the principal of which were, the small-
ness of the scale, and the little utility which the country in
general would derive, from any vessels which it could pos-
sibly admit; and also that, if the proprietors of this canal
should once obtain a right to the water, it would for ever
preclude the possibility of making one of larger dimen-
sions.  The bill being thus lost in the House of Commons,
a number of noblemen and gentlemen began a subscription
at London, for uniting the two seas by a canal seven feet
deep, and the next year they obtained the sanction of Par-
