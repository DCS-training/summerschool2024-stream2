   KIRKPATRICK-Irongray, is one of the 10 parishes in the
Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, lying E. of the water
of Urr, and within the presbytery and Synod of Dumfries.
It is bounded on the E. within 2 miles of dumfries,  by the
parish of Terregles, which is also its limit for a good way
on the S.  On the same quarter likewise, it is diveded from
Lochrutton, by some miles of a dead running body of
water, called the Bogrie-lane.  The parishes of Urr, Kirk-
patrick-Durham, and Holywood, terminate Irongray in

The parish is computed to be about 9 miles long, and

breadth almost the whole way to the W. and may be about
3 miles broad  at the centre.  The soil is generally dry,
consisting of a kindly  mouldm not very deep, mixed with
