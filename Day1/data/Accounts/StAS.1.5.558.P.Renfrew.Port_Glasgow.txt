serves notice.  Immediately before you is the river Clyde,
having all the appearance of a fresh water lake, as the out-
let to the sea is not visible, with numbers of large and small
vessels sailing upon it.  Next to this, the opposite coast of
Dunbarton and Argyle shires, abounding in gentlemens
seats, meets the eye; and the prospect is terminated by
the western range of the Grampian mountains, at unequal
distances, and so ragged and craggy on the tops, that, by
way of contradition, they are known here by the empha-
tical name of the Duke of Argyle's Bowling Green.-In
this town there are no fewer than 81 houses which have
a licence for selling ale and spirituous liquors, besides several
others which deal clandestinely in these articles without any
licence at all.  This is no very favourable symptom of the
sobriety of the place, when so many venders of ale and spi-
rits can make a living by their trade.
   The old Scotch dialect is spoken in this town, especially
by the common people, and is pronounced by many of
them with a good deal of the Gaelic accent, owing, it
is supposed, to their intercourse with Highlanders, of whom
great numbers resort occasionally to this place, and not a
few settle in it.
