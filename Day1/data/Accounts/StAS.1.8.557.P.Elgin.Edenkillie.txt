in the present Earl's possession.  Whence the great difference
in modern times can arise, it is not easy to explain; unless from
the superior skill and industry of the fishermen nearer the sea,
which prevents so great a number now getting up the river.
Above the Sluie Pool, the channel of the river is so rocky,
that boats and draught nets cannot be used; and the fishers are
obliged to use hang nets, and other devices of that kind.
Among the rocks, long iron hooks, here called clips, are used
for catching the fish.  So considerable is the number caught
by these devices, and by the rod, that the price of salmon,
during summer, is sometimes so low as three halfpence per
pound, and seldom above twopence.-Salmon are also some-
times caught in the Divie; and both rivers afford excellent
sea trouts and finnocks, and a variety of other trouts of infe-

are very extensive.  The banks of the river are in general
covered with trees.  Along the west bank of the Findhorn,
the ancient forest of Darnway, or Ternway, already mention-

of ground, and consisting of oaks, ashes, elms, birches, allers,
hollies, mountain ashes, and a few venerable Scotch firs; with
beeches, geen trees, poplars, and almost every kind of tree
produced in Scotland.  Among these the weeping birch makes
a distinguished figure; many of them being so large as 9 feet
in girth.  Some of the oaks, at the side of the Findhorn, are
upwards of 10 feet in girth, at 3 feet from the ground.  They
are fresh vigorous trees, without the smallest appearance of
decay.  Farther up the river, is the wood of Dunduff, which
is of considerable extent, and likewise the property of Lord
Moray.  And there is also a good deal of natural wood upon
the estates of the other proprietors.  But the plantations in
