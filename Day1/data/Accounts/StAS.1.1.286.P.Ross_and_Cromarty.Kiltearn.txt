     Statistical Account

Balcony, there is a licensed distillery for aquavitae or whisky,
which pay L. 30, and consumes about 180 bolls of barley
yearly; but it is much to be regretted that a great quantity
of spirits, beside the whole produce of this distillery, is con-
sumed within the parish.  On the opposite side of the river,
and close to the New Bridge, is Culcairn Bleachfield, the
only one in the country.  This bleachfield was first esta-
blished by the late John Munro, Esq; of Culcairn, father of
the present proprietor of that name, in 1751.  Though it
promised well for several years, yet it afterwards declined
much, while it passed through the hands of different mana-
gers.  In the year 1779, it fortunately fell into the hands
of the present manager, William Tait, from Salton Bleach-
field in East Lothian.  The proprietor, observing that Mr
Tait was not deficient, either in skill or activity, resolved to
give him every encouragement, granted him a lease of the 
bleachfield, and a built a comfortable house for him.  A clear
proof of the rapid progress this field has made under the
present manager is, that, in the year 1779, there were only
440 pieces of cloth bleached here; but, in the year 1790,
the number of pieces amounted to 2242.  The Honourable
Board of Trustees, being well informed of Mr Tait's indus-
try and success, were pleased, in 1786, to grant L. 50 for
erecting a drying house.  And it is not doubted that, on a
proper representation, they will give some further aid to-
wards setting up proper machinery, and a complete bleaching
apparatus, at this very flourishing field.

   Inns and Ale-houses.-There are only two licensed ale-hou-
ses in the parish which pay excite-duty; one at Drummond,
and the other at Wester Fowlis.  These are necessary for the
accommodation of travellers, and for transacting country
business.  But these are a number of blind whisky houses,
