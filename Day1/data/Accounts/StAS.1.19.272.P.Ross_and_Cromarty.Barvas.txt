   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are neither moles,
frogs, foxes, or weasels, in the parish, nor any hares, till of
late a few made their appearance from a breed introduced
into the island by Seaforth.  It abounds with pidgeon, plo-
ver, snipe, and a vast variety of wild-geese and ducks.  The
swan, woodcock and green plover, appear in their season.
The coast abounds with a variety of sea-fowls.  Eagles,
corbies and crows, are numerous, and often prove destruc-
tive to the young lambs.  The greatest disadvantage this
parish lies under, is, the want of roads and bridges.  From
this side of the island to the village of Stornoway is rec-
koned from 12 to 18 miles of a broken swampy moor,
without so much as the form of a road across this long and
fatiguing space; the poor people are under the necessity of
carrying every article almost, to and from Stornoway, upon
their backs.  Colonel Mackenzie, who is very eager to re-
medy this evil, has, for a few years back, begun a road to
open a communication betwixt both sides of the island, and
carried it forward about five miles at a great expence.  In
place of the statute-labour, every man, from 16 to 60 years
of age, pays 1 s. 6 d.  There is only one annual fair for
selling cattle held in this whole island, consequently the
sellers are under the necessity of disposing of them at that
time, having no chance of seeing any other buyer during
that season, except for such fat cattle as are purchased by
the Stornoway merchants.  Until there be a comfortable
communication opened betwixt both sides of the island;
until the breed of cattle of every kind be improved, and
some mode contrived for a better market for them; this
parish must labour under great disadvantages.  On the
other hand, it is no small advantage, in such a high and cold
