nock, and Auchinleck.  There is no limestone in the pa-
rish, that can be advantageously wrought, but it is brought
from the neighbouring parishes.-There is some marle,
though not of the best kind.

   Roads.-The parish might be much more improved, were

the roads, and to the funds allotted for that purpose, there
being L. 60 annualy collected, of which L. 20 goes to the
repair of the toll road to Ayr.  The rest is otherwise applied,

parish.

   Proprietors, Rent, Church, etc.-The proprietors are ten

fifths of the whole parish.  On her estate there is an old
mansion house, sitauted at the east end of the village of O-
chiltree, which is the present residence of the minister, the

L. 3000 Sterling and upwards.  There is a good new church
built about three years ago.  The present incumbent was
settled in April last.  The stipend, on an average, is about
L. 95 Sterling.  The right of patronage is vested in the
Countess Dowager of Glencairn.  The school is the vil-

Ochiltree, opposite to the old house of Auchinleck, which formerly was
the seat of the proprietor of the Ochiltree estae.  And there is an old
square tower, in the south part of the parish, named Auchenclough.
