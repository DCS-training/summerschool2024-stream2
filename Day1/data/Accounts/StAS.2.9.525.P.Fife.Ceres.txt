and about twelve of land. The house is still standing in which
he was received on his descent.
     Eminent Persons.-Lindsay of Pitscottie, author of an enter-
taining history of Scotland, was a native of the parish of Ceres,
and proprietor of a small estate in it.
     Thomas Buchanan, rector of Ceres, who lived immediately after
the Reformation, was a man of considerable abilities, and of great
influence in the church.
     Mr Thomas Haliburton, minister of Ceres, and afterwards Pro-
fessor of Divinity at St Andrews, was esteemed both as a divine
and as a scholar, and wrote several pious and learned treatises.
   Modern Buildings.-Since the date of the last Statistical Ac-
bount, there have been built two uncommonly good mansion-houses
on the properties of Teasses and Edenwood. The one on the for-
mer property is built so as to command a splendid view of the Frith
of Forth.

                         III.-POPULATION.
                      In 1755, the population was       2540
                         1793,                          2320
                         1811,                          2407
                         1821,                          2840
                         1831,                          2762
Number of families in the parish,                                       606
                   chiefly employed in agriculture,                     183
                                   trade, manufactures, or handicraft,  281

     Since 1831, there has been a great increase in the number of
the people; and, from the accounts of their establishments, which
were lately given in by the several manufacturers in the parish, we
are authorized to say, that the population must now be about 3000
at least. In 1793, 138 looms are said to have been employed in
the parish. From 700 to 900 of the inhabitants are now emploved
in weaving and winding. From 170 to 200 are employed regularly
in the mills; and, with the exception of about 30, whQ are employ-
ed in the lime-works, the greater part which remains of the work-
ing population is agricultural. The town of Cupar is so near to
Ceres, that there are few shopkeepers or venders of any commodi-
ties in the latter place.
     Character and Habits of the People.-The people are univer-
sally industrious, and in general they cultivate the sister virtues
of temperance and frugality. Considerable attention to neat-
ness and cleanliness also may be discovered among them. Dr Ar-
lot, author of the former account, mentions, that among the wo-
men, the cloak and bonnet had become substitutes for the plaid;
and among the men, that the bonnet was supplanted by the hat.
