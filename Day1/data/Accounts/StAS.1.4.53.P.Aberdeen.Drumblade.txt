and oxen at L. 16; but the common prices are greatly be-
low these sums, ordinary cows selling from L. 4 to L. 5,
and oxen from L. 6 to L. 10.

   Minerals.-There is plenty of coarse lime-stone, of free-
stone, (called here paisy-whin,) of moorstone, and indica-
tions of slate; there being inexhaustible quarries of that
article in the neighbourhood.  Some few chalybeate springs
are to be met with, but weak and little used.

   Population.-According to the returns made from hence
to Dr Webster, the number of inhabitants in this parish
about 1750, was 1125; this has since diminished, as in
1790 there were only 886 individuals, of whom 427 were
males, and 459 were females.  Of the total number, 812
belonged to the Established Church; 40 were Seceders;
30 of the Episcopal persuasion , and 4 Papists.  The annual
average of births is 23 1/6; of deaths 20 2/36;  and of mar-
riages 4 4/6.  The population in 1782, was 876; in 1783,
892; in 1784, 887; in 1786, 914; in 1787, 903; in 1788,
874.  The causes of these alterations are young men, such
as masons, shoemakers, wrights, slaters, etc. going abroad
to improve themselves in their respective crafts; and to
the enlisting of some in the army, particularly in the artil-
lery.  There are 200 inhabited houses; the property of
which is divided among four heritors, only one of whom
resides.

   Productions, etc.-The parish produces all the ordinary
kinds of vegetables in the fields and gardens; supplies itself
with provisions, and exports meal, bear, and oats.  Sowing
and reaping depend much upon the seasons.  Pease and
oats are sown (if the ground be dry and fit for the seed)
from the 1st of March to the middle of April; barley and
