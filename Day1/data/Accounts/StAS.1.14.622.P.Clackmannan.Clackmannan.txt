bout the year 1763.  The cherry and splint seams began
to be wrought about 30 years ago, and are working at the
present time.  The coal Mozey seam is also working at
present: it was begun in 1972; previous to that period,
it could not be wrought to any advantage. In this coal
work, the method called the long way, is now introduced;
that is, no part of the coal is left for pillars, but the whole
taken out, which saves a great part of the coal.  In some
of the pits, the coal is brought to the top by women
and boys; and in others , by means of machinery.  The
coal is kept dry by means of an engine driven by water;
which is much less expensive than a fire engine.  The
price of coal varies according to the demand.  In general,
the price of great coal upon the hill is 5 s. the ton; of
chows, 4 s.  About 7000 tons are annually exported to
Leith, Dunbar, Perth, Dundee, Montrose, and other places.
These are taken to the harbour in wagons of a ton and
a half: the mean distance from the pits being about three
quarters of a mile*.
   The working of the Sauchy coal is of a very old date.
It is kept dry by a very powerful fire engine.  It consists
of 4 seams: the first, or uppermost, is 3 feet thick; the
second is 5 feet; But this one has no roof, so that it has
never been wrought:  the third is 5 feet, and is an excel-
lent coal:  the fourth is 9 feet:  This last, however, is 16
sathoms below the bottom of the present engine pit, which
is 47 sathoms deep.  Previous to this period, a great part
of the Sauchy coal has been exported; but as it is now in
the possesion of the Devon Company, it is highly pro-
