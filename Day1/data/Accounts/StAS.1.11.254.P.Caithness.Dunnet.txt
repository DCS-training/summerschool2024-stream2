some are beginning to be sensible, and are substituting 3 cattle
a-breast, instead of 4; endeavouring to get these of a better
quality.  The great loss this parish sustains, in respect of
agriculture, is from the scarcity of grass and provender; a
defect that can never be supplied, till the inhabitants see the
propriety of cultivating artificial grass, and green crops.  Nor
would it be difficult to persuade them of the advantage of
these, were it not for their rooted prejudice against winter
herding.  So far as they are not prevented by that preju-
dice, they are beginning to aspire to the making of small
inclosures about their houses, and sowing them with clover
and rye-grass.  Twenty years ago, there were not above 15
carts in the parish; and now there are more than 4 times that
number.  Progress in improvement, however, must be flow,
while the farms are so small, and such a number of wretched
labouring cattle kept upon them.

   Black Cattle, Horses and Sheeps.-As the parish is not well
supplied with pasture, few cows can be kept by the farmers,
and hence there is seldom any cattle reared for exportation.
A supply of horses from Orkney is needed annually.  By the
way, the greater part of Caithness, excepting the Highland
parishes of Latheron, Halkirk, and Reay, is supplied with
horses from Orkney; and yet, what may appear strange very
few breeding mares are kept in that county.  They annually
import several hundred colts, of 1 or 2 years old, from Strath-
naver and the high lands of Caithness, and export their own
horses to Caithness, about the age of 6 or 8 years.  That
plan they follow so regularly, that, in some parts of Orkney,
a dead horse is thought a curiosty.  Unhappily that is not
the cafe in Caithness, and particularly in the parish of Dun-.
net, where numbers every year fall a sacrifice to age and po-
verty.  The greater part of the horses, imported from Ork-
