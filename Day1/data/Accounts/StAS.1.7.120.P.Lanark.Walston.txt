including communion elements.  The glebe is one of the
worst in the country; and it ought to be, observed, that mi-
nisters glebes, in general, are of less advantage to them than
many people are apt to imagine, as they oblige them to keep
more servants than the produce of them can maintain.  To
remedy this, as much land contiguous to the glebe, as, toge-
ther with the glebe, would be sufficient work for a man and
two horses, should always be allotted to the minister at a mo-

   Number of Poor, Parochial Funds, Etc.-The money paid
to the poor for 40 years past, amounts, on an average, to 18 L.
Sterling per annum, as appears by written records.  The an-

arising from the interest of 2000 merks mortified for their
use many years ago, from money received for the use of
mortcloths at burials, from the weekly collections that are
made in the church, etc. is about 10 L. Sterling.  The defi-

40 years back, one often meets with 13 or 14 persons upon
it.  The relief afforded to the poor is always in their own
cottages.  Convinced that begging from door to door is an
inlet to numberless evils, many people are endeavouring to
suppress it as much as possible.  It may be remarked, that in
those parishes where an assessment is laid upon the heritors
and their tenants to supply the deficiency of the parish funds,
the poor are much less scrupulous in applying for parish sup-
port, than in those parishes where they are supplied by the
session, solely from the parish funds.  Where this last is the
case, the poor are less importunate, and more backward to
apply for parish support, and more thankful when they re-
