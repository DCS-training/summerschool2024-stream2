airtney, between 200 and 300; of goats, about 100.  The
sheep are of the black faced kind, and on most of the farms
are every year improving.  The small Highland breed,
once very numerous here, is now almost entirely banished.
The hill horses too, to make room for the sheep, are reduced
to a very small number.  The smeared or tarry wool, is fold
at from 4 s. to 5 s. per stone; the white wool at 7 s. 6 d. -There
are in the parish hares, rabbits, foxes, martins, partridges,
grouse, and a few ptarmigans and heath fowl.

   Produce, etc.-The principal crops are oats and bear.  Potatoes
are planted every where in great quantities, and, with milk,
constitute the principal part of the food of the lower classes,
for 8 months of the year.  A good deal of meal is bought
from the neighbouring parishes of Monivaird, Crieff and Mu-
thil.  Those parishes also supply our small whisky stills with
about 1200 bolls of barley yearly.

   Manufacturers.-Our staple manufacturers is linen yarn, of
which a great quantity is spun and fold every year.  With the
money which this yarn brings, most of the farmers pay a great
part of their rents.  This yarn sells at about 2 s. 4 d. per
spindle.  From the tow of the lint they spin harn yarn, which
is made into cloth, that brings from 9 d. to 1 s. per yard.
The finer sort is used for men and women's shirts; the coarser
for sailors jackets and trousers.  The women make also a great
quantity of plaiden cloth, which is sold at from 10 d. to 1 s.
per yard; and a considerable quantity of tartan, of which
they make plaids and hose.  These are partly for home use,
and partly for the market.

   Prices of Labour.-The wages of servants and labourers
have risen very much within these 10 years.  Day labourers
