number of the inhabitants are tenants or cottagers.  There
are 6 weavers, 4 tailors, 2 shoemakers, 5 wrights, 6 ma-
sons, 3 smiths, and 2 millers.  All the inhabitants are of
the Established Church.  It would be unnecessary, it is pre-
sumed, to attempt to give a peculiar character of the inha-
bitants.  In every parish in which no town is situated, and
where few, people of fortune reside, the inhabitants must be

   Quantity of Acres, Rent, etc.-There is no map of the
whole parish.  The quantity of acres amounts to about

others so high as L. 200; it is believed the average is
about L. 60.  Best arable land is in general let at 15 s. the
acre; but some contiguous to the village is taken in small
quantities at double that price.  The improvement of land
in this parish and the neighbourhood has been very rapid
within these few years.  Formerly there were but few en-
closures, and the ground was in its natural state; conse-
quently, when tilled, it yielded but small returns to the
farmer, sometimes two, sometimes threefold.  Now the
land is generally enclosed, and before it is broken up, it is
improved with shells, marl, or lime.  There is some marl
in the parish, and the shells on the sea-shore seem to be in-
exhaustible.  Lime is brough from Cumberland, and sold
at 1 s. the Carlisle bushel, 50 of which are commonly laid
on an acre.  For the most part 3, sometimes 4 crops of
grain are taken from the land thus improved, with the last
