outside of the cannon is turned by proper instruments, and
the whole is not only neat, but substantial.
   At these works bar iron is also made; and in accom-
plishing that business, the following method is pursued:
   The pig iron is melted in a finery, where coke is used;
while hot, it is beaten out into plates about an inch in
thickness.  These plates are afterwards broken into pieces
about two inches square, for the convenience of scouring
them, etc.  They are then scoured in an iron cylinder,
which is connected with the water wheel, and when they
are properly prepared by this operation, they are put into
pots, which are made of fire clay, and in an air-furnace
they are brought to a welding heat; in this state of pre-
paration they are put under the hammer, and wrought into
blooms; the blooms are heated in a chafery, or hollow
fire,-and then drawn into bars for various uses.  In this
condition the iron is equal in goodness to that which is im-
ported from Ruffia under the name of new sable iron.
   The machinery is moved by the water of the river Car-
ron, and for a supply in time of drought, they have a re-
servoir to the extent of about 30 acres.  But as this pre-
caution is not enough in very dry seasons, they have more-
over an engine for throwing back the water that it may be
used again, and this engine raises 4 tons every stroke, and
makes about 7 strokes in a minute.  If we take into the
account, along with the people who are directly employed
in the manufacture at Carton, those also who are engaged
in the mines and pits, together with these who carry mate-
rials to the works, and goods by sea and otherwise imme-
diately from them, we may estimate the whole at 2000
people.
   Nobody is admitted to view the works on Sundays, ex-
cept those who are properly recommended, or known to
be worthy of attention.  Mr Burns, the Ayrshire poet,
