   8. ANDREW BRUCE, Archdeacon of St Andrews, was advanced to
the Bishoprick of Dunkeld on the death of William Lindsay, and was eject-
ed in 1686, for his opposition to the measures of the Court.  In the year
following, "his Majesty's dispensation (says Keith, p. 180) was issued to
"Dr. Bruce, for exercising the office of the ministry." Mr Keith adds,
not unnaturally, "A right strange paper truly!"	 In the year 1688 he
was appointed Bishop of Orkney.

   9.JOHN HAMILTON, son to John Hamilton, who was Archbishop of
St Andrews; at the time of the Reformation. This Prelate survived the Re-
volution, and died one of the Ministers of Edinburgh, and subdean of the
Chapel Royal.

     Revolution.

     1. MR CHALMERS.
     2. MR STODART.
     3. MR. STEWART.
     4. MR. MAN
     5. DR. BAIRD.
     6. MR. NIVEN, the present incumbent

   Such is a catalogue of the Clergy, who, whether under the Romish, the
Episcopalian, or the Presbyterian establishment, have, for a period of a thou-
sand years, presided over the services of religion in Dunkeld.  The observa-
tions which accompany the names, will, it is hoped, have three effects.
They will, 1.  Illustrate the ancient dignity and influence of the See.
2.  They will enable any future editors of Abbot Mill's History of the Bi-
shops, (a work which has often been called for by the antiquarian), to cor-
rect several mistakes into which that writer has fallen.  And, lastly, They
will lead the casual traveller, as he reviews with delight the modern beau-
ties of the scene, to muse in melancholy, but not unpleasing or vain retro-
spection, over former times; times when here the Mimuers of King ? ? ?   
since fallen, sought retirement and repose; and where many a Prelate,
whose ashes now moulder around, once displayed his magnificence, exerted
his genius, and indulged his devotion.
