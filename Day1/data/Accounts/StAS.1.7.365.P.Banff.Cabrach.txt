   Church, School, and Poor.-The minister's stipend is 45 L
Sterling, and the services; besides 2 L 15 L 6 1/2 d. Sterling
for communion element money; with a glebe of 19 acres
arable, and 2 of pasture ground.  The parochial school salary'

families have been frequently observed to bring over Papists,
especially the female part, from their former persuasion.

their opportunities, and of an obliging disposition.  Notwith-
