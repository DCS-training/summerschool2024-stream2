     Statistical Account

   Population.-Whether the inhabitants of this parish were
formerly (perhaps 90 or 100 years ago) more numerous, than
at present, cannot now be well ascertained*; though the af-
firmative may fairly enough be presumed, from the general
annexation of 2, 3, or 4, farms into one, and the number of
ley farms, as they are called, because let to people living at
a distance, or not within the parish.  Of these there are 9
or 10; four of which are rented by extra parishioners.  Nor
can it but be doubtful, whether the presumeable decrease of
population, occasioned by these means, will be made up by the
accession of the new large village below the church, and 2
or 3 smaller ones near the river Crawick.  Be that as it will,
the present amount is near 800 examinable persons, and the

   Language.-That the Gaelic, or Earse, has in antient
times been the prevailing language of this part of the coun-
try, may fairly enough be concluded from the names of dif-
ferent lands in the parish; such as Crockray, Knockenjig,

<FOOTNOTE>

*Baptisms are inserted in the parish register, but neither
marriages nor deaths.  Nor can even the insertion of baptisms
be traced farther back than the year 1742.  To form a general
calculation, it may be observed, that about 20 years ago the
average number of baptisms, for 3 years, was near 13 each
year; and that the same average, for the last 3 years, was a-
bout 18.  The children of dissenters are not included, as the
parents decline taking the benefit of the register for that pur-
pose, either to avoid paying the usual small perquisite to the
clerk, or, as is supposed by most people, because it is a part
of their political etiquette, to express in this way their dread of
contagion or contamination, from even a parochial record.
Whether they keep a register of their own, or not, is more than
can at present be ascertained.
