     Statistical Account

   Grass.-Though the whole parish of Abercorn be arable,
excepting what is rendered otherwise by planting, fully two-
thirds of it are in grass.  The richest crops of grain adorn
the fields only for a few of the summer months, but when
in grass, they are covered with verdure through the whole
year.  This seems to be the reason why noblemen and gen-
tlemen do not choose to have the lands in the immediate
vicinity of their places in tillage, and accounts for so great
proportion of this parish being in grass.  At the same time,
it may be observed, that lands suitable for pasture, and
within a convenient distance of Edinburgh, are nearly of
the same value as when under the plough.  Some of the
fields are distinguished both by the quantity and richness of
the grass which they produce, and have been said by intel-
ligent graziers, though not so early, to be equal in value, in
the course of the year, to any in North Britain.  Those
let are generally employed in feeding beef and mutton for
the Edinburgh market.  They are considered as too valu-
able for breeding by those to whom profit is the only ob-
ject.

   Wood.-The natural beauty of the parish is greatly
heightened by the quantity of land which is planted, and
the taste with which it has been done.  There is at present
a considerable proportion of the whole, perhaps about a
sixth, covered with wood.  From this circumstance, Aber-
corn naturally strikes the eye from the opposite coast of
Fife.  Continued plantations, from the vicinity of Queens-
ferry to Blackness, mark the bounds of the parish, and ex-
hibit a scene rich and beautiful with belts, and those which
are extensive are ornamented with clumps of various di-
mensions.  On the highest land in the parish, formerly the
moor of Abercorn, the Earl of Hopetoun has a wood of
