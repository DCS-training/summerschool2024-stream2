manding object on the west, while on the south the city is bounded
by Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags. The oldest and most ele-
vated part of the city occupies the central ridge, the New Town
stands on the north declivity, and a modern suburb extends to the
south. Beyond this, lie the hills of Braid and the extensive range
of the Pentlands, while the west is bounded by the wooded hill of
Corstorphine. The Water of Leith, taking its rise in the Pent-
land Hills, flows to the north-west of the New Town, and dis-
charges its current into the sea at Leith.
   Meteorology.-The climate of Edinburgh partakes of the na-
ture of that of the eastern coast generally. The mean annual
fall of rain is about twenty-four inches, being nearly one-half less
than that of the western coast of Scotland. The average tempe-
rature is about 47ø Fahrenheit.

   The prevailing winds are from the west and south-west, except
in the months of March, April, and May, when an easterly wind
generally blows with very little variation. This easterly wind,
coming from the north-west continent of Europe, is cold and dry;
the west and south-west winds again, being a portion of the tropi-
cal currents, are warm and highly charged with moisture. The
months of March and April are those in which least rain falls;
while July, August, and September are usually wet months.
Thunder storms are of frequent occurrence in June, and occasion-
ally in the end of May; and invariably come from the south and
west, generally in the direction of Pentland range. In sum-
mers, when an excess of north and easterly winds takes place, there
is less thunder around Edinburgh, the collisions of the adverse and
contra-electric currents taking place more to the west and north.
   Soil.-The soil of Edinburghshire being of a light arenaceous
composition, and the subsoil porous and absorbent, together with
the undulating nature of the country, admits of a ready draining
off and evaporation of the moisture, and thus tends to keep the
atmosphere dry, and to facilitate the absorption of the sun's heat.
The city, from its peculiar situations, is very much exposed to
winds, and this joined to its altitude above the sea level, renders
