   Salmon Fishing on Spey.-The fish in Spey are, the
salmon; a trout, called here the white trout, of about
2 or 3 lb. weight, which comes in March, and continues
for some months, and is very delicate: the grilse, which
begins about the middle of June, and continues until

river from the sea.  Mr. Richardson of Perth, and Mr.
Gordon of Portsoy, have it in lease.  The fishing here be-
gins on St. Andrew's day, and ends the 26th of August.
There is seldom, however, any regular fishing until a-
bout the beginning of February.  Until about the be-

now salted for exportation, as there is a sufficient de-
mand at the London market; and the countries to which
the salted salmon was formerly sent, are now supplied
in a great measure from America.  The price of salmon
