     Statistical Account

for more than three years they have entirely left the coast.
They were always in season, except from February to May.
The cod and ling are not plentiful, and they are inferior in
quality to those taken farther north.  The mackarel and her-
rings come from beyond Fife Ness, and are principally taken
in Autumn.  All the towns of Angus afford excellent
markets for all these kinds of fish, the town of Dundee espe-
cially; but it is now poorly and irregularly supplied.  Be-
tween Monyfieth and Arbroath, considerable quantities of
crabs and lobsters are found.  The lobsters went chiefly to the
London market, till lately, that by overfishing, none were to
be had of a proper size, and, on this account they were for
some time spared, and more of them come to the market of
Dundee.  Muscles and cockles come from the mouth of the
Eden, near St. Andrews, and are sold by measure.  The defect
of our sea fishing is, that the fishermen live too far up the river,
and, their boats being smaller than in the times when smug-
gling prevailed, they do not go out to deep enough water, and
cannot always venture to cross the bar, We have no oys-
ters, and all attempts to settle them in the river, have hither-
to been unsuccessful.

   Antiquities, Curiosities, etc.-On the top of the Law of Dun-
dee, which is the most remarkable hill in the parish, there
are the remains of a fortification, the ditch of which is still
visible.  Though the whole inclosure, which is of a square
form, is not of the same structure with the towers, which
have been supposed to be cemented by the force of fire, one
small part of at has been thus compacted.  Probably on this
the fires for alarming the town were lighted; and, by the fre-
quent lighting, some of the stones have been put in fusion.
Along a good part of the shore on the estate of Craigie, seve-
ral urns of unburnt clay, containing ashes, have beers found,
