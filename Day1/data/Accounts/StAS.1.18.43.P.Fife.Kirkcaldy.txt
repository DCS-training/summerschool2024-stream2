to the community*.  In this sum all public burdens are in-
cluded; the community having become bound, when their
lands were feued, to relieve the feuars of all public burdens
in all time coming; thus leaving to posterity one incontrover-
tible proof, at least, that they once had property.
   The rest of the revenue is drawn from a port duty on goods
landed at the harbour, from the petty customs on goods inter-
changed with the neighbouring country, and from an impost of
2 pennies Scots on the pint of ale brewed in the town for sale,
or sold into it from the neighbourhood.  This last is a parlia-
mentary grant, which was fist given for a limited period, in
1707, with the burden of L. 10 annually, to the professor of
mathematics in the King's College of Aberdeen; and which
has, since that time, been again and again renewed, without
any burden.  The whole revenue produced last year L. 317+,
but it does not average above L. 260.  The ordinary purposes
to which the revenue is applied, are: 1.  The discharge of
public burdens, amounting annually to about L. 60.  2. The
payment of interest on a debt of L. 2430++.  3. The repara-
tion of the harbour, 4. The payment of clerks, officers, and
all the incidental expences incurred in conducting the busi-
ness of the community.
   The annual cess paid to government from this burgh is

*Above 400 acres of the moor were feued to the late Mr Oswald of
Dunikeer, at the yearly feu-duty of L. 45: 10.  But, in consequence of a re-
serve to the feuar, to buy up the feu-duty at least to a certain extent, at 20
years purchase, it has been lately reduced to L. 20: 18: 4; so that the whole
feu duties now payable to the town, are as above stated.
+Feu duties L. 40: 12; petty custom L 28; 10; shore-dues L. 135; im-
