     Statistical Account

   Mr Wilkie (the writer of the preceding observations) is the
person alluded to, in the Statistical Account of Scotland, vol. I.
(Parish of Kettle), page 377:  In justice to whom, it is proper
to mention, that there was a very material error of the press.
Instead of "This table, upon trial, is found to answer better
for Scotland than any yet published by Mr Wilkie," it ought
to have been printed thus:   "This table, upon trial, is found
by Mr Wilkie, to answer better for Scotland, than any yet
published."  The fact is, Mr Wilkie himself constructed that
very important table.-It may be proper to add, that in
a letter from mr Wilkie on the subject of annuities, he
communicates the following particulars, which seem to be
highly worthy of being laid before the public.-"I have
had an opportunity (says he) of forming a table of the proba-
bilities of life, for the country of Fife, from the bills of morta-
lity in the neighbouring parish of Kettle; in which the seve-
ral ages of the deceased, have been accurately recorded.-
This table, I find, differs materially from all the English table,
upon the same subject.  For example,

tion of the parish of Kettle, but with the lives of ministers and
