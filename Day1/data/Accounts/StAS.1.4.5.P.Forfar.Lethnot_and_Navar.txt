(as they are commonly called) or smelts, which are a slen-
der clear-skinned species of trout about eight or nine inch-

but their flesh is white, whereas that of the sea-trout is red-

   Distempers.-On account of our being surrounded by
high hills, we are exposed to freguent and strong gusts of
wind, by which the atmosphere is kept pure and healthy.
The distempers most prevalent are inflammatory and pleu-
risy fevers, owing to the frequent and sudden changes of
the weather, and to the people being exposed to hard exer-
cise, wet clothes, and a sudden stopping of the perspiration.
There is a distemper, called by the country-people the leap-
ing ague, and by physicians, St Vitus's dance, which has pre-
vailed occasionally for upwards of 60 years in these parishes,
and some of the neighbouring ones.  The patient first com-
plains of a pain in the bead, and in the lower part of the
back; to this succeed convulsive fits, or fits of dancing at cer-
tain periods.  This disease appears to be hereditary in some
families.  When the fit of dancing, leaping or running sei-
zes the patient, nothing tends more to abate the violence of
the disease, than the allowing him free scope to exercise
himself in this manner till nature be exhausted.  Another
distemper, with which the constitution of some families here
is tainted, is the scrofula of king's evil, owing very pro-
bably to cold, and to a poor aliment.  But in general the
climate seems favourable to longevity.  Within these last
16 years, four persons have died, who were above 90; one
of them was 106.

   Population.-Dr Webster's state of the population about 40
years ago nwas 635 souls.  The number of people has decreased
considerably within these last 20 years.  In 1777 and 1778, the
