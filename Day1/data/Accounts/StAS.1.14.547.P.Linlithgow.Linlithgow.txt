     Situation, Origin of the Name, etc.

   LINLITHGOW lies 16 miles from Edinburgh, and
gives its name to the western division of Lothian,
of which it is the chief town.  It ranks the sixth among
the Scotch boroughs, and belongs to the district in which
Lanark, Selkirk, and Peebles, are included: it is also the
seat of a presbytery.  Linlithgow is thought by antiquaries

<FOOTNOTE>

*Few parishes in Scotland would afford more ample and interesting
materials for a statistical report, than that of Linhthgow.  The author
of this, from recent admission to his charge, and ether circumstances,
has not been able to attain that degree of information which would
qualify one to do justice to a subject so complicated and extensive.  As,
however, the work, which has occupied many of his brethren, honour-
ably for themselves and usefully to the publick, now draws to a close,
he thinks himself bound, even under that disadvantage, to state some
particulars, which may lead afterwards to a more full and accurate in-
vestigation.
