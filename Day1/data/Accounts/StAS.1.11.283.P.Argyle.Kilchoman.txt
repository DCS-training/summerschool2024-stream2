     of Kilchoman.

   Church.-The church* now made use of, stands in the
middle of the parish.  The minister goes occasionally to the
skirts of it, and preaches for more than one half of the year,
in both languages; a duty which none but the clergy in the
Highlands have to go through.  He has 50 L. of stipend, a
glebe, and manse-money, with 5 L. for communion elements;
has been settled 10 years in the parish, and is married to his
predecessor's widow, by which her children drew 200 L. out of
the widow's fund.  The King is patron of all Islay, and draws
500 L. yearly feu-duty out of it.  All the inhabitants belong
to the Established Church.  There are 4 parishes, but only 3
ministers in the island, notwithstanding the great number of
the inhabitants.

   Schools.-The parochial school is taught in the church.
There are at present about 40 scholars attending it.  The
master has 100 merks of yearly salary, with dues from
christenings and marriages.  There are several other schools in
different parts of the parish; the master of which are main-
tained and paid by the contributions of individuals.  An in-
dustrious good schoolmaster is a most valuable member of so-
ciety, and much needed in this parish, to assist in guarding the
youth from the errors of Popery, as we are just in the very
neighbourhood of Ireland.  A fourth minister is also much
to be wished for in the island; as, upon some occasions, 3
clergymen have to dispense the sacrament to no fewer than
1200 communicants.

<FOOTNOTE>

*This parish is obliged to the devotion, or rather to the superstition, of its
former inhabitants, for the many vestiges of chapels, or places of worship, that
are to be seen in it; these being no less than 6 in number, whose walls, crosses,
and fonts are pretty entire.  But how could it be otherwise, with a place that
is within a few leagues of the monastery of the famous IONA, which dispersed
its missionaries all over Britain?
