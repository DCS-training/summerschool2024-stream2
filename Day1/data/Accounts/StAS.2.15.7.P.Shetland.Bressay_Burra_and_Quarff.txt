                       BRESSAY, BURRA, AND QUARFF.

                   PRESBYTERY OF LERWICK, SYNOD OF SHETLAND.

        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Situation, Boundaries, &c.-These parishes comprehend six
islands, with a part of the mainland of Shetland. One parish lies
on the east of the mainland, consisting of the islands of Bressay
and Noss, divided from each other by Noss Sound, and from
Lerwick by Bressay Sound.
   Bressay is nearly six English miles in length; its breadth varying
from two to three, or, at some points, rather more. Its aspect on
the west is somewhat diversified by indentations of the coast, the
height of its hills, the cultivated land sloping toward the sea, and
by the houses, cottages, and hamlets interspersed from south to
north. Tracks of hilly ground run through it in irregular direc-
tions, between which that sort of variety occurs, which is formed
by the intermixture of pasture and peat moss.
   Noss is two miles long, and a mile or more in breadth, having
an acclivity from west to east. The greater part of it is pasture
ground ; but in the lower part, there is enough of cultivation to
form a comparatively large and good farm.
   Topographical Appearances.-The most prominent object in
Bressa is the Ward or Beacon Hill near the south extremity,
which rises 724 feet above the level of the sea, somewhat coni-
cally shaped ; and, being covered with heath, stunted grass, and
peat-moss, it has a very sombre aspect. St Andrew's or Ander
Hill, on the east side of the island, is a hilly ridge, 400 feet or
more in height.
   Some caverns occur along the coast, one of which, on the south.
part, is the most remarkable, and has never been thoroughly ex-
