     NUMBER XXXV.

     PARISH OF EDENKEILLIE.

     (Presbytery of Forres-Synod and County of Moray.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JOHN MACDONNEL, lately Minister of that
     Parish, now Minister of FORRES.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE name of the parish is clearly of Gaelic origin;
Aodincoillie signifying the face of the wood.  It is des-
criptive of the nature of the parish, which contained two
royal forests, Ternway, or Darnway, anti Drummine.  In
the public records there is preserved a charter, by King David
Bruce, granting to RICHARD COMYNE, a predecessor of Cumming
of Altyre, an heritor in this parish, the office of forester of the
king's forest of Ternway, in the earldom of Moray.  And there
is an after grant, in 1478, to THOMAS CUMMYNE of Alter, of
the office of forester of the forest of Drummyne.  The remains
of natural wood, and the great quantities of oak and fir, found.
in the mosses of this parish, prove that the whole face of the
country was formerly covered with wood.  The names of
many of the places in the parish, shew, what indeed might
naturally be supposed, that it once abounded with deer.  Drum-
