nion.  Some farmers think them an advantage to the crops,
as in hot dry summers they keep the ground moist and cool,
and in winter warm.  Vast quantities have been gathered,
which, in labouring, proves a great ease both to the plough
and the ploughman.  The haughs, near the Dovan, present
a deep loam mixed with sand, and the soil is very different
from that of the crosts.  The farm of Gutters is in part clay,
and bears fine crops of wheat as well as other grains.  The
lands south of the Doran are much inferior to those on the
north side.  In some places, the soil is a clay, of a cold na-
ture; in others it is a light loam, mixed with sand and gra-
vel, on a till bottom, and in others it is a deep rich loam.  A
considerable part of the ground is covered with heath, and
would not be easily improved, either for tillage or pasture.
Perhaps the best improvement would be, to enclose the
moors, and to plant them with Scotch firs, larches, and o-
ther forest trees.

   Agriculture.-In the county of Clackmanan, agricultural
improvements are much attended to, and have been brought
to great perfection.  Richer crops of wheat, barley, or hay,
are seldom to be met with; and the ploughs used, and the
mode of ploughing, are no where surpassed.  A plough and
ploughman were sent this summer from Clackmannanshire to
Windsor, to give a proper specimen of plowing on his Ma-
jesty's farm.

   Crops and Multures, etc.-The farmers in Tillicoultry
do not pretend to take any lead in agricultural improvement.
They profit, however, by the observations and the practice
of others.  Two horse ploughs are getting into general use,
which are a great improvement in husbandry.  The crops
