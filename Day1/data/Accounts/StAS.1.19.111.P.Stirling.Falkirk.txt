   From these different stones it appears, that the wall was
chiefly made by the 2d and 20th legions, and the vexilla-
tions of the 6th and 20th, together with a cohort of auxil-
liaries*.  Every 1000th part of a legion was called a cen-
tury, and had a vexillum, or pair of colours.  To guard
these, ten of the best soldiers were allotted for each vexil-
lum, and those guards, which in every legion amounted to
1000 men, were called its vexillation.
   This rampart is denominated by Buchanan, in his Hi-
story of Scotland, the wall of Severus.  Other writers have
also given it the same name; but though it may have been
repaired by Severus, as it was by different people, yet the
wall which he built was not in this district of the country,
but was drawn between the Solway frith and Newcastle,
nearly in the same direction in which Adrian had formerly
built his.
   The wall of Antoninus is generally known in this coun-
try by the name of Graham's Dike.  Some are of opinion,
that it derived this name from a powerful leader of that
name, who broke through this famous line of defence, and
routed the Britons on the south side of it, who were then
abandoned by the Romans.  Others affirm, that in the
reign of Malcom II. one Gryme, who was connected with
the royal family, aspiring to the throne, drew together
some followers, and in order to settle the commotion, the
pretender got a grant for the term of his life of all that
part of Malcolm's kingdom which was on the north side of
the wall, and that the line of separation was from this event
called Gryme's Dike; hence, by an easy transition, Gra-
ham's Dike.  It has also been suggested, that as the build-
ing of this wall has been attributed to Severus, so by trans-
lating Severus into English, you have Grim; and in a
