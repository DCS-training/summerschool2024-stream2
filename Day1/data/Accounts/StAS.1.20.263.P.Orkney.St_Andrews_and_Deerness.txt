the bay.  Deer Sound lies nearly north-east and south-west;
it is about five miles long from the Mull-head, where it be-
gins to open; and from one to two and a half miles broad.
Being much land-locked, and good clean sandy ground mix-
ed with clay, the greatest fleets can lie safely in it.  The pro-
per anchoring ground is three miles and a half within the
Mull-head, three-fourths of a mile within the point of Ness,
and about one-half mile from each shore, in about four fa-
thoms water.  It is not much frequented, except by a few
ships bound for Davis's Straits, and those that go to Ice-
land.  They engage some of their men here.  Some years
ago, the Iceland fishing sloops amounted to about 20 or 30,
mostly from England.  They hired many of their fishing
hands here, and on their return, bought from the people
fresh provisions, feathers, stockings, gloves, linen, and white
worsted stuffs, &c.  This fishing gradually declined till about
three years ago, when only four vessels came; and three of
these were taken by the French, and the sailors carried pri-
soners to France, from whence many of them never return-
ed.  The year after, no British fishermen ventured there;
and for these last two years, there has gone only one vessel.

   Fish and Fowl.-Deerness is conveniently situated for
fish.  The country people go out in boats, and catch coal-
fish in numbers; they get some cod, skate, haddocks,
hallibut, dog-fish, and a very few ling.  The people of St
Andrews get skate in Stronsay Frith; and in Deer Sound,
coal-fish, vast numbers of small cockles, and some oysters.
On the sand and shores of Deerness are seen miriads of plo-
vers, curlews, sea-larks, sea-pies, and a large grey bird with
a hoarse cry, called by the inhabitants Horra Goose.  These
appear only in spring, in flocks of about 200, but do not
continue long; and the lofty rocks of Copinshay are cover-
ed with wild-fowl of various kinds, without name, and
