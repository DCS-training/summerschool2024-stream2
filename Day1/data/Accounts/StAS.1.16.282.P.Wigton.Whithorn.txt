     Statistical Account

   Good dwelling-houses, and office-houses upon farms, add
much to the appearance of a country; and sure no set of
men deserve good lodgings more than farmers do.  In
this parish these have improved very much within the last
twenty years.  They are often covered with slate, and di-
vided into convenient apartments.  Sheds and straw-
yards are coming into general use.

   Air.-Here the air is dry and healthy, and I never heard
that any disease became epidemic.

   Course of Crops.-The land being covered with lime,
marl, or sea-shells, is opened with beer (big), or oats, and
three crops of these succeed each other.  With the last is
sown rye-grass and clover seeds, which is cut in the sum-
mer after the grain has been reaped.  This hay-crop, as
the rye-grass generally prevails, is almost as severe upon
the land as oats.

   Increase and Weight of Grain.-The average increase of
beer, is about eight-fold, and of oats about five-fold.  Bar-
ley weighs about 52 lb. bear, 46 lb. and oats, 36 lb. avoir-
dupois, the Winchester bushel.

   Coast; Head-lands and Bays.-The extent of coast is
about nine miles.  The shore near Burgh Head is bold, and
everywhere rocky.  At this headland a lighthouse would
be of the greatest use to the trade in those parts.  Beside
the headland now mentioned, there are Port-Yarrock Head
and Stun Head; and the bays are those of Port Allan,
Port Yarrock, and Isle of Whithorn.

   Tides.-From Port Yarrock round Burgh Head, the
tide flows close along the shore three hours, and ebbs nine.
