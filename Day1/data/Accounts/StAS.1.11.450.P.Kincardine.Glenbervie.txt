of the inhabitants*.  The cultivation of turnips likewise en-
gages the attention of the farmer now; and he always finds
them a profitable crop, if properly managed.  For the know-
ledge, however, of this, and indeed of improvements in ge-
neral, this county and neighbourhood are principally, if not
altogether, indebted to Mr. BARCLAY of Urie, whose exer-
tions in agriculture have been very great, and attended with
success.  The climate here is rather cold than otherwise, but
healthy; and the harvest is early or late according to the sea-
son, the nature of the soil, and the situation of the ground.
There are 53 ploughs in the parish.

*In 1782, however, which was a very remarkable year here, the crop was
very deficient, and the poor reduced to great distress.  The ground did not
produce so much grain as would have maintained the inhabitants 6 months.  In
that and the following year, the kirk-session were obliged to apply nearly 140 l.
Sterling of their funds, in purchasing white pease and barley, in order to preserve
the poor from suffering by, want, and to relieve the necessities of other inha-
bitants.
