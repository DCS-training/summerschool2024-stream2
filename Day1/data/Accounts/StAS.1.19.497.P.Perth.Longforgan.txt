rollers, or broken in a mill, it will be found by experience,
that much less will nourish, and even fatten pigs, as well as
all animals of every species usually fed upon corn.  There-
fore, to breed pigs about a farm, and to feed all bestial upon
bruised grain, instead of whole corn, are really great im-
provements in agricultural economy; but the practice is
not general here; and the country people still retain some
prejudice against pork; but it is wearing out gradually.

   Poultry.-Poultry of all kinds are bred in this parish,
turkeys, geese, ducks, hens, etc.; but the fowls are certainly
much fewer in number since the practice of letting large
farms began.  All the small farmers, acre-men, and every
village-house, formerly paid so many fowls (kain) as a part
of their rent, which was a mean of keeping up the breed,
not only for the supply of the country round, but also to
answer the demand of the market-towns in the neighbour-
hood.  Now, the villagers pay none, as it was a constant
cause of dispute with the farmers, and even amongst them-
selves.  However, most of the great farmers pay kain, al-
though they are very averse to the practice.  But the land-
lords insist upon it, as the only means of preserving the
breed from total extinction; at the same time, many far-
mers throw the burden upon their cottars, and make them
pay the kain as part of their house-rent.  In all old leases it
made a part of the agreement, that so many capons should
be paid annually, as part of the kain, and then they were in
plenty; but as they have not been exacted for some time
now there is scarce capon to be found in the country.

   Pigeons.-There are eight dove-cots, or pigeon-houses, in
the parish.  The pigeons are exceedingly fine; but they re
a very expensive delicacy to the farmer; yet they are of
some advantage, for their dung, either mixed with chaff, or
not, and sown upon the surface, and either harrowed in with
