   Antiquities.-The site of the Clyde Iron-works seems to have
been a burying-ground of ancient date.  When digging the founda-
tion of the buildings, great quantities of human bones were found
deposited-betwixt flat-stones.  These stones were so placed, as to
form a cavity of considerable extent, which was covered with a
stone of lhe same sort.  Various earthern urns were found, con=
taining ashes mixed with human bones, on some of which were
evident marks of fire.  In 1834, when Mr Bowmen, a distinguished
breeder of cattle, was clearing out a plantation on a gravelly hill
near Blair-tummock, two urns, perfectly smooth and of a reddish
colour, were discovered.  On the Camp farm, near Bailliestone, in
casting drains, pieces of horse harness, apparently of ancient date,
are frequently turned up.

                        III.-POPULATION.
   The population of this parish in 1755 was only 1813. in 1831
it was 9580.  In 1791, the population was 4000, which, since
1755, in makes an increase of 2187 in thirty-six years, which is the
rate of upwards of 60 per annum.  In 1801, the population, was
4006, which was only 6 of an increse in ten years. In 1811, the
population was 5469, which is an increase of 1463 in ten years, or
at the rate of upwards of 146 per annum.  In 1821, the popula-
lation was 6983, which is an increase of 1414 in ten years, or at
the rate of upwards of 141 per annum.  The population in 1831
was 9580, which is an increase of 2597 in ten years, which was at
the rate of 259 per annum.  The anunual increase at present is at
least double that amount.  The increase between 1755 and 1791,
as stated in the last report, was "entirely owing to the establish-
ment of manufacturers."  These seem to have been nearly in a sta-
tionary state from that period till I811.  From that date the coal
and iron trade have been continually advancing, and at the present
moment the parish of Old Monkland is the principal seat of the
iron manufacture in Scotland.  In 1831 there were
