is now in a very mean and almost ruinous state.  The wall
stood almost entire till 1781, when the garden being feued
off for building upon, by the late Earl of Abercorn, the wall
was sold to the feuers, and the stones of it employed in their
houses.

   Poor.-The poor of the parish are numerous, a necessary
consequence of the extensive manufactures, and of the ready
employment afforded to labourer, of every description.  In
1776-77-78, the sum expended for the relief of the poor
amounted, on an average, to 71 l. 11 s. yearly.  In 1779-80-
81, to 85 l. 7 s. In 1782-83-84, to 136 l. 12 s. In 1785-
86-87, to 238 l. 3 s. In 1788-89-90, to 381 l. And, in
1791, to 440 l. 3 s. Of this sum 284 l. was paid to the
poor upon the parish roll; about 46 l. was distributed in oc-
casional charity; about 74 l. was applied for the maintenance
of foundlings and deserted children; and 36 l. for clothing,
house rents, school wages, burials, and such incidental ex-
pences.  The small pittance allowed in the beginning of
these periods to the inrolled poor, in a place where all the
articles of living are dear, could scarcely be called an aliment.
It was from 2 s. to 10 s. per quarter; the average, to each per-
sons being about 5 s. At present, the allowance is from 4 s.
to 26 s. per quarter; the average being 12 s. 7 d. The num-
ber of inrolled poor is between 90 and 100.
   Till 1785, the poor were supported by the collections at
the church door; by the interest of some donations in the
management of the kirk session; by the dues for the pro-
clamation of banns of marriage, and a small turn arising from
the use of the mort cloths.  At that period it was proposed
to put a stop to the practice of vagrant begging, and as for
that end it was necessary to provide for the support of the
poor in their houses, a parochial assessment was resolved upon,
