     of Newton upon Ayr.

   Harbour.-Newton upon Ayr is a sea-port town; the north
east side of the river, lying in the parish, which, with the o-
ther side in the parish of Ayr, forms the harbour.-The town,
like that of Ayr, is situated at a small distance above the place
where the vesselsly.-A few houses, of late, have been built
nearer the quay.-The entrance to the harbour has always been
precarious, by reason of a bank at the mouth of the river, formed
chiefly by the sand that is carried down the river by landfloods; of
late years, the access has been still more difficult.  The bed of the
river is narrow, and the depth of water, at spring tides, not a-
bove 12 feet; so that vessels, exceeding 140 tons, register burden,
cannot be brought over the bar.-In December, 1789, con-
siderable damage was done to the shipping of this place: no
less a number than 12 vessels, in one night, were stranded,
some to the south, and others to the north of the harbour;
-one of them was totally wrecked, and all the hands in it pe-
rished:  several men, on board the other vessels, at the same
time, lost their lives.  This deplorable calamity pointed out
the necessity of erecting a light-house.  The design was ac-
cordingly carried into execution, by the gentlemen who rent
the coal belong the community.  At their own expence, they
erected, last year, two reflecting lights, both of which stand
on the north-east side of the harbour, in this parish.  A
small duty is paid by each vessel for maintaining them*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The following directions are to be observed, by vessels coming
into the harbour at any time of the night: "1ft, One of the lights
" continues burning all night: the other is lighted at half flood,
" and continues burning till half ebb. 2d, Both lights must be
" brought under one, which brings the vessels into the right chan-
" nel of best water, over the bar.  The bearance of the lights
" coming in by the compass, is S. E. by E. half E. 3d,  Vessels
