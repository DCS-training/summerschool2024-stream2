gow. A branch of the Glasgow Union Bank has been establish-
ed here for some time. The inhabitants are a well-informed,
reading people.
    Marriages.--In 1828 the number of proclamations in order to
marriage was 50. In 1829 it was 58; in 1830, 61; in 1831, 54;
in 1832, 61; in 1833, 65; and in 1834, 56. Among the lower classes,
large gatherings at weddings are very common. There is uniform-
ly a race for the broose. When the distance from the house
of the bridegroom is considerable, the company ride on horseback;
the bridegroom and bride, and as many as can crowd together tra-
vel generally in a chaise or coach. The broose, or contest who
shall first reach the house of the bridegroom, is then very keenly
maintained by the young men belonging to the different districts
of the parish; and if the parties belong to different parishes, much
anxiety is displayed by each party to get before the other, and
obtain honour to their parish.
   Births.--The number of births cannot be accurately stated, as
they are not regularly recorded in the parish register.
   Burials.--The number of burials here in 1828 was 147. In
1829, 114; in1830, 114; in 1831, 134; in 1832 199. (This
season we were visited with Asiatic Cholera, of which 50 of our
people died.) In 1833, 156; and in 1834, 115.
   Customs, &c.--Much time is lost, and no small expense unnecessa-
rily incurred, by the way in which funerals are conducted in this
parish. Great numbers of both men and women usually attend and
sit together and receive their "service" together in the barn or place
of meeting. Though warned to attend at twelve o'clock, they sel-
dom make their appearance till much later, and do not leave the
place of meeting with the body before two o'clock; and having
perhaps to travel several miles, the interment is seldom over
till towards four o'clock. In general, three "services" are given,
two glasses of wine, and one glass of whisky or rum. A practice
prevailed at one time very generally here, but which is now begin-
ning to wear out, of collecting vast-numbers of the friends and
neighbours together, to witness the "chesting," or putting the body
into the coffin. The writer of this has witnessed forty persons pre-
sent on such an occasion; after which they generally drink tea,
perhaps in the same apartment with the coffined remains of their
departed friend; and, except when some pious influential person
is present, it is to be feared that the conversation is not altogether
becoming the occasion.
