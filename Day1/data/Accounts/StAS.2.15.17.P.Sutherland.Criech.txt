                          PARISH OF CRIECH.

          PRESIBYTERY OF DORNOCH, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND
                             CAITHNESS.

                   THE REV.  MURDO CAMERON, MINISTER.


        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
     Extent and Boundaries.-THIS large parish extends from the
  parish of Dornoch on the east to the parish of Assynt on the
  west,-a distance of not less than thirty-five miles.  Its breadth
  is not, however, proportionate, varying from five to seven or eight
  miles in the eastern part, and narrowing towards the west.  It is
  bounded on the north by the parishes of bornoch and Lairg; and
  the Frith of Dornoch and its continuation, the river Oykell, forms
  its southern boundary.
     Topographical Appearances.-The greater part of the parish is
  mountainous, or rather hilly, for, excepting at its junction with As-
  synt, there is no very great elevation.
     It contains numerous lakes, including those of Migdale, Gour,
  Laggan, Buie, Laro, &c.,-which all abound with small trout; but
  none of these lakes are of any great extent.  They have been exam
  mined and found to contain no marl.
     Hydrography.-The rivers which find their way to the Frith of
  Dornoch in this parish are the Shinn, the Oykell and the Cassley,
  -the confluence of the two last of which forms the Frith, and is the
  point to which the tide flows.  These rivers all contain salmon,
  and are regularly fished.  Chalybeate springs are numerous.
     Mineralogy.-A mineralogical survey of part of this parish,
  made in 1789 by R. E. Raspe, a German mineralogist, employ-
  ed by Mr Dempster, reports that it does not contain any minerals
  worthy of notice.  Coal, which is found in an adjoining parish, is
  not found here: and it is uncertain whether there be limestone.
     There is at Rosehall a small vein of fine-grained, ponderous,
  solid, bluish-gray manganese, as perfect and free of iron as is
     SUTHERLAND.                     B
