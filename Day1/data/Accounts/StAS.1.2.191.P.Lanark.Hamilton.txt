of land, applied to any particular purpose.  For the like rea-
sons, it is equally difficult to ascertain the average amount of
the annual produce.  When, from the vicissitudes which oc-
cur in human affairs, old pastures are converted into tillage,
the quantity of grain raised is, necessarily, more abundant for
a time; but it is believed, that, in general, the produce of
the parish will scarcely yeild one half of its annual consump-
tion.
   Some farmers have got different kinds of new invented
ploughs, and have them occasionally drawn by two horses, and
worked by a plowman without an assistant.  But the Scots
plough, drawn by three or four horses, is the most common.
Some improvements have been lately made upon it; and when
a greater or lesser number of horses are yoked, as the resistance
may require, it is found to make excellent work, and to suit all
the various purposes of husbandry equally well, and, according to
some, rather better than any other.  A good deal of land here is
dug with the spade.  This is done for 25 or 26s per acre; and,
when the work is properly done, the crop is found fully to an-
swer the additional expence.
   The cultivation of the orchard has not been carried to such
a length, nor, perhaps, been so successful, as in some of the
neighbouring parishes.  Probably both the bottom and the ex-
posure are less favourable.  However, there are a good many
little orchards in the lower parts, producing apples, pears,
plumbs, and cherries.  In good seasons, they bear very good
and well-flavoured fruit; but, upon the whole, this is a very
precarious article of produce, subject to many injuries from
spring-frosts, the depredations of caterpillars, summer's
blights, etc. so that there is scarcely one year in three, in which
the orchards turn to good account.  The seasons, of late,
have been particularly unfavourable.  Considerable quantities
