     Statistical Account

   In the parish, there are 46 weavers' looms, of which
14 are muslin-looms; and I believe, there will soon be
more.  There are 16 shoemakers; 5 tailors, and their
apprentices; 3 wrights' shops; 3 coopers; and 1 flax-
dresser.  We have 9 masons, and 2 maltmen.  It 
is now more common for the sons of farmers to
be bound apprentices fo some of these trades than
formerly.  Many having learned the trades here, have
gone to towns, and have succeeded well.  Some few have
gone abroad.  We cannot be said to have any manufac-
tures.  One man may deal, to the extent of about 200 l.
a-year, in buying and manufacturing coarse yarn into
what is called brown linens, in flax-seed, and in giving
out flax to be spun by the women of the parish.  Some of 
the shoemakers work for the export trade carried on by
the merchants of Kilmarnock.-In ordinary seasons,
more meal is made in the parish than the inhabitants
consume; considerable quantities go E.  to Paisley, Glaf-
gow, and the places adjacent, as the people have friends
or connexions.  Many, or most of the farmers, satten 
their own winter meat.  A few fat cattle are killed after
it.  But there is no market for butcher-meat.  We get
that from Kilmarnock.  The meal is always 1 penny, and
sometimes more, the peck cheaper here than in the Glaf-
gow and Paisley markets.

<FOOTNOTE>

have exceeded, I am persuaded, the deaths; and perhaps there never were
in the parish more children and young persons, than at present.  There
are many who live to an advanced age.  One of Lord Glafgow' tenants,
near 90, comes to church almost every Sabbath, through a bad road; and
in the year 1784, Matthew Mowat, the bellman died, aged above 90.
He had the charge of the parish bell for above 80 years:  His father and
he had held the office from the time that the parish was erected, till then,
