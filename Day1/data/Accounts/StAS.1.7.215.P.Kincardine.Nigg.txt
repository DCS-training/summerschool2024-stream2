well prepared as they might do.  Indeed the condition of
the fishers on this coast needs to be relieved.  A hardy race
of men, more prolific than any other, so cheaply out-fitted
to gain bread and raise a family, employed in bringing in an
additional quantity of food, affording such a number to the
fleet for our common defence, and giving such a sum for
substitutes of one from each boat; they certainly deserve
of their country, and do essential service.  At the same time,
their gain for a livelihood, were they sensible of it, is infe-
rior now to that of many other ways of life; and by conti-
nuance, they may be tempted, as some of them elsewhere
have been, to change it for the chance of another.  In ad-
dition to such generous and humane exertions for their fa-
milies on disaster, as have already been made, some means
promising benefit seem to be these:  To preserve the coast
open to them for bait; to make the muscle, for the purpose
of bait, cheap; to order the number required from them for
the fleet, so as to put them no more in fear of impressing,
which interrupts their business; nor to such expence for sub-
stitutes, which has oppressed their families; to render the
wages of those who have died on board his Majesty's ships
recoverable at a low expence, which, it is hoped, the bill in-
troduced by Mr Dundas will do; and to make prize-money
recoverable.  An experiment might be made to improve the
distant fishery.  If a few decked vessels, which could wea-
ther a little rough sea, were employed on the banks the boats
could deposit their cargoes with them, and could have re-
course to them in danger, while the crews might fish with
the hand line.  The fishers presently fee 2, 5, 7, and more
Dutch ships at a time on this bank so engaged; and they
observe them catching many more cod and ling than them-
selves, which they attribute to the bait being hung at some
distance from the bottom by the hand-line, where there fish
