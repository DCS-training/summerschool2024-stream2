as not to be worth working.  A small rivulet in the East end
of the parish makes a very plentiful deposition of ochre,
which, if proper means were used to collect it, might turn to
some account.  Peats can easily be procured for fuel, but
few of them are used, the coals being found less costly.
A considerable quantity of them was formerly required by
the farmers for kiln-drying their victual; but by the introduc-
tion of kilns with brick heads, they have become less necessa-
ry, coals answering the purpose equally well.

   Antiquities.-Upon the high ground, in a commanding
situation, at the North West corner of the parish, stands an
old ruinous tower, being all that now remains of them mansion
house of the Galbraiths of Bathernock, which appears to
have been a large building surrounded with a ditch.  Its an-
tiquity must be very considerable, but how great, even tra-
dition does not venture to determine.  Not far from thence,
to the eastward, are several of those large loose heaps of stones
called Cairns, some of them oblong, and others of a circular
shape.  One of the circular ones, which has not yet been
broken up, is about 80 yards in circumference.  From two
that have been broken up, it appears that they are composed
of loose stones carelessly thrown together; but at the bottom
are large flags placed on edge, in two parallel rows, at the
distance of between 3 or 4 feet, lidded over with flags laid
across, the cavity thus formed is divided by partitions into
cells of 6 or 7 feet long.  In one of the long cairns lately
broken up, were found several fragments of a large coarsely
fabricated urn, and some pieces of human bones.  Tradition
says, that in this place, called Craigmadden moor, a battle
was fought with the Danes, in which one of their princes was
slain.  The farm in which these cairns are, is named Bloch-
airn, which may be a corruption of Balcairn, i. e. the town
