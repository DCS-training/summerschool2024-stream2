worth the while of a man of liberal education, that most
useful institution will soon be abandoned altogether, (as
it would have been already, in many places, were it not
a kind of interim employment to poor young lads, while
at college, and during the time they are studying divini-
ty,) and then the country people will return to ignorance
and barbarism: but the present fashionable paradox is, that
ignorance is the mother of industry; which is equally well
founded with the ancient aphorism, that ignorance is the

crop, and what they could purchase at L. 1, 4 s. Sterling

quarters of white pease, with their funds, together with
L. 100 Sterling, lent to the session, free of interest for nine
