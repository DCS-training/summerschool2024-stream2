divided from the common pasture by a turf or stone dyke;
but, in what is called a farm or town, there are perhaps 12
or 14 tenants, whose lands lie pro indiviso, and often runrig,
which effectually prevents smaller inclosures, and is, in many
other ways, inconvenient for the tenant.  In some farms of
30 or 40 merk land, there are often 4 heritors.  As the pos-
sessions are by far too small, the land is too frequently la-
boured.
   There are 14 ploughs in the parish, 4 oxen in each, who
go a-breast.  A large yoke is laid on the neck of the two
outermost, and a small yoke on the innermost oxen.  These
yokes are joined by a double rope, to the middle of which is
fixed the draught or chain, which is from 24 to 18 feet long,
from the neck of the oxen to the nose of the plough.  The
plough is of a very singular construction.  A crooked piece
of wood, bent (naturally) almost to a right angle, forms the
beam; to which is fixed a piece of oak stave, about 7 feet
long, which must be very pliable, and yield to the pressure
of the driver's hand, when he would deepen his fur.  The
coulter stands almost even up and down, and is always too 
short.  A square hole is cut through the lower end of the
beam, and the mercal, a piece of oak about 22 inches long,
introduced, which, at the other end, holds the sock and
sky.  The furrow is made deep or shallow, by driving a
wedge below or above the mercal, on the outside of the
beam.  There is a stilt on the top of the plough; and the
man who holds it, walks on the white land at the side of it.
This slender machine is liable to many accidents.  A stone
in the land, or even a stiff furrow, often breaks it in pieces,
and the labour is much retarded:  It turns the furrow almost
quite round about; and people are employed to cut and
smooth it with spades, before the seed is sown.  The outfields
generally lie ley one year, and are sown next April with
