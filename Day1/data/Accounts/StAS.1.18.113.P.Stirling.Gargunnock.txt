to families who may be in difficult circumstances, but whose
names are not on the poor's roll.
   There is now no assessment for their maintenance.  This
has been unnecessary for some years past, as supplies abun-
dantly sufficient have been obtained another way.
   George Moir, Esq. of Leckie, now deceased, generously
added 100 guineas to the poor's stock in 1788.  Being of
the Scotch Episcopal communion, he seldom attended the
Established church.  He saw however, and he had the hu-
manity to acknowledge, that the poor of the parish suffered a
1oss, by his absence; and when he gave the sum above men-
tioned, he said, "he was only paying what he owed them."
It is to be wished, that wealthy heritors who either do not
reside upon their estates, or who are too much in the habit of
being absent from church, would imitate him, in this instance,
and consider the case of the poor, who must sustain a loss,
when those in affluent circumstances withhold their weekly
collections at the church.  The chief resource for sup-
plying the poor in this parish, and in almost every parish in
Scotland, arises from the collections made at the church on
the Lord's day.
   At the same time, there are perhaps few country parishes
in Scotland, where there is more ample provision for the ne-
cessities of the poor, than in Gargunnock.  The capital stock
belonging to the Kirk Session, amounts to L. 365 Sterling,
the interest of which, together with the collections, mort-
cloth-money, the fees paid at marriages, baptisms, etc. af-
ford the widow, and the fatherless, the aged and infirm, a
considerable portion of the necessaries of life*.

singular circumstance.  Two old women, sisters, who lived in the village of
Gargunnock, had for many years, every appearance of extreme indigence;
