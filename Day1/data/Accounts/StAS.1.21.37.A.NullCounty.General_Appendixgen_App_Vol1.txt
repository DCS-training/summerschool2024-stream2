subject to the inconvenience of a bar, which at times, espe-
cially the violence of the N. W. winds, is thrown up
almost quite across the mouth of it.  This, however, is in
part cleared away, when the river happens to be greatly swell-
ed by rains; sometimes it is necessary to dredge it; and the
inconvenience is likely to be further remedied, by a good
stone wall, built on both sides of the river, which is now car-
rying on, and more than half finished.  Formerly the south
side of the river, beyond the Quay was fenced by large trian-
gular wooden boxes, filled with stones.  But these were found
to be very expensive, by the frequent repairs which they wan-
ted; and therefore, an attempt has of late been made, and is
already far on in the execution, to procure the same con-
venience, by building, instead of wooden boxes, a wall of the
same height, but entirely of stone, perpendicular on the side
next the river, and sloping off on the other side.  This, it is
hoped, will answer the same end, and be more durable.  In
the course of last year, there were built at some distance from
one another, but uniting in a line when viewed from the bar,
two reflecting light houses, to direct ships into the entrance
of the river.  From the mouth of the river southward, near-
ly in a direct line, and about a quarter of a mile distant from
one another, there lie four different heaps of large stones; of
which three are always to be seen at about half side, but the
fourth or northmost one, only at some very low ebbs.  These
stones, being many of them of great weight, and all of them
loose and unconnected, are listed by grappling irons fixed to
a crane, and conveyed on pontoons, and are found to be use-
ful materials for fencing the river, on both sides, by the walls
formerly mentioned.

this place, much to its emolument; but nothing of that kind
