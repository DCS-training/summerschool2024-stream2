     of Falkirk.

under review, the following names are the chief of those
which have been preserved on record: John Comyn, or
Cuming, of Badenoch, the younger; Sir John Stewart of
Bonkill, and not of Bute, as tradition has handed it down.
This gentleman was brother to the Steward of Scotland,
from whom the sirname of Stemwart, or Stuart, was taken.
To these we must add Sir John Graham* of Abercorn or
Dundaff; and Macduff, the uncle of the Earl of Fife.+
   Wallace had arranged his infantry in four bodies, of a
circular form, with the convex side toward the enemy; the
archers formed a line between the circles; and the cavalry
were placed at a little distance in the rear.  The strength
of Edward's army consisted of cavalry, which were drawn
up in three lines; and the third, which was intended to be
kept as a corps of reserve, was commanded by the king
himself.  Nothing being said of the manner in which the
English infantry were disposed, we are naturally led to
believe, that they were not numerous.
   A morass, which was in front of the Scotch army, but
is now drained by the canal, prevented the troops of Ed-
ward from attacking the Scotch in front; but wheeling to
the right and left, they flanked them on both sides, and
the carnage was dreadful.  Struck with a panic by the fall
of Graham, Stewart, and Macduff, and pressed by the well
appointed cavalry of England, they were compelled, after
a brave resistance, to abandon the conflict, and leave the
victory in the hands of Edward.
   Sir John Graham and Sir John Stewart were both buried
in the church-yard of Falkirk.  The stone which was laid
on the grave of Sir John Graham had some sculpture upon
it, which the hand of time was fast obliterating.  At length
