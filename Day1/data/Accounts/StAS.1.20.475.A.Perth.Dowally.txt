it is impossible that in any case agriculture should advance
in improvement*.  Some of these obstacles existed in Dow-
ally, and the Duke of Atholl, who is the sole proprietor of
the parish, saw, and sought to remove them.  It is pleasing
to add, that his Grace's plans for this purpose have been

heightened, both the face of the country, and the condition
of the tenantry, have been at the same time sinsibly melio-

   The new arrangements respecting the crops and the cul-
ture of the parish, drew their efficacy from the five follow-

the low grounds in winter:  4.  That leaves of due length
should be granted:  And, 5.  That a proper rotation of crops
should be prescribed.

even when he does casually see them, his ignorance of the language of
the improver prevents his gaining any minute or beneficial acquaintance
with them.
