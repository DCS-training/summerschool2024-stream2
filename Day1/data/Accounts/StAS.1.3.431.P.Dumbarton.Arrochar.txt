it being fereened by the mountain from the northerly
and easterly winds, the cold in winter is not so intense
as in the low country; but there are frequent and heavy
falls of rain from the south and south-west, accompanied
with high winds.  There are no local distempers preva-
lent here, except fevers, to which the poorer people are
subject in the latter end of winter and beginning of spring.
With respect to the small pox, the people begin now to see
the advantages of inoculation, and to be more reconciled
to it, though it is not yet much practised among the lower
class.

   Sheep, Horses, etc.-The number of sheep in the parish
amounts to about 10,600; horses, 60; black cattle, 460.
The sheep, in general, are black faced, and of the Linton
kind.  The white wool has sold here, these two years past,
at about 7 s. per stone of 24 lb. English weight, and the laid
at 5 s. On an average, 8 or 9 sleeces of the white, and 5
or 6 of the laid wool go to the stone.  If a premium were
given annually for the best tups, there would be a competi-
tion, and cosequently a considerable improvement made
both on the sheep and wool.  It is expected, that the Hon.
Board of Trustees in Edinburgh, will give the same encou-
ragement to this district of the country of Dumbarton, for
the improvement of the breed of sheep, that they give to
some other countries in the Highlands of Scotland.

   Trees.-There is a considerable deal of oak growing in
this parish, on the banks of Lochlomond.  But as the woods
are generally cut about 20 or 24 years of age, there is no
great timber in them, except some standards left at last cut-
ting.
