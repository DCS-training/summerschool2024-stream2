     of Lunan.

lukie, measuring 400 acres, including.  180 acres of moor, or 
coarse pasture, belongs to Robert Stephen, Esq; of Letharn.
Lunan, measuring 215 acres, including 62 acres of moor and
waste ground, belongs to Alexander Taylor Imray of Lunan.
The whole parish, accordingly, when the glebe is taken into
the account, consists of 973 acres arable, and 438 waste land.
Of these, 40 acres annually bear wheat, 187 barley, 270 oats,
45 turnip or cabbage, 10 potatoes or yams, 16 flax, 40 pease,
324 sown grass, and 40 lie fallow.  Some tenants have made
attempts to inclose part of their farms with fences of earth
topped with furze; but few of them are so complete as to,
answer the purposes of a fence.  The farmers appear fully
sensible of the advantages of inclosures; and most of them
in the neighbourhood have begun to inclose with stone-
walls; a practice which would be generally adopted, were it 
not for the difficulty in some places of getting stones, and
the shortness of many leases.  The parish does much more
than supply itself with provisions; more than one half of
the produce being annually carried to market, to which there
is easy access by the high road.  This road, and the bridges
on it, were chiefly made, and have been hitherto wholly kept
in repair, by the statute labour, which was sometimes exacted
in kind, and sometimes commuted; but, by an act of parlia-
ment passed 1790, it was made turnpike, which farmers at
present consider as a very great grievance.  The season for
sowing wheat is October; oats from the middle of March to
the middle of April; barley in May; and turnip in June.
Ilay and harvest time generally continue from July to Sep-
tember.  There are in the parish 250 black cattle, 62 horses,
21 carts, and 16 ploughs, drawn usually by 4 horses or 4
oxen, except in the seed time, when 2 horses only are used;
and then the number of ploughs are about a third more.
