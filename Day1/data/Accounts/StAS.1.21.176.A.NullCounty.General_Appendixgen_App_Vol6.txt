     General Appendix to [Vol. vi.

   The quantity of moss that one man can move in a day is
surprising; when he meets with no interruption, seldom less
than 48 cubic yards, each weighing 90 stones.  The weight,
then, of moss moved per day is no less than 4320 stones.  A
cubic yard is moved into the water, and of course carried into
the river Forth, for one farthing.  It follows, that the ex-
pence of moving 48 cubic yards is one shilling.  But the
same quantity moved to the same distance by carts would cost
24 shillings.  Hence the advantage derived from the possi-
bility of floating moss in water, and the great importance of
having water for that purpose.
   The moss, when contrasted with the rich lands surround-
ing, appeared, especially before the improvements, a very
dreary spot; one wide unvaried wild, totally unproductive,
unfit even to furnish sustenance to any animal, except here
and there a few wretched straggling sheep.  Besides, it en-
tirely cut off all connection betwixt the farms on either side;
amongst which no intercourse was practicable but by a cir-
cuit of several miles.
   The scene is already greatly changed.  The following are
the numbers of the inhabitants now residing in the moss;
also of their cows and horses, and of the acres gained by
them from the moss, together with their produce.
