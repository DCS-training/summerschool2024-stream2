                           PERTH.                               25

   When this charter was granted may be inferred from the follow-
ingfacts. Hugh Roxburgh, Bishop of Glasgow, was made Chancel-
lor of Scotland in 1189, and died in 1199. Philip de Valoines was
made great Chamberlain about the year 1180, and held the office
about thirty-three years. Duncan M'Duff the father of Malcolm Earl
of Fife died in 1203, and William de Hay died before the year 1199.
The charter then must have been granted before the end of 1199,
that is, ten years before Boetius'ancient Bertha was destroyed, and
a new city Perth built in another place. And it may be proper to
observe, that every person who is acquainted with Perth at the pre-
sent day can without the least difficulty, and with the utmost cer-
tainty, point out the localities described in the charter. So that
Perth now is exactly where and what it locally was in 1199.
   The Picts, after they embraced the Christian faith, consecrated
the church and bridge of Perth to John the Baptist. John, they
appear to have made the tutelary saint of the town. Hence it
was called St Johnstoun. In the Scotichronicon, Vol. ii. p. 99, it
is called St Johnstoun, as the name by which it had been pre-
viously known. "Villa St Johannis, quae nunc Perth dicitur,
Bertha dicebatur." Unde

	 Villa Johannis pluribus annis Bertha dicebatur;
	 Perth quoque dicitur, ac, quia vincitur sic vocitatur.

But there is no.public document in which it is designated St
Johnstone.
   Burgh Sea-In the reign of Alexander II A. D. 1213-1249,
the burgh had a common seal, but its particular character and im-
pression are unknown. Of the seal which it had in the year 1400,
many impressions are still in existence, appended to the charters
of the religious houses of Perth.*
   On the obverse it represented the beheading of John-Salome

<FOOTNOTE>This seal is appended to several charters of the following dates: Nov. 1, 1454.
Aug. 12, 1457; Dec. 14, 1470.
