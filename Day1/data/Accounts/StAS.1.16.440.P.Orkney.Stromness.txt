   Since this struggle for independence, the trade of the
village has greatly increased, which is in a great measure
owing to the resort of shipping to this place.
   While the American Colonies were connected with,
and dependent upon Britain, several American vessels came
here, and entered their cargoes at the sight of the officers of
the customhouse of Kirkwall, preferring this place even
to Cowes, in the Isle of Wight.  The advantages resulting
herefrom to this village, induced some mercantile people
at the borough of Kirkwall to attempt bringing these ves-
sels there; and, in order to effect this, they represented the
harbour of Stromness as a small creek, to which the port
of Kirkwall was preferable.
   The American goods were unloaded, and weighed aboard
an old and large dismasted vessel, which lay in the harbour
of Stromness for this purpose.  This dismasted vessel or
hulk was brought to the harbour of Kirkwall, with a view
to bring the American vessels there; but this did not suc-
ceed, as they then preferred going to Cowes, in the Isle of
Wight, and entering at the customhouse there, on their
way to Holland and the East countries.
