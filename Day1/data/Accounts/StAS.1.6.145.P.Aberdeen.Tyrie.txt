the comforts of life; nor did he treat them like cattle, as
occasions offered.  The good effects of these encouragements
are, extensive fields regularly laid out, fine stone fences, good
houses built with stone and lime, excellent crops of turnips,
sown grass, and almost all forts of grain, stocks of cattle,
full corn yards, and every where the appearance of plenty.
Hay, formerly unknown, is now plenty.  Commerce and

Sir William Forbes.  To see what improvements can do, look
at his farm of Tillenamolt; there may be seen good crops of
fown grass, grain, and turnip, upon about 30 or 40 acres of
moor, formerly not worth 2 d. the acre.  Is it not deplorable
that many hundred acres in this parish should produce nothing
but heath, not from barrenness, but from indolence?  that
waste land of a good quality should abound in many places,
which some skill and proper industry would fertilize?

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-Several young men, at different
periods, have become sailors and soldiers.  Some, encoura-

seasonably prevented.  America is represented to be a whole-
some and pleasant country, where the people, enjoying the
rights of freemen, have a vote in the election of their legista-
tors, pastors, and magistrates: a country provided by divine
