   Fuel.-The labouriug being ended, the next work which
comes on, is to make provision for winter firing.  We have
fuel in great abundance, and of an excellent quality.  Cutting,
winning, anti carrying home their peats, however, consumes
a great deal of time, notwithstanding they be at no great dis-
tance from them, most places having ready access to the ad-
jacent moors and commons.  Their labour, in this respect,
however, will become less, as they now begin to use carts
even for that purpose.  As yet they are, in general, of a very
trifling kind, though, at the same time, tolerably well adapted
to the size of their cattle; and the principal use made of them,
is to carry out their dung in the bear-feed season.  Amongst
the gentlemen and more substantial farmers, carts of a very
good size are used; some drawn by horses, others by 2 oxen,
and applied to all the purposes of farming and carriages.

   Houses, Cattle, etc.-After the peats are brought home, their
next labour, is the repairing and trimming of their houses: And
this they are under the necessity of doing annually.  We have
no wood growing; and what is imported sells at a very high
rate.  This circumstance obliges the people to use as little of
that article, in the construction of their houses, as possible.
Though their possessions be small, they keep a number of
cattle, poorly fed, at all seasons.  A farmer here, who rents
only to the extent of 3 L. and 9 bolls, makes a shift to keep
alive from 4 to 6 little horses, from 16 to 20 head of black
cattle, and from 20 to 30 head of sheep.  This stock (for,
during all seasons, they are houses in the night time, except
their horses, which, throughout the summer, lie on the com-

season.  By these means they have an opportunity of discovering any sheaves 
that may chance to be spoiled by rain or heat, and of separating them from 
what is entirely found.
