Prior to the 1745, there was not a tea-kettle within the
parishes, except the minister's; now there is not a farm-
house without one, and several of the subtenants use
the same piece of furniture.  Formerly there was little
beef or mutton used.  Even a farmer's family thought
themselves sufficiently provided in flesh-meat with one
old ewe killed about Christmas.  For such a family at pre-
sent 16 stone of beef, and 2 good sheep are considered
as a moderate provision.  About 20 years ago, neither
barn nor mill fanners for cleaning victual were to be
seen; at present each of the three mills has a set of fan-
ners, and there are but very few farmers, whose barns are
not furnished with the same useful machine.  There has
also been within these 4 or 5 years, a barley-mill erec-
ted, much to the convenience of the neighbourhood.  For-
merly the people, especially such as were wealthy, lived
frequently in fear lest their houses should be broken, and
their property plundered; at present they live so secure in
some places, that, as is said they are seldom at the pains to
bolt the door under night.
