     Of Kinghorn.

tradesmen, innkeepers, and horse-hirers; those of the coun-
try, farmers, their children, and servants, who are employed
in agriculture.

   Ecclesiastical State, Stipend, Poor, etc.-There are two pla-
ces of public worship in the town of Kinghorn; the parish
church, and a Burgher-seceder meeting-house.  The Earl of
Strathmore is patron of the parish.  The stipend consists of 3
chalders of victual, half meal, half bear, and 58 L. 6 s. 8 d. in
money, together with 4 loads of coal, deliverable at the manse,
and the teind of the fish.  The last of these articles has fail-
ed entirely, as there is no more at present, but one family of
fishers in the town, and the quantity of fish caught to small,
that the teind thereof is not worth the trouble or expense of
collection it.
   There is also mentioned in the decreet of modification and
locality of the stipend of Kinghorn, 14 1/2 loads of coal at the
pit of Carden; but as this pit is not now wrougth, this part
of the living has likewise failed.  The glebe consists of very
little more than 3 1/2 acres of arable ground with 10 s. a-year
to compensate for the deficiency of measure; and about an a-
cre of grass, which lets at 16 s. 8 d.  The manse is old, but
got a thorough repair about 3 years ago, at a very consider-
able expense.  The church was rebuilt in 1774.  The shell
of the house is respectable enough; but within, it has rather
an awkward and paltry appearance, from its not being as yet
completely seated, and from the mixture of new, and of old
pews and forms*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The Burgher meeting-house was built about 16 years ago, partly by dissa-
tisfied and discontented Seceders; and partly by people belonging to the Esta-
blished Church in this place, who did not think that the late incumbent, Dr.
Webster, was sufficiently warm in his zeal against the Popish bill, which raised
such a noise and clamour in this part of the country at that period.
