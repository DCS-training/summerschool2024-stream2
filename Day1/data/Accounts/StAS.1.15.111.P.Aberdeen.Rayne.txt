   Soil and Cultivation-The in-field soil is generally a rich
loam, with a clay bottom; and, when well managed, produ-
ces good crops.  The present minister has often had a re-
turn, after a crop of turnips, of 14 bolls of good bear, upon
an acre sowed with ten pecks.  The out-field, which con-
stitutes more than two thirds of the arable ground, is gene-
rally of a light loamy soil, and, when dunged and limed,
produces grain of a sharper and better quality, than the
in-field.  The large farms, which are very few, are plowed
by oxen, of 8 or 10 in a plough.  But the greatest part of
the parish consists of crofts, or small holdings, plowed by
two horses, and sometimes two horses and two cows, and that
very imperfectly.  The tenants are at no pains to clean their
grounds of a great deal of weeds, such as runches or wild
mustard, knot-grass, couch-grass, and wild oats.  Indeed
there are too many small crofts; and the occupiers of them
are so poor, that their cattle have not strength enough to
plow and dress them properly.  As there is plenty of peat
moss, which most of the parishioners have a right to, the pro-
prietors have by this means broken down the possessions, and
raised their rents; but this has been a bar to the improvement
of the ground.  A better mode of farming, however, has of
late got in among some of the tenants, who bring lime from
Aberdeen, and lay down an acre with turnips yearly, and the
year after sow it with bear, and red clover and rye-grass
seeds.  They already see the great advantage of there little
improvements, and they will doubtless soon extend them far-
ther; and others will be led to follow their example.  Their
great distance from lime or manure of any kind is no small
obstacle to improvement.
