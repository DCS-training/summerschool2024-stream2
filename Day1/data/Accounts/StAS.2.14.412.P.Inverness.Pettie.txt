properties paid for the pew which he occupied. The fishers
erected one gallery and the session another, for which they took
rent for a time, and which they ultimately sold. The tradition
is, that it was for this church that the first ship laden with lime
came to the beach; and the point where the lime was landed ob-
tained the name it bears, Rue an-aoil. In 1810, the church-yard
and the garden were enclosed with a sunk fence, and repairs made
on the church and manse, and the offices built, the cost of which
amounted to L. 827 Sterling. In 1811, on repairs, L. 100. In
1828, for the school-house, L. 200. We have not found the ex-
pense of the precedidg school-houses. Between 1836 and 1839,
the church, manse, and garden wall were rebuilt, and the offices
repaired, which, including plans, &c. cost L. 2022, 12s. a draw-
back of L. 113 on glass and timber used in the church was ob-
tained. It is due to the heritors to say, that all that was found
requisite, they in, the most prompt and liberal manner resolved to
provide. The church is a model for a country church; and the
entire accommodations are sufficient and satisfactory in every re-
spect. Some approximation may be made from this statement
towards ascertaining how far the free teind in the heritors' hands
has been consumed, or a tax on the rental occasioned by the cost
of the parochial buildings, for the last century.
   The glebe of Pettie was enlarged bv an excambion, so as to in-
clude the equivalent for that of Bracholy. The arable glebe, ex-
clusive of the garden, and of the declivity from the churchyard to
the marsh, is upwards of twelve acres in extent. About six acres
are made to differ from the unreclaimed sand only by the force of
cultivation. The stipend is 15 chalders. When the stipend was
modified on the 1st July 1829, there appeared a free teind of
L.238, 15s. 11d., out of which there was allocated 29 bolls, 2 fir-
lots, 25/8 lippies meal, and same of barley.
   The population, with the, exeeption of two Roman Catholics,
and two families belonging tn tbe Secession, are of the Establish-
ed Church. The number of communicants in the parish is as fol-
lows:--Males, 36; females, 45; in all, 81.
   The church collections for the last seven years are shown by

<FOOTNOTE>The collections of this year were raised above the average of that period in con-
sequence of the alarm occasioned by the appearance of the cholera at Inverness hav-
ing led the inhabitants of that parish, on the east, to attend at Pettie.
