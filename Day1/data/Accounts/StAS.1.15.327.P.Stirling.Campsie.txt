tion of naturalsts, of two species, primary and secondary; in
the first, it is said that coal and lime are never to be found,
whereas the second abounds with both.
   The highest ridge of the Campsie Fells, is about 1500 feet
above the level of the sea, and about 1200 from its base;
where, properly speaking, the mountain commences, the as-
cent is very rapid; and from examining the glens, and gul-
lys formed on its sides, it seems to be composed of the fol-
lowing strata:  At the base of the hill, immediately after the
coal is cut off, you meet with several layers of camstone, (as
it is termed with us,) which is easy burned into a heavy lime.
Immediately above the camstone, you find at least a dozen
strata of ironstone, of different thickness, with a soft slate
interveening betwixt the layers; it is said by those who have
examined the ironstone, that it is of an excellent quality.
These different seams make up 200 feet of the base of the
mountain.  Then 15 strata of muirstone rise above each o-
ther to the summit of the Fells, where they jut out; in the
face of the braes, they go by the name of dasses or gerrocks.
Betwixt these strata of muirstone, you meet with various co-
loured stuff, sometimes of a copperish, sometimes of an iron-
stone colour; and it is said, there are appearances of copper;
but the working of it has not as yet been attempted.  Lately,
when forming the new turnpike-road along the side of the
hills, several veins of spar and chrystal were found, not un-
like those which accompany lead-mines; and persons who
had wrought at the different lead-mines in Scotland, declar-
ed, that the appearances of that metal were both frequent and
favourable: no attempt as yet hath been made to follow out
these appearances.  In the whole range of the Campsie Fells,
there is only one place where the rocks assume a basaltic ap-
pearance; and by those who admire such columnar appear-
