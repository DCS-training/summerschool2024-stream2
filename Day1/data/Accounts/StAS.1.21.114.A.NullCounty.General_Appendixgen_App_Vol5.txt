   There had been some chapels and altarages at Caldhame,
part of the country parish to the east of the town: of which,
some vestiges still remain.  King James VI. in the year 1572,
mortified to the town of Brechin, for the uses of their poor,
all the revenues belonging to any chaplainry or altarage with-
in the cathedral church of Brechin.  But, in a declarator at

nether tenements, are called the first charge.  The west
part of the town, the upper and nether west wynds, and
the whole country parish to the west and south, are cal-

in the gift of the crown.
