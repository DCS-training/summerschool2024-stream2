severely on this coast, during the winter season.  The property
of the borough, however, might be much improved, and its
value greatly increased.-The only public road, is the high
way leading through Prestick, to Kilmarnock and Glasgow,
which is always kept in tolerable repair.  On this road there
are two turnpikes within the parish; one of which rents at
L. 100, and the other at L. 285 per annum.

   Population of the Parish.-Not above a century ago, New-
ton contained few inhabitants; probably from 300 to 400.
Within the last 40 years, the number has greatly increased.
This increase was chiefly owing to an extensive herring fishe-
ry, at that time, carried on along this coast, particularly near
the mouth of the river, which continued upwards of 15 years.
-When the coalleries on the Newton and Blackhouse
grounds began, the number of the inhabitants still increased.
In the year 1778, when the present incumbent made his first
parochial visitation, the number from 7 years of age, and up-
wards, was 1200; and that of souls, 1600.  Since that time,
no enumeration of souls hath been taken.  For some years af-
terwards, the number rather decrased, owing to the failure
of the coal-works.  But since these have been resumed, which
was about 5 years ago, the number has been increasing.  At
the last visitatin, in summer, 1790, there were found 1350
persons, from 7 years and upwards:  Of these, 610 were
males, and 740 females; the number of families amounting
to 380; the number of souls to about 1750.-The follow-
ing is a statement of the births and marriages, for the last 10
years:
