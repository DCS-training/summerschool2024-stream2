     of Rafford.

   Situation, etc.-It is situated in the county of Elgin,
presbytery of Forres, and Synod of Moray; extends from
N. E. to S. W. above 8 English miles in length, and from
5 to 3 miles in breadth.  On the E. it is bounded by the
parishes of Alves and Elgin; on the S. by those of Dallas
and Edinkillie; on the W. by the river Findhorn, and the
parish of Forres; and on the N. by that of Kinloss.

   Soil, etc.-The face of the country is much diversified;
part of it being low, flat, and fertile; part of it elevated,
moorish, and rocky.  The complexion of the soil, too, is
various; consisting of a deep and rich clay, a hot and blow-
ing sand, a black and shallow mould, bottomed with rock;
though the greater part is composed of a rough brown gra-
vel, where the bottom is a continued stratum of small peb-
bles, so closely compacted that no ploughshare almost can
pierce it, and having the appearance of calcination.

   Climate, etc.-The air can hardly be said to possess any
specific quality; it is rather dry than moist, rather healthy
than otherwise.  The most prevalent distempers, at least
such as generally prove most fatal, are fevers, consumptions,
and asthmas; these may partly be owing to the heat and
dryness of the soil, to the close and smoky air of the dwell-
ings, as well as to the nature of the food, especially pota-
toes, on which, for several months of the year, many of
the poorer class are almost wholly sustained.

   Hills.-The hills, none of which are remarkable for
height, are chiefly covered with heath, furze, whins, and
juniper.  They produce abundance of excellent peat, turf,
fallen fir, and other fuel, and afford extensive pasturage for
sheep and black cattle.
