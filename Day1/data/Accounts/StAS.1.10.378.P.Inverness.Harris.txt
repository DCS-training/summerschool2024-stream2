name was held by the people.  There are two of this name
mentioned in our ecclesiastical history.  Both of them flou-
rished in the eight century; and from the circumstances re-

have been canonized by the church of Rome.  One of them,
for struggling against the encroachments of Papal tyranny,
was persecured, A.D. 747, by Boniface Archbishop of
Mentz, and afterwards condemned both at Mentz and at
Rome; and the other was graciously entertained by the Em-

the Caroline books against the second council of Nice.  This
last Clement is said to have taught the first grammar school
in Paris.  It is most likely that the first mentioned Clement,

principles, would naturally retire to his own country, where
Popish doctrines were as yet unknown, was the person who
laid the foundation of the religious seminary at Rowdill, as-

be supposed to have flourished thenceforward in peace and
prosperity, till the period of the Danish invasions, when the
Monks deprived of their lands, and pent up within the walls
of their convent in great distress, the ravaged country afford-
ing them no means of subsistence, would very naturally look
up to so pious a Monarch as David for aid and protection,
under the calamitous circumstances to which they were now

bey, afterwards substantiated, when the Western Isles became
incorporated with the Scottish kingdom.  Thus we account
for King David's pretended donation.  Buchanan says, the
monastery of Rowdill was built by Alexander Macleod of
