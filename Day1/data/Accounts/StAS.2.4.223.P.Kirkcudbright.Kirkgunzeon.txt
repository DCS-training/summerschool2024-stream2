			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	Since the former Statistical Account was written, the parish
has been greatly improved. The arable land vas then 3000 acres
in extent, but now it amounts to 5000 or 6000 acres. A great
many acres have been planted since that period, and the planta-
tions will soon add much to the beauty of the country. The lands
are all subdivided, and the fences kept in good order. The farm-
houses, which were formerly in a miserable state, are now com-
fortable and commodious, and good offices are attached to them.
They were built and finished at a great expense, and the expense
was wholly defrayed by the proprietor. The people are now com-
fortably lodged and clothed, and their provisions are more plen-
tiful and of a better kind than formerly. The tenants pay their
rents half-yearly; and there is scarcely an instance of a farmer not
paying every farthing of his rent on the day of collection. Formerly
the farmers had gre`t difficultx in paying the trifling rent which
was then demanded; and it is well known that at the conclu-
sion of the American war, many were in arrears for the by-
gone rents of several years. The landlord and the factor were
indulgent; and it is worthy of remark, that every shilling of
these arrears was paid up, when the state of the country began to
improve.
