     Stitistical Account

riod ran through its bounds, was merely a line traced by 
frequent passengers on the surface of the soil.  A new post-
road, formed 20 years since to the northward of Barrie pa-
rish, has annually engrossed nearly the statute-labour of the
contiguous district.  The small reversion allotted to Barrie,
has been faithfully and judiciously applied by a resident Ju-
stice of the Peace; but in a light sandy track, where gra-
vel cannot be obtained without great expence, it may well
be concieved, that the repairs effected by a trisling sum,
can neither be permanent nor extensive.  Nature, how,
ever, has not been unkind; the roads of Barrie, though
somewhat fatiguing, are at all seasons dry.  Voluntary con-
tributions reared, and have hitherto supported, the bridges
within the parish.  A detailed account of the bridges
would reflect no honour on the police of the district.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-Vicinity to the sea is
an obvious advantage to this parish.  Though it has no
formed harbours, the surrounding beach affords a safe land-
ing place to small vessels; by which lime, the staple ma-
nure, and coals, the chief article of fuel, are imported
from the frith of Forth, and sold at 2 reasonable rate.
Lime shells are delivered from the ship at 1 s. 6 d. the
boll.  Coals, conveyed to the most distant parts of the
parish, are bought by the cottager at 6 s. 8 d. weighing
72 stones.  -But amid the advantages which Providence
has already bestowed, and human improvements promise
to confer, the parishioners of Barrie experience a rigorous
astriction to a barony mill; a species of vassalage, which
they deem an inconvenience of no trivial kind.  Legal ap-
plications for redress have hitherto produced a very par-
tial relief; while, from the unavoidable ambiguity of
old papers, the reciprocal services of the millmaster, and
the astricted farmer, furnish a source of hourly discord;
