him to continue the plan, but the scanty supply of dung pre-
vented him.  He therefore now substitutes a turnip crop for
the summer fallow, and a barley crop for the wheat; and
from an exact calculation, he finds he is a gainer by this lat-
ter method.  If this practice should become general, it will
certainly be more profitable than the method at present in
use.

of excellence, by the attention which has been given to pro-
