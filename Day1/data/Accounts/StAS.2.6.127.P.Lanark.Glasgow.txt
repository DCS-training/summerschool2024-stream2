population consisting of about 11,000 souls, the rate of mortality
was as one in thirty-six and one eighth. Mr Finlaison stated in
evidence, that " he was enabled to determine that Ostend is (not,
withstanding the opinion that prevails in England) a very healthy
situation, and no doubt is equal to the average of England, at
least the only knowledge of the law of mortality, as prevailing
among the lower classes in England, on which he was able to de-
pend, is derived from that which he obtained in Flanders."
	Probability of human life in Glasgow.-- That Glasgow is a place
of average health for statistical purposes, may be inferred from the
statement under the head climate. But more particularly the de-
gree of health may be known, and tables formed for ascertaining
the probability of human life, from a series of the mortality bills,
where the ages of the living, and those of persons who have died,
are stated in connection with the population, and a table of longe-
vity for Scotland, which Dr Cleland prepared in 1821, by which
it appeared that, on an average of all the counties of Scotland,
there was one person eighty years of age, for every 143 92/100 of the
population, whilst in the county of Lanark, with a population of
316,790, including 263,046, who live in towns, viz. in Glasgow,
202,426, and in other towns, 60,620, there was one such person for
every 169. 71/100, showing a degree of health in the population of
Glasgow nearly equal to that of the whole of Scotland.
	The following results have reference to Glasgow and its su-
burbs, which partake of a mercantile and manufacturing popula-
tion, or something between Liverpool and Manchester, but more
especially the latter, the town population being 198,518 and the
rural, 3908. In 1831, the population was found to be 202,426,
the burials 5185, and the rate of mortality consequently 39. 4/100.
The births being 6868, there is one birth for every 29 47/100 per-
sons. The number of marriages being 1919, there are 3 57/100 births,
to each marriage, and one marriage for every 105 48/100 persons,
the number of families being 41,965 there are 4 88/100 persons
to each family. It is very satisfactory to know that with the same
machinery in 1821, the population being 147,043, the burials
3686, the rate of mortality was 39 89/100 or, in other words, as near
as may be to the mortality of 1831. By reference to the bills of
mortality between the years 1821 and 1831, similar results will be
obtained.
	Thus it appears that the mortality in England in 1892 was as-
sumed to be one 36 1/1 in derived from date of about 11,000 souls
