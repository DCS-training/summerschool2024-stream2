way of some of Lord Aberomby's tenants and other two went up before a
steam-boat to Stirling, where they shared the same fate. On examination, they
appeared to be a species of the grampus, and seemed to agree with those described
by Dr Patrick Neill, to which the islanders of Orkney and Shetland give the name
of the caling whale, having several marks to distinguish them from the common gram-
pus. They were from 15 to 21 feet long, and from 10 to 14 feet in circumference.
  (10.) A stray individual of this singular species of small whale had been for some
time observed passing up and down the Firth of Forth, its fine white colour render-
ing it very remarkable. In June 1815, it was killed by the salmon-fishers, by means of
spears and fire-arms; and was purchased by Robert Bald, Esq. Alloa, who transmitted
it to Baillie Robert Johnstone, Edinburgh, who presented it to Professor Jameson for the
Royal Museum. It was exhibited on the Calton Hill for behoof of the poor, when
L.40 were drawn. The skeleton was for some years in Dr Barclay's Museum, and
he lectured on the anatomy of the whale while it was on the Calton Hill.  The stuf-
fed skin is now in the Royal Museum at Edinburgh. Those larger visitors are found
in this river more frequently than in others further to the north, the entrances of
which are less extended, and more interrupted by banks and bars. The salmon, on
the other hand, as if instinctively to avoid their enemies, are more abundant in the
confined estuaries.

(1) "If this useful bird," says Mr Waterton, "caught its food by day, instead of
hunting for it by night, mankind would have ocular demonstration of its utility in
thinning the country of mies, and it would be protected and encouraged everywhere.
It would be wish us what the Ibis was with the Egyptians." They are found in va-
rious perts of the parish, and sometimes in the top of Alloa Tower.

(2) Commonly considered a distinct species. This beautiful bird,--
                ("His varied plumage life a heap of germs
                  On a coarse carpet spread,")
Is much less autherous here than it was some years ago. This must be attributed to
