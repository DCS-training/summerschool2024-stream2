     Statistical Account

   Population, etc.-The return to Dr Webster in 1755,
amounted to 755 souls.  The population of the parish has
been in a fluctuating state, in so far as regards the village,
since the year 1790, seldom remaining stationary for a single
week.  In December 1792, there were in the parish 1381
souls.  Of this number the village contained 981, and of
these 930 were new settlers.
   Of the above number, 805 were of the Established Church,
459 Antiburgher Seceders, who have had a place of worship
in the parish about 60 years, 64 Papists, 18 of the Relief Per-
suation, 17 Cameronians, 9 Burgher Seceders, and 9 of the
Church of England.
   There were besides about 200 people, including all ages,
imported to the village at Whitsunday 1793, when the print-
ing and bleaching commenced; so that, at that period, there
were in the village about 1181, and in the parish 1581 souls.
   The people employed at the printfield and bleachfield,
are almost wholly of the Relief and Burgher Persuation; and,
besides these already mentioned as residing in the village in
December 1792, there were several families of the same per-
suations who had given a temporary adherence to the Estab-
lished Church; bat at Whitsunday 1793 being joined, all at
once, by so many of their sect, each party immediately set up
a tent for themselves, and have ever since been contending,
with much animosity, for the honour of making proselytes.
It is not, therefore, easy to ascertain the present state of the
parish, with respect to sectaries; and it is still more difficult
to say what it will be a few years hence.
   Till very lately, there was no regular record kept of births,
deaths, and marriages.  From Whitsunday 1792 to Whitsun-
day 1793, there were 67 births, 46 deaths, and 30 mar-
riages.
