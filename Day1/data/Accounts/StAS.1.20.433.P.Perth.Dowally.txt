their funds to indigent members.  The meeting is styled a
Court*.  All members coming to the market are obliged
to attend it.  They are summoned by one of the office
bearers, who, to enforce their attendance, goes round to the
different booths, in open market, and takes from each a
piece of goods, or 2 s. 6 d. as a pledge for his appearance.
Each must produce his measures and weights, which are
compared with standards kept for the purpose+.  If they
are found disicient, he is fined at the discretion of the
court.  He must produce also, under a penalty, a copy of
the Bible, with his own name written upon it.  After the
court (which meets on the day after St Colm's) is closed,
the members dine together; and, to prevent that intempe-
rance to which social meetings in such situations are some-
times prone, they spend the evening in some public compe-
tition of dexterity or skill.  Of these, "riding at the ring,"
(an amusement of ancient and warlike origin), is the chief.
Two perpendicular posts are erected on this occasion, with
a cross beam, from which is suspended a small ring: the
competitors are on horseback, each having a pointed rod in
his hand; and he who, at full gallop, passing betwixt the
posts, carries away the ring upon his rod gains the prize.

     PLANTING.
   Within the last 50 years, very extensive plantations have
been made around Dunkeld; and both in point of beauty
added to the landscape, and of value to the soil, there is
ample remuneration made to the proprietor.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The power of the Court, in matters relative to the concerns of the So-
ciety, is supported by the civil Judge, who has on many occasions remitted
the complaints of dissatisfied members to be settled by it.
+At Dunkeld, the standard for the measures is a fixed iron bar, place
on the wall of a house near the market-place, from which a part of the
sheet takes the name of "The Gauge."
