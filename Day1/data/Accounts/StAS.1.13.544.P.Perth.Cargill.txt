   Church and Manse.-It is uncertain when the church
was built, but part of it appears to be very old.  It under-
went a thorough repair in 1754, and is now a tolerably de-
cent commodious place of worship.  It is, however, very
inconveniently situated for the parishioners, as it is placed
at the north-west extremity of the parish, close on the banks
of the river.  The stipend, which is partly victual and part-
ly money, including the glebe, etc. may be worth about
L. 100 a year.  The Crown has the right of patronage.
There is no Dissenting meeting house in the parish, except-
ing a small Roman Catholick Chapel, which is principally
supported by the aids of the Society at Rome, de propagan-
da fide.  The manse was built in 1745, and repaired in
1784.

   Schools.-There are at present 3 schools in this parish.
A parochial, or estabished school at Gallowhill; a cha-
rity school at Strelitz, supported by the Society for propa-
gating Christian Knowledge; and a private school at Wood-
head, without any fixed salary.  The established school-
master, besides a free house and garden, has a legal salary
