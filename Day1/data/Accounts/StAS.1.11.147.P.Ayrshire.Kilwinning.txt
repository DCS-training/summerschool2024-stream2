     of Kilwinning.

A series of facts, thus clearly and fully stated and authen-
ticated, will, by degrees, it is hoped, convince even the most
ignorant and prejudiced of the propriety and necessity of ino-
culation; and, at last, make them readily and cheerfully fall
in with a practice so wonderfully calculated, under GOD, to
preserve life.

   Lakes, Minerals, and Mineral Waters.-There is only one
lake in the parish, called the Ashen-yard Loch.  It abounds in
excellent pikes and perches.-There are quarries of free-stone
in different parts of the parish.  Some of these stones are of a
very fine quality; and are carried in considerable quantities to
Irvine, and to several other places in the neighbourhood.
Lime-stone, of the very best kind, and in very great plenty,
is to be found in almost every quarter and divison of the pa-
rish.-There is one chalybeate spring close by the town; from
the use of which, persons, labouring under nervous complaints,
have received considerable benefit.

   Collieries.-There are three collieries in the parish, viz.
Easter Dowra, belonging to Lord Lisle, which lets at 140 l.
per annum.  At this work from 12 to 16 colliers are em-
ployed.  Laigh Fergus-hill, belonging to the heirs of the late
Mr. M'Dowal, which is at present under lease, for a year, at
100 L.  Monk-greenan, the property of Mr. Bowman of Ash-
grove.  From 4 to 6 men are here usually employed.  It is
let at 10 L. a year.  From the two first of these coal-works,
there is still an exportation to Ireland, from the port of Ir-
vine.  This trade, however, is now very trifling and inconsi-
derable, compared to what it was formerly.

   State of Property.-The valued rent of the parish is 630 L.
Scotch: The real yearly rent is thought to be about 6000 L.
