			V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

	Market-Towns.--Dumfries, our principal market-town, lies up-
on the S. W. of, and is distant about six miles from, the middle of
the parish. There are also occasional markets at Lochmaben and
Lockerby, which lie upon the cast,--the latter about the same dis-
tance as Dumfries, the former three miles nearer. Dumfries and
Lochmaben are our post towns. About four miles of the turn-
pike road between Dumfries and Edinburgh lie within the pa-
rish; upon which a mail-coach passes and repasses daily. Our
parish roads and bridges are in an excellent state of repair.
	Ecclesiastical State.--The church is situated rather inconve-
niently upon the western side of the parish, about a mile from the
one extremity, and five from the other. It was built in 1763, is
a long narrow rectangular house, without either aisle or gallery. It
is in a state of good repair, and affords accommodation for about
400 sitters. The seats are all common, except the few which have
been attached to the principal farms, and those which are occupied
by resident proprietors. The manse was built in 1720, and un-
derwent considerable repairs in 1790, and also in 1800.
	The glebe consists of about seventeen Scotch acres, fences, &c.
