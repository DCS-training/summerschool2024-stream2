have short heads, straight backs, and square ribs.  A prodi-
gious quantity of butter and cheese is annually made here
for sale:  And in the preparation of these articles, the peo-
ple of this parish, as well as the other inhabitants of this
middle district of Ayrshire, are well known to excel the
farmers of every other part of Scotland.

   Agriculture.-Barley and oats are the prevalent articles
of grain-crop.  The lands are carefully subdivided and in-
closed, here and there with hedge-rows of trees and belts of
planting.  Potatoes are the principal article of green crop;
among other varieties of the potatoe, there is particularly
a beautiful long white one, very advantageously in use here.
The gardens afford abundance of pulse and pot-herbs.  The
climate is here, as around this western coast in general, moist,
and subject to frequent rains.  Yet it is sufficiently genial;
for in the middle of September in the year 1795, the har-
vest was more than one half advanced.  The soil is a red-
dish loam; and here and there are considerable strata of
peat-earth.  The culture of turnips, as a crop for forage
and for fallowing, is not yet fully established in this parish;
but begins to be continually more and more adopted.

   Houses, Fuel, etc.-The farm-houses and office-houses are
commodiously arranged in a square, open in front; and ha-
ving, on this side, before the door of the dwelling-house, a
smooth green, a pond of water, and the dunghill.  They
are covered with thatching, and are usually one story in
height.  Sown grasses are universally in use throughout
this parish.  The common proportion between the grass
and the corn in the agriculture of a farm, gives one-third
of the arable ground to the latter; to the former two-thirds.
Lime, for manure, is not indeed found within the parish;
