   The great defalcation of the population in the present year is
obviously attributable to emigration and the enlargement of farms,
also to a failure of the harvest, which induced many young men
and women to seek service, or employment in the south.

   Habits of the People, Popular Customs, &c.-In the habits of
the people there is an obvious and increasing attention to comfort
and cleanliness.  The ordinary dress of the men is of stout home-

exceptions; the majority are decidedly sober people.  If they
have sometimes been charged with indolence, it will be found that
it arises chiefly from the circumstances in which they are placed.
They are capable, when called into activity, of great and laborious
exertion, as well as of patient endurance under privations.
   Their intellectual powers are not, perhaps, in general, much
elevated by reading and education, although, with hardly an ex-
ception, they can all read; but they are endued with great natural
acuteness and sagacity in the management of their own affairs.
If in some instances they are too much disposed to retain a sense
of injury, they at the same time are extremely sensible of, and
