for clearing the mines of water, the largest steam-engine of which
this country can boast.  It was constructed by Claud Girdwood
and Co., Glasgow, at an expense of upwards of L.6000, exclusive
of sinking the pit, &c.  It is of 140 horse power, can work thirteen
strokes per minute, and deliver in that time 889, 779 ale gallons.
A description of it is to be found in a treatise by Mr John Milne,
teacher of architectural and mechanical drawing, Edinburgh, en-
titled A Practical View of the Steam Engine, illustrated by En-
gravings of the largest Engine in Scotland.
  Zoology. -There is little worthy of remark in the zoology of
the parish.  The animals found here are such as are common over
the lowlands. There is no peculiar species of cattle bred.  The
kinds of fish ordinarily caught in the Frith of Forth are the had-
dock, cod, flounder, and whiting.  Mackerel and sole are also oc-
casionally got; the latter, it is believed, might be found in much
greater plenty were proper tackle to be employed.  Salmon are
also caught in small quantities at the mouth of the Esk.
   Botany.-The banks of the Esk furnish a rich field for the bo-
tanist.  The following list comprises most of the plants found in
