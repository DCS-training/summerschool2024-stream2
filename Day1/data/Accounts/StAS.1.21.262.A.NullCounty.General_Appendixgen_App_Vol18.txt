mer tenant, consisting of about 114 acres, at 30s. for each
acre.  Observe, this is not the ground which Mr Ewing has
been highly improving with Glasgow manure from the sham-
bles; but the very lands which, the same tenant formerly pos-
sessed at about 12 s. the acre, less than half the present value.
Mr Ewing is to inclose with double hedges, which circum-
stance Sir John Sinclair will understand, as this mode is fol-
lowed in many parts of the country where improvements
have taken place.
   He also intends, in conspicuous situations, and which in a
high country must have a very fine effect from the adjacent
grounds which lie low, to insert clumps of firs, &c ; and he
means, besides what he has already done, to inclose the
whose of his lower grounds, and the grounds exposed to the
storm with broad belts of planting, &c.
   I have mentioned the above circumstances that Sir John
Sinclair may make any use of them in the publication of the
account, which he shall think necessary.
   I forgot, in the beginning of my letter, to mention a small
eversight.  The origin of the name of this parish, Carmun-
rock, or Carmannock, signifies ' the camp town sounded up-
on the hill of heath.'
   Though Sir John Sinclair is now pleased to order the pub-
lication of this parish, I shall consider it however my duty,
on all occasions, to give him the state of improvement, if any
such shall take place, and if I shall think my observations
worthy of his notice.  I know Sir John Sinclair will kindly
recieve this small tribute of real respect,
