ced age.  Lately there were 6 men living at the same time,
within fifty yards of one another, in the old town of Peebles,
whose ages together amounted to 528 years, and who, several
of them, died near 100 years old.  The people are regular in
their attendance on the institutions of religion, sober, peace-

has tended more to preserve a due observance of the Sabbath,
a reverence of God, and veneration for religion and its ordi-
nances in Scotland, than this, that our holidays are mostly ob-
served with the same religious sanctity as the Sabbath.

   Stipend, Poor, Schools, &c.-The church, which is elegant

Duke of Queensberry, as Earl of March, is patron.  The
poor have no regular support but from the interest of between
400 L. and 500 L. Sterling in the management of the kirk ses-
sion, the collections at the church doors on Sabbath, and the
small sums arising from the use of the pall and hearse, amount-
ing to about 60 L. Sterling yearly:  Besides what the magi-
trates give to indigent persons from the revenues of the town,
