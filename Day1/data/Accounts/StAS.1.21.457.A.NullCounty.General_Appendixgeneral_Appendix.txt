     The Statistical Account.

scarce and dear; and every master must have the art of di-
recting it to good purpose, otherwise he cannot hope to suc-
ceed.

   Wages.-A man servant, by the half year, from 5 L. to 6
guineas.  If married, he has a house, peats, 52 stone oat-
meal, a cow's grass, and from 8 l. to 10 l. a-year.  A day-la-
bourer, in summer, without victuals, 1 s. 8 d. a-day; in win-
ter, 1 s. 2 d.  A woman servant, for half year, from 2 l. to
2 l. 10 s.  In harvest, people snear for potatoes; 8 shearing
days, for the produce of a hundred weight seed potatoes,
dunged and dressed by the farmer in his own land:  This
produce is about 2 carts of new potatoes for 8 days shearing,
the highest wages given in any country.  Women who shear
for money, in harvest, have a guinea for 4 weeks shearing.
By the day, in harvest, they get their victuals and 1 s. or
sometimes more.  Men, in harvest, get 2 l. for 4 weeks shear-
ing, when paid in money.  In summer, the daily wages for
women are less.  Hiring fairs are much frequented:  those
who are to hire wear a green sprig in their hat:  and it is
very seldom that servants will hire in any other place.
   Masons and carpenters have 12 s. a-week; slaters, 15 s.
taylors, 5 s. and their victuals.  A carter has 3 s. 6 d. a-day.
A smith is paid by his customers, in coals and oats, jointly.

   Amusements-We have but one general amusement, that
of curling on the ice:  and the parishioners of Wamphray
take much credit to themselves for their superior skill in this
engaging exercise.  After the play is overs it is usual to
make a common hearty meal upon beef and greens, in the
nearest public house.
