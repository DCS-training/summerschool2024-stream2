last Statistical report was published, immense improvements
have taken place. Many hundred acres of moor-ground have
been reclaimed. The Earl of Seafield gives a bounty of L.5
for each acre thus improved. On the extensive moor grounds
lying on the north and south sides of the turnpike road lead-
ing from Cullen to a little westward of Rannachie, from the
encouragement thus given, the appearance of the face of the land
has been most completely changed: and, in addition to this, many
comfortable and commodious houses have been built, which, with
their neat enclosures, add very much to the beauty of the stir-
rounding bountry.  By the premium thus offered, many industri-
ous and enterprising poor people obtain a decent and respectable
subsistence. The improvers, besides receiving the L.5 for each
acre reclaimed, possess it rent free for five years ; after that period
they pay a rent according to the quality of the ground improved.
Prejudices in favour of old practices are speedily dying away; and
every intelligent and cautious man is anxiously looking around him
to discover what is most conducive to his own interest. Great im-
provements have been made in agriculture, particularly in drain-
ing and turnip-husbandry. Thrashing-mills have been erected
wherever the farms are of any considerable extent, several of which
are driven by water. Much corn is still thrashed with flails. The
people are, in every respect, improved, both as to intelligence,
food, clothing, and lodging. The roads and bridges are kept in
good order, affording an easy aud ready access to markets, and
every part of the surrounding country.
