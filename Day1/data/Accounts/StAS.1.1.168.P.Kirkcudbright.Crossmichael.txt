tle swells, or, as they are called, knows, all of which are arable,
and, when properly dressed, have a fine effect.  Along the
Dee is an extensive and fertile valley.

   Soil, Climate, etc.-The soil is extremely various; such as
loam, meadow, holm, till, gravellish or sandy.  The whole is
remarkable for producing exuberant crops of grain, and a
species of natural grass, which, though not tall, is excellent
pasturage.  A good deal of rain falls in most parts of the west
of Scotland.  There is, however, rather less here than in the 
adjacent parishes, because the high hills which collect the
vapours, and break the clouds, are at a considerable distance.
The air is by no means moist:  Snow seldom lies long; and,
on the whole, this place is as healthy as any in Britain.  Since
the mosses have been drained, the ague, which was the only
prevalent distemper, has quite disappeared.  The two rivers 
which bound its eastern and western extremities, promote a
constant circulation of air, and prevent noxious vapours from
collecting.  The people live not in towns or villages, and
most of them are employed in agriculture, which is favou-
rable at once to health, longevity, and morals.  Within these
20 years, at least 12 persons have died in the lower parts of Gal-
loway, from 100 to 115 years old.  William Marshal, a tinker
in this place, is now 118.  He might pass for a man of 60.
His faculties are unimpaired, and he walks through the coun-
try with ease.  One thing must here be stated as highly per-
nicious.  The advanced duties on malt have almost entirely
abolished the practice of brewing.  Ale-houses no longer ex-
ist; but dram-houses have been substituted in their place,
which the cheapness of whisky, and the contraband trade in
foreign spirits carried on in this country, tempt the people
to frequent too much.
