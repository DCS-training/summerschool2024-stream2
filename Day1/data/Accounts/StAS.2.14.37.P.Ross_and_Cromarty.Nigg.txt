late Mrs Gair of Nigg. The beritors have of late been induced
to give L. 30 a-year to the poor. There seems no indisposition
on the part of the poor to take, There kirk-seesion does not take
any concern in the division of what is called the poor's money.
    Fair.-The only fair in the parish is Hugh's Fair, held in, November,
for general purposes. It. is dying away very fast.
   Inns.-There are 3 small inns, which are in many cases an accommodation
to travellers; but otherwise they are no blessing.
   FUEL.--Coals from Newcastle are the principal fuel for the, more
opulent and the farm-servants. But whins and  broom, aod suuch
other fire-wood as can be found, constitute the fuel of the greater
part of the population. Cools a cost about ls. per imperial barrel,
and their quality is seldom good.

There has been a great improvement on the comfort of the houses,
and in the dress and habits of the people. 3d, A, great many
strangers have taken up their abode here, while many former residenters
have vanished. 4th, The farms are now on a different plan
from that on which they formerly were, and the system of farming
has been quite changed.
