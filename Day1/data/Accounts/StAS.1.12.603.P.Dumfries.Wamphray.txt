winding banks of this rivulet, in a deep and woody recess, is
singularly romantick.

   Climate, etc.-More rain falls in this country, than in
many other parts of Scotland.  The best built walls, where
exposed to the S., become damp within.  The air therefore
must be moist, but the longevity of the people, and the in-
frequency of epidemical distempers, sufficiently prove that it
is a healthy district.  The water is very pure.  The soil,
when it is cultivated, is in some places clayey, in others gra-
velly.  There is marl of various kinds; but, on account of
the difficulty of digging it out, and some other circumstances,
it has bitherto been little used.  Attempts have been made,
but without success, to find coal and lead.

   Population.-The number of the people in 1755, according
to Dr. Webster's report, was 458.  The population of the
parish seems to have been anciently greater than at present.
One farmer now possesses what was occupied 60 years ago by
10 or 12 tenants.  The population, however, has increased
of late, and now amounts to 487:  males 235; females 252.
Inhabited houses 90.  Number to each inhabited house al-
most 5 1/2.  Of births, deaths, and marriages, there has been
no register kept for many years past.  There is now living,
one person aged 96, one 92, one 89, three or four 86 and
upwards.  A woman who died about 12 years ago, was ge-
nerally believed, in the neighbourhood, to be 113 years old.
There are 3 masons, 2 joiners, 4 tailors, 9 weavers, 2 smiths.
2 shoemakers, 1 surgeon.

   Heritors, Stipend, etc.-The number of heritors is 5.  Two
of them reside in the parish.  The Earl of hopetoun is prin-
cipal heritor and patron.  The stipend is about 751., includ-
