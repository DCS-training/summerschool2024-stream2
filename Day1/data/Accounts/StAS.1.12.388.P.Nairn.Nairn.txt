   Fishings, Boats, etc.-The salmon fishing on the water of
Nairn is the property of Lord Findlater, and of Mr. Davidson 
of Cantray; and also a stell fishing at the mouth of the river. 
These fishings are let to tacksmen (36 L. each), two in num-
ber, who drag or draw the river and stell fishings alternately, 
or day about.  James Brodie, Esq. of Brodie, has a stell fish-
ing on the E. side of the river mouth.  The greatest part of 
the salmon caught is this parish is carried to Findhorn, and 
sold there to a company of merchants from Aberdeen, who 
cure and export it either to the London or a foreign market. 
There are 6 fishing boats in the town, and 2 in the country 
part of the parish, in each of which about 7 men are employ-
ed.  Formerly there were from 10 to 12 boats; but on ac-
count of greater encouragement, several of the fishermen, par-
ticularly young lads, have removed to other parts of the 
kingdom.  Haddocks, skate, cod, flounders, and some ling, 
&c. are caught in the Murray Frith.  Some herrings are like-
wife, in the season, found on the coast; but for this last spe-
cies of fish, the fishermen must frequently go as far to the W.
as the Ferry of Kessock, and even to Beauly.  In this Frith, 
fish of all kinds are much scarcer since 1782; previous to 
that year, they were caught in abundance, just opposite 
to the town, but since that period, the seamen are some-
times obliged to go to coasts of Sutherland and Caithness 
for them *.

*Prices of Provisions, Labour, etc.-Within these 30 years back, the price 
of provisions has risen almost beyond belief.  Most articles are tripled in value,
many quadrupled, and some far exceed that proportion.  Mutton, beef, and 
pork, which, at the forementioned period, seldom drew more than 1 penny a
