   Regular annual assessments for the support of the poor were
first had recourse to in 1797.  For the first ten years, the average
amount was L.21; for the next ten, L.52; and for the third, end-
ing with 1827, L.106. During this period, the population had
doubled, whereas the assessment had increased five-fold. In
1826, one of L.120 had been imposed when the present incum-
bent entered on his duties; and, impressed with the evils which
a compulsory provision has a tendency to produce, especially to the
poor themselves, he proposed to bring about such a state of things
as might materially abate the evil. In this he has been successful.
The year after, only L.80 were required, and in the two following
L.60 each; while, during these four years, a balance of L.50
had accumulated in the kirk-treasurer's hands. About the same
time, payment was received of a legacy by Miss Jane Wauchope
for the behoof of the poor, which, being left to their discretion,
the session resolved should be applied to educational purposes.
Next year the assessment was L.50, and then it was proposed to
the heritors that it should be discontinued, provided those non-
resident would consent to give a voluntary contribution in lieu of
the collections, that would have been received, had they resided on
their properties and attended worship at the parish church. This
was at once assented to, and the amount they agreed to give was
equal to their proportion of an assessment of L.50 per annum.
Colonel Wauchope, the only resident heritor, increased his in the
same proportion, so that the collections, which, in 1831, amount-
ed to L.45, 8s.10 1/2d. rose, in 1832, the first year of the new ar-
rangement, to L.85, 19s. 6 1/4d. It was stipulated also, on proposing
this change, that L.100 should be deposited with the session to
meet extraordinary contingencies that might occur, such as a
pauper lunatic to be maintained in a place of confinement, which
occassions at once a large addition to the expenditure; so that,
with the legacy and saving of L.50 above mentioned, the session
has L.250 of capital.
   Among the measures of amelioration that have been adopted,
an Infant school bas been established, as peculiarly suited to the
circumstances of the population. The parents, to their credit,
have very generally availed themselves of it; and, towards the
fitting up of the school and salary of the teacher, there has been
