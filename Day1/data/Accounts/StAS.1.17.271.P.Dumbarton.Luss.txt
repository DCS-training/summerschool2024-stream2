some time before they are habituated to their new situation,
and thrive in it.  When a man takes a sheep farm, there-
fore, he endeavours, if possible, to purchase from the out-
going tenant the stock of sheep upon it, which he reckons
at the rate of at least 2 s. a head more valuable to him than
to any other.
   Though the tenants are now more comfortably lodged
than they once were, there is still, in that respect, room for
improvement.  In a country which abounds so much with
slates, it may appear surprising that so few of the houses
should be covered with them, though there can be no doubt,
but in the issue, they would be found less expensive than
any thatch which could be used.  The great obstacle to the
use of them for that purpose, at present, is the expence of
the timber required.  That obstacle, it is hoped, will in
time be removed.  When the extensive and thriving plan-
tations, in different parts of the country, have grown up,
timber will be more easily got.
   All these improvements, however, are more wanted in
many other parts than here, where some of them have al-
ready taken place.  Within there 26 years, above 4000 l.
Sterling have been laid out upon the estate of Luss alone, in
inclosing the woods and arable grounds with sufficient stone
dykes and other fences, and in planting; not to speak of the
sums expended upon other improvements.  Within the
same space of time, near 100 acres of waste land have been
brought into tillage, and now produce tolerable crops.
