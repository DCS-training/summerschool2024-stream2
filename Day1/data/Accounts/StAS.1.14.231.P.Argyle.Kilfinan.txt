   Soil and Surface.-Any variety that is to be found in
the soil of this parish, is evidently the natural conse-
quence of different situations.  In some few flats, out of
the reach of running waters, and not far distant from
the sea, yet so far as not to have ever been overflown by
it, is to be seen a fine black mould lying upon a gravel
bed, not deep, but abundantly fertile, and when pro-
perly laid out, produces excellent grass.  In some low
flats, near the level of the sea, and amd in all flat valleys,
where running waters have, in the progress of time,
traversed the ground by shifting their course (which
in this country they continually do where they run 
through arable land), the soil is light and channelly, re-
quires manure very frequently, but gives a sure and
fertile, though not a very heavy crop.  Near tha S.
point of the parish is to be found, in a few places, a
thin stratum of black clay covering a gravelly bottom,
and gives a crop light or heavy, accroding as it is deep
and dry, or light and sour, but never ripens early.  All 
the inland farms are cold and bleak, not so fit either for
pasturage or tillage as those upon the coast.  The crops
upon them are generally as heavy, but not near so fer-
tile, and are always considerably later in ripening than
those upon the low grounds.  All ground upon a decli-
vity (or what is commonly called hanging ground), is
very poor soil, the substance being washed out of it by
the rains.
   The surface is rugged, and the shore equally so, being
all rocky, a few bays excepted; yet it produces little
sea-weed for kelp.  The only kelp which the present
incumbent ever heard of being made in the parish, is a 
little that is yearly manufactured about the S. point,
