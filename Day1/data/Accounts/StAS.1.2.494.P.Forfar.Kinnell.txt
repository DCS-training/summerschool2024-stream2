     Statistical Account

this place, and that a man, of the name of Irons, was slain in
the pursuit.  On account of his extraordinary size, his boot
and spur were taken off, and hung up in an aisle adjoining to
this church, belonging to the family of Airly.  The boot, in a
course of years, would fall down and perish; but the spur still
remains on the wall, covered with rust.  It measures 8 inches
in length, and 44 in breadth, and the rowel is as large as a
crown piece.
   In 1790, a boy, going from school, found, under a bit of
state, a considerable number of silver pennies; some of them
were in good preservation, considering how long they have
been under ground, and have the following inscription, Ed.
R. Angl. Dns. Hyb.  The reverse is, on some of them, Civitas
London. on others, Civitas Cantor, or Civitas Dublinensis.

   Miscellaneous Observations-The reads are tolerable.-
The statute-labour is sometimes exacted in kind, and sometimes
commuted.  There are no stone bridges in the parish, no
turnpikes, no services of any consequence; no post-office.  The
nearest is Aberbrothock, about 4 miles distant.-No peat,
some bad turs; but plenty of coal, from Aberbrothock, for 
6 s the boll, which is 70 stones weight.

   General Character.-The people are fober, regular, and
industrious.  No emigrations, no banishments, no murders
no suicides in the memory of the oldest.  There are two ale
houses in the parish, which have no bad effects on their mo-
rals.  There is a considerable alteration to the better, within 
these 20 years, in dress, manner of living, houses, etc.
