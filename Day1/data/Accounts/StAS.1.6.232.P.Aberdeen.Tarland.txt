     Statistical Account

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-The number of poor who receive
support from the parish funds may be from 16 to 20.  There
are no funds or mortifications for their support, but the daily
collections in the churches, which may, at an average, amount
to 20 d. or 2 s. every sabbath, exclusive of the collections on a
communion occasion, which commonly amount to about L. 3
sterling.-There is nothing remarkable in the characters or
dispositions of the people.  They are generally of the ordinary
size; and not at all deficient in hospitality.-Carts are pretty
generally used both in husbandry and by carriers.-Tarland,
it is believed, would be a very proper place for a linen manu-
facture, as there is good accommodation for a bleachfield, the
water being very soft, and fit for bleaching; and now that there
is a lint-mill erected by the Earl of Aboyne in the neighbour-
ing parish of Coul, there is a sort of spirit for raising lint be-
ginning to appear among the inhabitants of Cromar; and, if
this was encouraged, it might be of great advantage to the coun-
try.  It might also be of service, to have a public distillery e-
rected at or near Tarland, as the country yields a great deal of
good bear, weighing from 18 to 22 stone per boll.  But as there
are no residing heritors in the country, little attention is paid
to the benefit or improvement of it.-By the statute-labour,
which is exacted in kind, the roads, in the parish are put and
kept in pretty good repair.
