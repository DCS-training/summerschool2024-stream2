These he prefers to every other kind.  He thinks that
they fatten much sooner than the black-faced.  He is much
inclined to think that the same field will fatten as many of
the one kind as of the other; and he is convinced, that the
quantity of mutton produced on the acre is certainly at least
25 per cent. in favour of the poled sheep.  Besides, as his
farm is partly corn, and partly grass, the poled sheep are
so quiet, and so little disposed to ramble, that they are in
every respect preferable for such farms to the black-faced,
who are so wild that no sense can keep them within bounds;
consequently, the loss which may be sustained, from their
rambling disposition upon such a farm, is beyond all calcu-
lation.  But the sheep kept for gentlemens families are the
black-faced wedders, brought from the Highlands at four
years old, if they can be had.  The thrive well; and
when fed, weigh from 16 to 20 lb. per quarter, and are ex-
cellent mutton.  There also some Dorsetshire ewes for
early lambs, which have been sold in Dundee market,
in Januayr and February, at a guinea and 20 s. each.

   Calves.-Calves are fed in this parish, and particularly
at Castle-Huntly, for veal, fully as good as any in England.
They are fed in a box, which is made of any coarse boards,
4 1/2 or 5 feet long, 4 or 4 1/2 high, and about 2 feet wide, in
proportion to the breed to be fed.  The boards of which
the box is made, are to be put so close to one another, as to
let in sufficient air, but no more, as the exclusion of
light may be one essential part of the process.  It stands up-
on 4 feet; at one end about 4 inches high; and the other 2
inches; which, with small holes in the bottom, drains it of
all wetness.  But, to make it still more comfortable, the
bottom should be covered with straw or hay, which should
be changed at least twice a week.  The calf is put into this
box when new dropped, or as soon after as possible; and
