ning through a deep and narrow glen*.  The parish is ex-
tensive; of an irregular form; at an average it may be
reckoned 8 miles in length from S. to N. and 5 in breadth
from E to W.  It is bounded by the parishes of Beath,
Dagety, and Inverkeithing on the E.; of Carnock and 
Torryburn on the W; of Cliesh and Saline on the N.; and
on the S. by the frith of Forth.  The air in general is dry
and salubrious, but there is a very preceptible difference as 
to climate in the parish, being much milder in the southern
part, which slopes gently to the sea, than towards the N.
where the ground continues to rife, and is more hilly and
exposed.  The parish contains a variety of soils:  In gene-
ral towards the S. of the town, called the laigh land, the
soil is fertile, mostly in tillage, and in many places in a 
state of high cultivation; towards the N. the soil is greatly
interior in quality, in many places covered with heath, and 
containing mosses of considerable extent, though many spots
are well cultivated, yet the land in general is chiefly adapt-
ed to pasturage.

   Borough, Prospect, Constitution, etc.-Dunfermline is a
Royal Borough, the seat of the Presbytery, and one of the 
most considerable manufacturing towns in Fife.  It is 3 miles 
from the sea, and about 190 feet above its level; the great-
er part of the town is situated on a hill or rifing ground,
having a pretty bold declivity towards the S.; the ground,
however, soon slattens, so that what is called the Nether

*The situation must have accorded still more exactly with the name, if 
we suppose, as seems highly probable, that Dunfermline owes its appella-
tion to a little peninsulated hill situated in the glen; from this hill the 
borough has borrowed its arms; it is of small circumference, but of con-
siderable height, very rugged and steep towards the N. and appears to
have been anciently a place of strength; a tower built upon it was the
residence of Malcolm Canmore.
