the plain below, the houses and buildings will appear inter-
mixed with trees, masts, and fails, while no river or water
is to be seen.  From Port Dundas, the Company have
formed a junction with a canal, which runs 12 miles to the
east, to the collieries in the parishes of Monkland, and
which bids fair in time to bring a considerable addition to
their revenue.  This great undertaking, which was 22
years in finishing, was one of the most arduous to execute
in the kingdom.  In its course, it passes over rocks, preci-

400 feet long, and 65 feet deep; and, considering the
length, the width, and the weight of water it has to sustain,
may be justly reckoned, the most stupenduous of its kind,
in the world.  This great inland navigation is supplied
with water by seven reservoirs, covering 409 acres of
ground, and containing 12,679 lock fulls of water; and
when the increase of the trade shall require, the Company
have it in their power to add two other reservoirs, capable
of containing 15,958 lock fulls more.
   The affairs of this Company were originally under the

the other at Edinburgh; each of which met quarterly, and
the first of these chose a Committee of Management annu-

each other, and their orders to the Committee of Manage-
ment being sometimes contradictory, an act of Parliament
was passed, in the year 1787, forming a new constitution;
whereby the direction of the Company was placed in a
