use of bread made from wheat is now very general.  It
may be safely said, that tea is used in three fourths of the

consumed, is at present double what it was 30 years ago*.

*In the year 1770, a young rook, commonly called a crow in Scot-
land, was taken out of a nest upon a tree at Struthers; the bird was per-
fectly white, without one black feather; the beak, legs and claws were
also white; it was tamed, and lived about two years in Struthers house.
In voice, manner of living, and feeding, it differed not from other birds
of the same species.

   In the year 1788, a white swallow was seen by many persons, at diffe-
rent times, through the whole of the summer season, flying about the
Tower of Scotstarvet in the west end of the parish.  Both of the above
particulars sell under the immediate observation of the compiler of this
statistical account.
