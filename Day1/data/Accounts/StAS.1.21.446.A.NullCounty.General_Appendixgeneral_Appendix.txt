strata; which are, mostly found, under soil of this colour, to
be either till, or freestone, of the same appearance.
   3dly, Meadow ground, generally covering a light coloured
clay, and bearing good crops of coarse hay, with a sole of
finer grass under it.
   I do not mention certain spots of gravelly soil, covered with
short heath, as a species by itself, because this is obviously a
ruined soil, bared by floods, or peeled by the slaughter spade,
or otherwise robbed of its richness.
   There is peat moss in the low part of the parish of differ-
ent sorts, but mostly light or flowy.  There is also a species
on the hill tops; but this article is not sufficient; we are
obliged to the parish of Johnston for a supply, and must fre-

   The subsoil, in the low grounds, is generally gravel or

Small stones mingle in the soil; but large surface stones are

   Produce.-Considerable quantities of crop are made; but
the staple is in short sheep and black cattle.  The sheep are
ewe and lamb stocks, of the black faced kind, not very hea-

without horns, and handsome; but of little use for a dairy,

yet.  Sown grass is an article of some importance.  Turnips
are raised on a small scale.  But potatoes are planted to a great
