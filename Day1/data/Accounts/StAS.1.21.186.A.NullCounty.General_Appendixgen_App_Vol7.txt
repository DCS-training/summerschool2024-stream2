work with lighter ploughs, and fewer cattle;-with some
new instruments of husbandry, and others improved.
   A few more substantial tenants, whose grounds lie near
Aberdeen, by driving dung from that place, along with other
means, have brought them to a high state of cultivation.-
From an exchange in respect to half of the glebe, for accom-
modation of a road, something was necessary to be done.
The exchanged land is drained, where needful; freed from
stones, inclosed, and improved.  In a marshy part of the
other half of the glebe, drains have been filled, and the sur-
face made up by several hundred cart-loads of stones and
earth.-Mr Robert Davidson, feuer of Balnagask, has his
principal fields in great heart, producing, in particular, valua-

and is making progress in clearing, manuring, and inclosing
his poorer and more waste lands.-Mr Robert Smith, mason,
lately feuer of North Loirstoun, did a great deal in different
ways of improving both the wet and the dry ground; and
built an excellent steading, inclosing part of the farm with
substantial stone dykes.  The improvement is carrying on,
under the present proprietor; and in a little time four or five
thousand ells of stone fence, inclosing above a hundred acres
of arable ground, laid out in parks, where one was not be-
fore, will be completed.-Captain Charles Adamson im-
proves with spirit his feu, both meliorating the arable land,
and gaining on the moor.-Mr Colin Innes, surveyor of land,
who possesses the largest farm of Mr Menzies of Pitfoddels,
besides the usual modes of improvement, has covered six or
seven acres of light black soil with clay.  It renders the
ground firmer to support a crop from lodging, more retentive
of clover, and more productive.  He also first introduced
here, and first carried to any extent, the bringing in waste
moor grounds without trenching, by the plough.  After
