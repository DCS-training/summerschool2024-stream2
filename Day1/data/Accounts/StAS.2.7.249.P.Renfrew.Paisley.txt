   Since the above census was taken, there has been an increase
in both the Abbey and town of Paisley,The Census taken about
two years ago, and which we have adopted under the ecclesiastical
head, makes the population of the Abbey 26,177, and of the Town
31,703,-of the whole 57,880.  But since that period the increase,
we have reason to believe, has been very rapid, as a number of ad-
ditional houses have been built, both in the town and suburbs of
Paisley, and in the village of Johnston and its neighbourhood.  At
present the public works in Paisley are on the increase, and there
is a large mill about to be erected at Johnston, which, it is said,
will give employment to not fewer than 200 individuals, so that
when we take into consideration, not only the persons who will be
actually employed at all these works, but also their families, and the
victual-dealers and clothiers required to provide the necessaries of
life to this additional population, we may anticipate an increase in
the number of the inhabitants, on a scale equal to, if not greater
than any we have yet had occasion to record.
   The average number in each family in the Abbey parish is 4.7;
in the town 4.4 ; in both taken together 4.6.  The number
in each family of the town and village population, however,
is very different from that of the country.  Thus, of the west-
ern part of the parish, including Johnston and Elderslie, the
number of families in the villages is 1593, and the population
7434, making the average number in each family 4.6: whereas
the number of families in the country locality of that quarter is
53, and the population 370, giving an average of 7, or nearly so, to
