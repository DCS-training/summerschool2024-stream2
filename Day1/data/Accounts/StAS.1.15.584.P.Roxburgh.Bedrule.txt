   It is for reasons such as these, and not from a want of de-
sire on the part of the people and minister of Bedrule, to have
every thing put on a legal footing, that the church-yard wall
is in great disrepair, that the gate is so broken down and ne-
glected, as not to prevent the intrusion of swine, and there-
by to alarm the people in the neighbourhood for the graves
of their deceased relations; that the church bell, which has

but I cannot find, that he has acted any thing contrary to my interest."  And,
therefore, notwithstanding, his confessed humanity, he neither called him to
account, nor dismissed him his service, far less did he give him orders to
repair the injuries done.  When we have said thus much, we submit
the weight and importance of our observations, with great deference, to the
penetrating eye of an impartial public, particularly to those in the senate
and judgment-seat, whom our excellent Constitution has happily render-
ed independent and free.  And, the more plainly, because, we are satisfied,
that the best support of any nation, the strongest pillars of any government,
are, That the people's morals be found, that their manners be civil, that their
religion be liberal, that the laws, that justice, be equally easy and accessible to
all.
