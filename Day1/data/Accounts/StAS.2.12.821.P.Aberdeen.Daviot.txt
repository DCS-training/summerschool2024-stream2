   for the relief of the poor and distressed over the whole of their
bounds, appointing the interest thereof to be paid in rotation to
the several kirk-sessions of the synod, the lowest allowance to
any kirk-session being L. 20. In general, our poor have shown
great unwillingness to accept parochial relief. This feeling is now,
however, less prevalent than formerly.

                            PARISH OF DAVIOT.

                PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

                   THE REV. THOMAS BURNETT, MINISTER.

                   I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-DAVIOT,-in Keith's Catalogue of Scottish Bishops
spelled also Davot,-may perhaps be a modification of the Gaelic
Dabhoch, pronounced Davoch, of which, in a dictionary of this
language, is given the following account : "Dabhoch-oich, sub.
fem., a farm that keeps 60 cows : Ager sexaginta boves pas-
cens. Davata. Law Lat.-In the Hebrides a Davoch of land is
a farm adequate to the pasture of 320 cows. Scot. Dawache of
land."
   Extent, &c.-Its average length is about 3 miles, and its average
breadth about 2. It is bounded by the parish of Fyvie on the
north; the parishes of Fyvie and Meldrum on the east; the pa-
rishes of Bourtie and Chapel of Garioch on the south ; and by
the parish of Rayne on the west.
   Two quoad sacra annexations were made to Daviot by act of
Assembly in the end of the seventeenth century, viz. part of the
parish of Fyvie lying on the north-east, and part of the parish of
Chapel of Garioch on the south, so that ecclesiastically its extent
of surface is now about 8 1/4 square miles.
   Topographical Appearances.-A gently undulated ridge passes
through the middle, and traverses nearly the whole length of the
parish from north to south, and two shorter lateral ridges of infe-
rior elevation, one on each side, slightly undulated also, complete
the figure of the parish.
