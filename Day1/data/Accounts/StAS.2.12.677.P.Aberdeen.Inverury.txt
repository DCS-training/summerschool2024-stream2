                      PARISH OF INVERURY.

            PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

               THE REV. ROBERT LESSEL, MINISTER.

               I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Situation. &c.-INVERURY, or, as it was sometimes formerly
written, Ennerurie, lies between the Don and Ury, and, extend-
ing to the confluence of these rivers, thence derives its name.  It
is bounded on the west, by Chapel of Garioch; on the south, by
the Don; and on the north and east, by the Ury.  Its length
from east to west is nearly 4, its breadth from north to south some-
thing more than 2 English miles; and it contains fully 5100 im-
perial acres.
   Topographical Appearances.-The vale of Inverury, in which
the town stands, and the haughs and lower grounds along the ri-
ver's side, embrace about 1000 acres of light fertile loam incum-
bent chiefly on sand.  The ground gradually rises towards the
west, and terminates in three hills within the parish, almost equi-
distant from each other, and separated by straths or valleys; that
on the south is called the hill of Manar, the middle hill is named
Knockinglew, that on the north the hill of Drimmies.

                         II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
    Perhaps the first mention made of Inverury is in the short nar-
rative of King Eth.  It is noticed in a charter, of date about 1178,
by David Earl of Huntingdon, brother of King William the Lyon.
By this charter he conveys to the rich Abbey of Lindores, "ec-
clesiam de Fintrichi (Fintray) cum omnibus pertinentiis suis; et
ecelesiam de Inveruriu cum capella de Monkegin et omnibus
aliis pertinentiis suis; et ecelesiam de Durnach (Durns) et ec-
clesiam de Prame (Premnay) et ecclesiam de Inchemabarim
(Insch) et ecclesiam de Culsamuel (Culsamond) cum terris at de-
cimis," &c. (Archaeologia, Vol. xiii. p. 177.)  These churches
came into the hands of Earl David, then probably the richest Lord
in Britain, as part of the Lordship of the Garioch conferred on
