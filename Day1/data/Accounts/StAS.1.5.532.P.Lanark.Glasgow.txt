   April 7. 1653.  A most affecting and even elegant repre-
sentation to the public, was made by the citizens of Glas-

fire on the 17th June 1652, which had consumed one third
part of their city, consisting of the dwellings of almost

loss is estimated at L. 100,000*.

above its usuallevel, by which all the lower part of the town
was laid under water, and many of the inhabitants obliged
to be carried out of their houses in boats.  This flood was
18 inches higher than in 1712, at which time it was higher

There is also plenty of clays proper for making bricks,
tiles, and the common kinds of pottery, but none of the
finer kinds.-The fossil to which this city owes it greatest
advantages is COAL, which is found in great abundance in
