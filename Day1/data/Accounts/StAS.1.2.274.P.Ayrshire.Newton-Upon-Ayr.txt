past, a considerable premium from the Trustees of the
fisheries, for his diligence and success.-Several go to the
herring busses, in the West Highlands, and Islands; but
the two last years were remarkably unfavourable, so that they
were great losers by the expedition.  The number of hands
employed at sea, from this parish, exclusive of the salmon,
the seal, and white fishing, amounts to 50; some of whom,
at one season of the year, go abroad in trading vessels, and
at another, are engaged in the herring fishery.

   Diseses.-We shall conclude this account with a few
remarks on the health of the inhabitants.-Though the
grounds of the parish ly low, yet the air is pure and healthy;
owing to the vicinity of the sea, and the dry and sandy bot-
tom of the soil.  No epidemical disorders are peculiar to the
inhabitants; and infectious diseases seldom prevail to any
great height.  It is, however, affirmed by some of the
medical department, that the air is too pure for constitu-
tions inclining to a consumptive habit;-few of the natives
of the place, however, fall a sacrifice to that distemper.-
The health of the inhabitants is much injured by the too
frequent use of spirituous liquors.  And it would be advan-
tageous both to their health and morals, if there were few-
er alehouses.  Though the town is of small extent, it is
computed, that there are 12 publichouses, besides several places
where spirituous liquors are sold.  On the whole, however,
though the inhabitants, in general, do not arrive at extreme
old age, there are few places, where the inestimable blessing
of health is enjoyed to a greater degree; so that this part of
the country has, with some justice, been called the Montpe-
lier of Scotland.
