overcome, by the public spirited exertions of Mr. SPIERS and
Mr. DUNMORE.  The gentleman last mentioned, has formed,
as it were, a new creation on the water of Endriek, and given
life and spirit to a country which, 4 years ago, seemed con-
demned to perpetual dullness; having, in that apace, brought
from different parts of the country, to the neighbouring pa-
rishes of Balsron and Killearn, no fewer than 1100 persons.
Both these gentlemen, with much private expence, obtained
an act of parliament for a new district of roads, in the western
parts of Stirlingshire; and, with a promptitude of execution,
equal to their zeal in moving the measure, have furnished this
part of the country with as good roads as any part of Scot-
land.  The Craw Road, a mile in length and upwards, which
was formerly 1 foot of accent in 7, and in some places 1 foot
in 5, is now reduced to 1 foot in 20, in the steepest place.
This line of road reaches from Glasgow through Fintry, and
joins the military road between Stirling and Dumbarton, about
6 miles to the N. of this place.  The county road to the W.
is also now put into a state of repair; so that, from being the
most difficult of access, Fintry is now easily accessible on all
sides.-The bridges, on this line of road are numerous, and
add very much to the ease of the communication; as the deep
ravines formed by the mountain streams, which were former-
ly very difficult to pass, are all arched over, and filled up to
the level of the adjacent banks.  The bridge over the End-
rick consists of 4 arches, 2 of which are 26 feet wide, and the
other two 12 feet each.  The bridge on the old line of road,
about a mile farther up the river, consists of one beautiful
arch of 47 feet wide, and another of 15 feet.

   Rivers, Fish, etc.-The Endrick has its source in the hill of Fin-
on the northern side of the parish.  It runs E. a little way,
takes a sudden turn to the S., forming the eastern boundary
