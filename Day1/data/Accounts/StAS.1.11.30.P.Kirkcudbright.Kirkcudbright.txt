     Statistical Account

of the sea is observable along the whole coast, yet it is more
particularly remarkable around St. Mary's Isle.  The sea, in
former times, had slowed, not only round the whole isle,
but had also covered at least one half of all that is now green,
at every flux of the tide.  The former line of high water
can be traced with great accuracy, by the large shell banks,
that have been lately discovered all along the east side of the
peninsula.  The west side is high ground, defended by a bor-
der of rocks.
