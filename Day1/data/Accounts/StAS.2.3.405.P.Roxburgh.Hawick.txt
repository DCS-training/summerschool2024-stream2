fluctuation, the woollen manufacture has been progressively advan-
cing.  More especially within the last few years, lame additions
have been made to almost all the mills which had previously been
established, several new erections also have been completed on a
very large scale, and at present there are 11 extensive factories,
one of which is driven by steam, and the others by water power,
besides various buildings of considerable extent for the operation
of stocking frames.  The kind of machinery made use of in the
mills, consists generally of the common engines for teazing, scrib-
bling, carding, and spinning, together with doubling and twisting
machines, vhich are worked by hand; and the principal articles,
manufactured are yarns, under clothing, flannels, plaiding, shawls,
tartans, druggets, cloths of various descriptions, lamb's wool
hosiery of the finest texture, and blankets, both according to the
English. and Scotch mode of manufacture.  From returns with
which we have been favoured by some of the leading manufac-
turers, we have constructed the following table, which may give a
tolerable idea of the state of manufactures in this place for the
year 1838.

<TABLE>

   Value of property employed in manufacture L. 101,861 0 0
   Annual amount of wages,                       48,726 0 0
   Quantity of yarn manufactured,                       854,462 lbs.
   Annual consumption of wool,                          108,162 stones.
   Quantity of soap consumed,                           102,899 lbs.
   Number of stockings made,                           1049,676 pairs
   Articles of under clothing,                           12,552
   Number of operatives,                                    1788
   Number of stocking-frames,                               1209
   Number of weaving-looms,                                  226

  In addition to the operatives specified  in  the preceding tables,
it way be mentioned, that a considerable number of females ob-
tain regular employment in sewing stockings; but as these are ge-
nerally engaged not by the proprietors of the factories, but by the
stocking-makers, it is difficult to ascertain the exact number.  It
may also be noticed, that the manufacturers are in the practice of
giving employment to weavers and stocking-makers in almost every.
parish in the district to the extent of at least twenty or thirty miles
from the town.  Besides, there are a good many smiths, carpenters
masons, mill-wrights, and needle-makers, who are mainly if not di-
rectly dependent on this branch of commercial enterprize, and of
course its influence, both in affording the means of subsistdnce
and in the circulation  of capital, is much more extensive than is
made to appear from  the foregoing details.
  In closing our remarks on this subject, we cannot help remark-
