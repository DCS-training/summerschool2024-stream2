works on the south side of Tranent, the length being about three
miles.
   A harbour was erected by the same gentlemen in 1835, at a
natural basin on the west side of the village of Cockenzie, for the
purpose of shipping coal. The cost amounted to about L. 6000,
and the work was done in the most substantial manner, from a
plan by Mr Robert Stevenson, civil-engineer. This harbour has
16 feet depth of water in spring tides, and 10 in neap tides; it is
easy of access, and affords complete shelter to vessels; while, dur-
ing stormy weather, it is most advantageous to the fishermen, who are
thus enabled to run for a place of safety, instead of the exposed
beach, formerly their only refuge.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church has been rebuilt since
the last Statistical Account, a new one having been erected in
1800. The situation is sufficiently convenient for the greater part of
the population, the distance from the extremities of the parish be-
ing at no place more than two miles and a-half. But the sittings
having been divided amongst the heritors according to their valued
rents, the great proportion of the inhabitants of the villages had
no legal right to church accommodation. The only mortifications
belonging to the parish are, the interest of L. 100, left by Lord
Bankton, and L. 2 from Dr Schaw's Hospital at Preston. The
church contains 888 sittings, of which about 20 are free. The
manse was built in 1781, but has undergone several additions and
repairs. The extent of the glebe is about six acres Scots, with
about an acre of moorland: and it may be valued at about L. 4 per
Scots acre.
   The augmentation granted in 1831 raised the stipend to 18
chalders of victual, but the teinds being exhausted, the amount
allocated was 47 bolls, 1 firlot, 3 pecks, 0 2/3 lippies of wheat; 81
bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, 3 lippies of bear; 149 bolls, 1 firlot, 2
pecks, 1 lippies of oats; L. 59, 16s. 8d. Scots money; which at
the fiars prices of that year amounted to L. 349, 6s. 10 1/4 d. Ster-
ling, being a deficiency of the modified stipend to the extent of
L. 21, 17s. 1 3/4 d.
   In the village of Cockenzie, a new church was, in 1838, completed
by private subscription, aided by the General Assembly's Church
Extension Committee; by the East Lothian Church Extension So-
ciety, and by L. 150 raised by the Rev. A. Forman of Innerwick.
It contains 450 sittings, and is built so as to admit of galleries being
afterwards added. The total expense of this church was about
