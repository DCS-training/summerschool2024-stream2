     of Kingarth

   Climate-This parish, though damp, is mild and tempe-
rate, and very healthy, owing probably to the saline particles
impregnating the air, and the dry sandy soil of the parish.
There are no epidemical diseases in the parish.  The only
distemper is the rheumatism; but it is not frequent.  There
are many instances of longevity in the parish.  Three men
died this winter, one 94, each of the other two 84 years
old.

   Language and Character.-Most of the natives speak English
very well; although, in conversing with one another, they
seem to be fond of the Gaelic, their mother tongue, which
chiefly prevails among to old people, and may have been an
hindrance to the more easy and more ready introduction of
new methods of improvements in the parish.  They are a so-
ber, peaceable, and charitable people.

   Patron, Heritors, and Stipend, etc.-The Earl of Bute is
patron, and almost sole proprietor of the parish.  There are
only four heritors of small property, not amounting to L. 200
per annum.  The stipend consists of 78 bolls of victual, half
meal, half barley; themeal at 9 stone weight per boll, the
barley 4 silots per boll; L. 36: 15: 4 Sterling of money,
with a manse and globe.  The manse and office-houses were
all new built in 1769.  There are three churches in the pa-
rish.  One of them is built near the south end, between the
year 1000 and 1100.  It is now almost in ruins.  The other
two are in pretty good repair, particularly the one on the
shore near Mount Stuart House.  Worship is only performed
in it when any of the family are there.  The other kirk is
the ordinary place of worship, named the Mid-Kirk, being
more centrical for the inhabitants.
