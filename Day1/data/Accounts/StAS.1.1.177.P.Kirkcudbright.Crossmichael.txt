   The Prices of Provisions and Labour, and the Expences of a
Labourer's Family,-Differ so little here from those in the pa-
rish of Holywood, that the reader may be safely referred to
the account given in pages 26-27, and 28, of this volume.
It must, however, be observed, that the price of some articles,
though nominally the same in both places, is really lower
here; for the Kirkcudbright pound of cheese, butter, etc.
consisting of 28 ounces, is 4 ounces heavier than that of Dum-
fries.  Meal is for the most part 1 d. per stone cheaper here
than it is there.  A great part of the harvest work is per-
formed by persons from the moors, who hire for the whole
harvest, which includes reaping, putting in the crop, and
thatching the stacks.  Their wages are from L. 1: 1: 0 to
L. 1: 0: 0.  They sleep and are maintained in the farmers
houses, whether the weather permits them to work or not.

   Division, Rent, and Price of Land.-In the year 1771, a very
accurate map of this parish was drawn by Mr William M'Cart-
ney land surveyor; but, as this map was never engraven, on-
ly two copies are extant.  The number, size, and rents of the
estates are as under:
