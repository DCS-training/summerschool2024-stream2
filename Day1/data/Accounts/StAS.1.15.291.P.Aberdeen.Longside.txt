   Planting.-The want of woods and shelter in this corner of
Aberdeenshire, is one of the circumstances which seems to
operate most powerfully to its disadvantage, in the opinion
of our southern neighbours.  Such extensive tracts of count-
ry as those of Cruden, Longside, Peterhead, etc. without
either trees or hedges to diversify the landscape, are, to be
sure, not very gratifying to the eye.  And this sameness is the
more to be regretted, that the fields are far from conveying
the idea of barrenness, and that nature by no means intended
them to be thus naked and unprotected.  It is very evident
that Buchan was, some centuries ago, remarkably well wood-
ed.  Its extensive mosses contain the remains of very mag-
nificent trees.  No good reason, therefore, can be assigned
for the same sorts of wood not thriving in it again, is judicious-
ly managed.  But few attempts (comparatively speaking)
have been made to renew its woods; and those which have
been made, have in general been confined to the hilly and
most barren parts of the country; where the plants have not
only had no shelter, but little soil to bring them forward.  It
deserves attention, that in the mosses, where so many trunks
of large trees are every year dug up, none of the Scotch sirs
are ever found.  Yet this is the tree which has generally
been planted.  It commonly rises to a sufficient height to af-
ford shelter to other plants; and this seems to be all that
ought to be expected.  There are several instances in the pa-
rish, of the ash, the plane, the birch, laburnum, larch, spruce,
and even the oaks thriving well, if we make allowance for
the disadvantages under which they labour, with regard to
shelter.  The only plantation of any consequence in the pa-
rish, is one of about 250 acres; to which the above observa-
tions are very applicable.  When the interstices between the
Scotch sirs shall be filled up with other trees more suited to
