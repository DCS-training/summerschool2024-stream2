wool. Care in the selection of stock, and a more skilful method
of management, have been displayed. Among other things which
distinguish the present from the past, the pheasant is occasionally
seen in the woods that skirt the Stinchar. Numerous covies of
black game are also met with on the moor-edges, while grouse, the
favourite of the sportsman, is rapidly disappearing.
	The newly built farm-houses are of a much better description
than those of earlier date. They are almost all slated, and not
a few have an inclosure in front, ornamented with rose-bushes
and other shrubs and flowers. The farmer himself has shared in
the general improvement. The epithet "slovenly" is less ap-
plicable to him, and at "kirk and market" the outer man, at
least, shows a decided improvement. The voice of praise, indeed,
is not so often heard in their dwellings, and family-worship is
greatly neglected; but still the church is well attended, and the
people are moral and industrious. Intemperance appears to be
on the decline. The long and deep carousings, so common some
years ago, at buying and selling, are seldom heard of. A
greater decree of decency is observed at funerals, and the service
which, in some instances in olden times, amounted to fourteen
rounds of spirits and wine, has been reduced to three. Religious
animosities have ceased. On the whole, were it not for the heart-
burnings, and levelling spirit produced by the political discus-
sions of the day, the inhabitants of this parish would be contented
and happy.
