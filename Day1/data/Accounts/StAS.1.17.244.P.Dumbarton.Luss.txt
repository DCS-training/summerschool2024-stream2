Inchmoan, and kept together by the matted roots of coarse
graffes, gales, or Dutch myrtles, willows, etc.  In a small
lake in the Highlands of Perthshire, a Sloating isiand of this
kind actually exists*.

   Rivers.-There are 4 rivers in the parish, all of which dis-
charge themselves into Lochlomo d, but none of them are
remarkable for size: 1 st, The river Froon, which rises in
Glenfroon, and enters into the lake near the south end of
the parish.  2dly, The river of Finlass.  3dly, That of Luss.
And, 4thly, That of Dougloss, which forms a great part of
the boundary between the perishes of Lufs and Arrochar.

   Woods, etc.-There are 880 acres under natural wood.
Of these there are about 700 almost entirely under oak woods,
which have been usually cut down once in 20 years, and at
last cutting produced about 14000 bolls of bark+.  A cutting
of the whole oak woods of that age, at an average of prices
for 15 years past, may be valued at 76000 L.  They are of
such extent as to admit of their being properly divided into
20 separate hags or parts, one of which may be cut every
year.  The cutting commences about the beginning of May,
or as soon as the bark can be easily peeled, and must be over
before the middle of July.  Formerly there was little atten-
tion paid to the manner in which the work was performed
but now care is taken that the trees shall be all cut down
and peeled close to the ground, so as to make the young
shoots rise as much as possible directly from the earth, and
acquire roots of their own, independent of those of the pa-
rent stock.  For the same purpose, in rough and high
