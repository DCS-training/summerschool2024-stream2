   Population, etc.-The population has of late considerably
decreased, owing in some measure to the decline of the fishe-
ry, but chiefly to the practice of uniting several small farms 
into one.  On a farm of 1200 acres there are not now 7 or 8 
houses where 24 formerly were, and several emigrations have 
taken place from it.
