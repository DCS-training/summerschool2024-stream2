quarterly to lay it on.  The tenants are not mentioned in the
statute, but their attendance is desired, as they pay one half
of any sum that is imposed, and are best acquainted with the
state of the poor, in their own neighbourhood.  The busi-
ness is transacted without expence, excepting the fees of the
clerk, and of the collector.  The number of pensioners is be-

is, at present, in contemplation, to a aliment the poor with a
weekly allowance of meal, instead fo money, which may
more effectually ensure a subsistence, and prevent an improper
use of the public bounty.  Some saving may be made, also,
by purchasing the meal when it is cheap.  School-wages for
the children of thr poor, medical aid, and incidental expen-
ces, are paid by the collections at the church doors, and mort-
cloth money, which amount to about L. 15 a year.  It would
be an important object of inquiry, to ascertain, how far the levy-
ing of these assessments, or, poors-rates, has answered any
useful purpose, or whether the poor are comparatively in a
much worse situation, where they are not levied.
