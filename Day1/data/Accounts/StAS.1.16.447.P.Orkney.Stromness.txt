ness.  It has been suggested, that for the safety of the trade
passing by Stromness, it might be necessary to erect a fort
at the entrance of the harbour, since the the French priva-
teers, in time of war, have entered Hoy Sound, and have
been within two miles of the harbour.  But from the above
list it will appear, that the number of vessels passing this
way is not so great as has been supposed.  A frigate sta-
tioned here, it is probable, would be of more essential ser-
vice, both in defending the harbour, and in scouring the
coast.

   Shipping built at, and belonging to Stromness.-Several
small vessels, from 30 to 90 tons, have been built here.
There are at present (1794) 2 brigs and 4 sloops belonging
to the village of Stromness, in all about 500 tons.  Two
of these sloops are usually employed in the herring-fishing.
These vessels go abroad in quest of freights, as the trade
of this place cannot give them employment, as will be
seen from the following statement of exports and imports.

   Exports and Imports.-As there is no manufacture here
but that of stockings and linen yarn, nor any foreign trade,
the exports and imports will appear very inconsiderable,
when compared with places of greater trade.  In this com-
mercial age a detail of them may be required and read;
leaving it at the option of the editor to insert, and of the
reader to peruse it.  The articles of export and import are
subjoined in detail, upon the best information*.
