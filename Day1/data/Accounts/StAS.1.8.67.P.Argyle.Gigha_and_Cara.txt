minates the prospect; on the S. the Maoil of Kintyre and
the coast of Ireland, extending (past Bathlin) to the point of
Derry; on the W. the island of Ilay and the main ocean; and
on the N. the islands of Jura, Scarba, Dana, and the coast of
Knapdale, with the hills of Mull appearing behind.  The
pleasure arising from this view is greatly heightened, by the
number and variety of ships and small vessels, which constant-

in stormy, dark weather, when deprived of this enchanting
prospect, the loss is amply made up to the admirer of nature,
by observing the raging ocean discharge its fury against the
rock, whilst "list'ning with pleasing dread to its deep roar."

to oblige, and ready, by every exertion, to relieve the distress
of seafaring men.  They are, upon the whole, in a thriving
condition, content with their situation, and greatly attached

(which are as unfriendly to the industry and morals of a people,
as they are pernicious to their health), has been attended with

and more attentive to their business; though still they are not
so industrious as could be wished.  This, however, is owing
to causes, which it is not in their power wholly to remove.

   Disadvantages.-Division of labour, which is the highest
improvement in society, has not yet been carried such a

being industrious.  The farmer, accustomed to a certain mode
of labouring for the support of his family, never attempts
any greater exertion, while this object is accomplished.  There
is no market at hand, where ready money can be got for the
produce of the ground; and therefore no incitement to raise
