     NUMBER III.

     PARISH OF PORTPATRICK

   From Materials furnished by the Rev. Mr JOHN McKENZIE
     Minister of that Parish.

     Origin of the Name.

   PORPATRICK is called in the old charters Port Mont-
gomery, from a noble family of that name, who at one
time possessed large tracts of land on both sides of the Irish
Channel.  They were ennobled by the title of Earl Mount-
Alexander, which became extinct in 1758.  They have now
none of their Scots possessions remaining, but their represen-
tatives still inherit a considerable estate in Ireland.

   It is probable that Portpatrick was the antient popular
name of this place, and that the above family, when they be-
came the proprietors, had attempted to set it aside, and to
substitute their own.  This is one of the many monuments
which prove, that in antient times there flourished in Ireland
a very eminent person of the name of Patrick.  The vene-
ration for this name must have been very great, since, even
on this side of the water, it has prevailed over that of
Montgomery.
