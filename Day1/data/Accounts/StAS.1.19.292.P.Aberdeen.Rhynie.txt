meal, and L. 74 : 8 : 10 8/12.  The schoolmaster's salary is
7 1/2 bolls of meal, which is paid in small quantities by the
tenants.  The collections for the poor, including what is
made at the communion, amount to about L. 8 yearly,
which, with the interest of L. 15 of funded money, and
from L. 3 to L. 4 of feat-rents, has been found adequate to
their supply.

   Heritors, etc.-The whole parish is now the property of
the Duke of Gordon, who is patron of Rynie :  But Earl
Fife, as patron of Essie, has a vice patronage of the united
parishes.

   Antiquities.-On the top of Noth are, according to Mr
Williams, Dr Anderson, and others, the remains of a vi-
trified fort.  Some, however, are of opinion, that this is
only the mouth of an extinguished volcano.  The conical
shape of the hill favours the idea of a volcano; but the
stones and remains of a building are rather favourable to
the supposition of a vitrified fort.-There is a tradition of a
battle having been fought at a remote period about the
middle of this parish.  And a large stone, about five feet
diameter, on which there are some hieroglyphical charac-
ters, and standing on the moor of Rhynie, is said to have
been erected in memory of the engagement.  Part of this
stone has been lately broken:  But it is certainly very an-
cient.

   Eminent Men.-As this was the feat of a great many of
the Gordons during the feuds of the clans, this parish gave
birth to many brave fellows, eminent in days of turbulence,
but now consigned to oblivion.  Two anecdotes relative
to the history of those times are, however, worth preserving.
