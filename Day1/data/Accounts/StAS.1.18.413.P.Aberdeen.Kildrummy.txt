generations, this restraint must have been imposed from the
idea of inducing the people to bestow that labour on the soil,
which would be otherwise laid out on the calcination and
carriage of lime-stone.  In a country, where the whole cat-
tle are supported during the summer, on widely extended
mountain pasturage inaccessible to the plough, and where the
whole arable land is under crop at farthest by the middle of
June, there is an interval of nearly 3 months, in which the
whole operations of the field are necessarily suspended,
when the industry of the people coinciding with their own
inclination, might be more profitably exerted in making lime
for sale, than by their present casual and often misguided
exertions.  On the other hand, the liberty of following their
own judgement with regard to the use of lime on their farms,
would do more to promote the improvement of the soil, than
the present arbitrary restriction which evidently discourages,
rather than excites their industry.
   It is hardly of importance to mention, that there is a con-
siderable extent of natural birch-wood, on a bank overhang-
ing a brook winding near the castle; and small plantations
of forest and fir-trees at the manors of Clova and Brux.
   The horses, though of a small size, are of a fine figure,
spirited and hardy.  They appear to be an unmixed breed,
that has for ages past been raised in this quarter of the
country.  If properly broke, and well kept, they would
make fine pownies for ladies, and for an airing in the coun-
try.  They are sold from L. 4 or L. 5 to L. 12 or L. 14 ster.
Of late, their service has been required for the plough and cart.
In former times, when there were no carts in the country,
and when the plough was drawn by oxen, their labour was
restricted to the harrow,-to carrying out the dung in baskets
on their sides-bringing in the corn, and exporting the meal
and other commodities in panniers to the Aberdeen market.
