			III--POPULATION.

        The population according to the return made by Dr Webster was 	1443
        By the last Statistical Account,                                1800
               census of 1801,                                          1129
                         1811,                                          1215
                         1821,                                          1233
                         1831,                                          1300
                         1841,                                          1234

	   By the writer of the last Statistical Account of this parish, pub
	lisbed in 1793, the great increase of the population to that period
	from 1775, is ascribed to " a good deal of the waste land in the
	remoter parts of the parish having been lately brought into cul-
	ttre by families settling in these wilder parts." The subsequent
	much greater decrease from 1793 to 1801, amounting to more
	than a third part of the whole population, at the former of these
	periods, appears to have been owing to the extension of farms,
	and the consequent removal not only of many of the former te-
	nants and their families, but also of the cottagers and their fami-
	lies, who had been very numerous on some of the properties be-
	fore these changes were effected. Tlie apparent increase again
	from 1821 to 1831, may be accounted for from a number of ma-
	sons and labourers employed in building bridges, and in making
	the new line of road from Pitnisk to Dava, and other improvements
	that were then going on in the parish, who did not properly be-
	long to it; but were included in the census taken at the latter of
	these periods.

	   Character and Habits of the People.-The practice of illegal

	of the parish, was attended with all its usual pernicious effects on
	the inhabitants. Since their means of supports and of paying
	their rents from that source, have entirely ceased, a manifest im-
