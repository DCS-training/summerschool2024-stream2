and farmers, keep young horses for the harrow.  Because the
frost continues long in the spring, they sow, in general, later
than the people on the coast, and consequently reap later.
Wheat has been tried in Tulliebole, and in the southern part
of Fossaway; but the climate and soil are perhaps against it.
The surest crops are oats, barley, and pease.  The greatest part
of Tulliebole, and the low lying parts of the northern branch of
Fossaway, are of a sharp gravelly soil, and seldom fail in pro-
ducing good crops.  The southern branch of Fossaway, being
a mixture of loam and clay, will also bring forward beans,
and in good seasons wheat.  These are not, however, so sure a
crop as oats, barley, and pease.  Both parishes taken together,
not only serve themselves with grain, but send a considerable
quantity to market.  Lint is every where sown for family use,
and when properly managed makes a good return.  All
green crops, if the season is not very unfavourable, succeed
well.  Potatoes, turnips, clover, and rye-grass, when the
ground is properly prepared, seldom fail.  On the estate of
Fossaway, from which the parish derives its name, which
lies high, being situated partly on the Ochil hills, very con-
siderable improvements are at present carrying on, by the
proprietor, who possesses part of the lands himself.  Last sea-
son, there was raised a rich crop of turnips, to a large ex-
tent; and nearly 300 bolls of potatoes, which were exceed-
ingly fine.  This season (1795), not only grass, but almost
every other crop promises well; not only there, but in seve-
ral other parts of both parishes.

lands, either as proprietors, or tenants, are above 120; be-
sides a few tradesmen and cottagers, who possess as much
ground as will maintain one or two cows.  These small
portions of land, are here called pendicles, as depending
