closures is good. Many of the farm-houses are new, and as com-
modious as the mansion-houses of many Highland lairds. As far
as I am aware, every encouragement is given to improvement by
the proprietors.

                           V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	Markets- There are no weekly markets held in the parish ; but
there are three trysts or fairs held annually, which will be after-
wards mentioned. The distance from Gifford to Haddington,
where a market is held every Friday, is four miles. This town, it
is well known, affords to the surrounding country a good market for
all, kinds of agricultural produce. The Haddington corn-market
is the greatest in Scotland, owing probably in some measure to its
being entirely a ready money market.
	Means of Communication.-The road to Haddington, though
not very level, is kept, as all the other roads are, in good re-
pair. It might, however, be much improved at little expense by
cutting and raising. In this parish there are about three miles of
turnpike roads and thirteen of parish roads. The road from Gif-
ford to Edinburgh, which is distant about nineteen miles, is in a
good state of repair. Since the year 1750, when an act of Parlia-
ment empowered commissioners to repair the post-road from Dun-
glas Bridge to Ravenshaugh Bridge, the cross roads of this parish
and county have been greatly improved. Before that time the
roads were nearly impassable. At present, a one-horse coach tra-
vels three times a-week between Edinburgh and Gifford; leaving
Gifford on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays at 7 A. M., and
returning on the other days. It passes through Saltoun and Tra-
nent. It leaves No. 2, Princes Street, Edinburgh, at a quarter to
four afternoon, and performs the journey in about two hours and
a-half. There is a penny post-office in the village of Gifford. Till
