day, that will amount to upwards of 300,000 yards annually.
At 6 d per yard, which may be the average, that will amount
to L. 7500, as the total earning of that craft yearly.  By
this account, every weaver is supposed to earn about L. 21: 8 s
at an average.  And it is an undoubted fact, that an ordinary
tradesman can easily earn at least 15 a-day all the year round,
making allowance for ordinary avocations. It is said, that a
sober, industrious, and active hand, can even earn from 2 s to
4 s a-day, or at an average all the year round, is 6 d, mak-
ing reasonable allowances for avocations.
   N. B.  The fly shuttle is commonly used, and allowed to be
a great improvement.
   Allowing him to have 3 or 4 sons working with him,
though each son earn but half the wages of his father, the
amount is very considerable, and may enable a tradesman to
live well; and at the same time, provide liberally for his fa-
mily.  If he has daughters, their earnings at tambouring,
may be very nearly at an average, 4 d each day; though
it is said, when this branch was first introduced, they
could make from 1 s to 2 s a-day.  Even now, they sometimes
can earn a shilling.  Supposing the tambourers to be 280,
their joint earnings at 4 d daily, will amount to upwards of
L. 1200 sterling; or nearly L. 5 annually each.  But this is
doubtless a very low estimate.  I suppose at an average of old
and young, and making every allowance, they earn at least
L. 6 each*.

factory in this parish.  From very small beginnings, and some say with no
capital, he, in the course of 12 months, raised the business to a considerable
heighth, and employed many hands. At one time, he had 10 or 12 spinning
jennies employed. But either owing to great mismanagement or misfortune,
or perhaps to both, he instantly gave way; by which means, a few families in
