dug, as appears from their being of the same grain.  From
the entry, which has been upon the east, there was a strong
earthen wall, which was plowed down a few years ago; and
which run to the north, and separating the arable, from the
waste lands, joined the village of Libberton.  Upon the
south, there is to be seen the foundation of another strong
earthen wall; which likewise divides the arable, from the
waste lands; and, running through a steep descent, joins a
small burn, that runs through a glen.  There is no tradition,
concerning this camp, that can be depended upon.  Perhaps
it was erected by the Picts, during the time that they were in
a state of hostility with the Scots:  and this conjecture is sup-
ported by the following historical facts:  It is well known, that
the river Clyde was the divisive line, between the two con-
tending nations.  Now, as this camp is stationed on the very
verge of the western boundary, of the kingdom of the Picts,
there is every reason to believe, that it was erected by them.
It may be added, as a further proof of its being Pictish, that
there is to be seen, on the opposite side of the Clyde, at Dru-
malbang, about 4 miles distant, the vestige of a Scots lodge-
ment, or camp; to which they often resorted in their frequent
excursions from Dunbritton, (Dumbarton,) their principal
residence.  It is also well known, that, when in danger of an
attack from the Picts, they betook themselves to the strength
of the hill of Tinto, which stands in full view, and within 2
miles of this camp.  From all which, there is reason to be-
lieve, that this camp was erected by the Picts:  But whether
there has been any engagementat, or near it, history does
not mention.
   About 300 yards to the eastward of this camp, are three
small artificial hillocks, which have all the appearance of being
tumuli.
