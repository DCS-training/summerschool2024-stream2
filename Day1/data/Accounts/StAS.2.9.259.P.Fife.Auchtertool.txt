nished with a school-room also. The infant school is taught by
a female, and admits girls only between two and six years old. The
teacher receives from Miss Boswell of Balmuto L. 20 per annum,
together with a dwelling-house, small garden, and school-room.
The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accommodations, dwel-
ling house, school-room, and -garden.
   The rates of school fees are, per quarter, reading English, 2s.;
reading English and writing, 2s. 6d.; arithmetic and writing, 3s.
Latin, 5s. The cost of books, stationery, &c. is commonly nearly
equal to the fee.
   There are no young persons in the parish betwixt six and fifteen
years of age who cannot read; and none upwards of fifteen years of
age who can neither read nor write. The people in general duly
appreciate the benefits af education, and parents in particular feel
deep interest in the education of their children. This appears in
the average amount of children attending the three schools in the
parish, 150.
   Literature.--There is a parish library in the village of Auch-
tertool, established in March 1824. It was established and books
purchased, with contributions from the families of Donibristle and
Balmuto, and from the minister of the parish. The library, and
all its concerns, are under the direction of such of these original
contributors as choose to attend to it, whether one or more. The
library is now furnished with 215 volumes, consisting of history,
travels, voyages, and books on moral and religious subjects.
   Savings-Bank.-- A savings-bank was established in the year 1827.
The following is a tabular view of the sums invested yearly, com-
pared with the sums annually withdrawn, the last seven years.

   It is to be regretted that the greater part of the above deposits
belnngs not to that class, for whose benefit saving banks have been
established, viz. house-servants, day labourers and others who have
not means to enable them to deposit such sums as ordinary banks
will receive; but who may deposit in the savings bank small sums
down to Is. which may well be spared from ample wages well paid.
