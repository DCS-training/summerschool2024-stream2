veyor, landwaiter, 4 tidemen, and 4 boatmen.  Within the
district there are 3 creeks, viz.  Catcraig on Fleet, Balcarry
Bay, and Pow at Barlochan Mill, upon the river Urr.  The
district extends from the east side of the river Urr, where it
joins the district of the custom-house of Dumfries, to the
burn of Carsloath, where it connects with Wigton custom-
house, being about 50 miles in length.

   Schools.-Within the burgh there are, 1 rector of the gram-
mar school, 1 teacher of writing and arithmetic, and 1 teacher
of English.  The rector enjoys a salary of 30 L. per annum,
the other two have 30 L. between them.  The scholars are
numerous, and well taught.  Both the rector of the grammar
school, and the writing master, keep boarders, at the rate of
16 L. per annum.

   Church, etc.-The present minister was ordained the 27th
of September 1770, is married, and has 13 children, viz.
7 sons and 6 daughters.  As to his stipend, he cannot well
say what it is.  About 20 years ago he raised a summons of
augmentation, with the concurrence and approbation of all his
heritors; but from the violent contests which afterwards arose
amongst them, about their adjusting their tiends, the locality
is not yet finished.  The unavoidable expence, in which these
litigations have involved the minister, is not less than 250 L.
Whether the heritors will lay this to heart, and reimburse
him, according to their promise at the commencement of the
process, he cannot say.  When the locality is fixed, the whole
stipend, in money and victual, will not exceed 112 L.-a poor
sum for so rich and extensive a parish, and a populous royal
burgh.-Though there are 3 glebes in the parish, yet the mi-
nister possesses only one, and it is the worst of the three.  It
is the worst in quality, and scarce the legal half in quantity.
