     Statistical Account

which extend from thence to the west coast of Scotland,
There is a davoch of land belonging to this parish in the
valley of Strathconnon, in the bosom of the western moun-
tains, at the distance of 10 computed, or 18 English miles.
It is surrounded by the parish of Contin, and forms a part of
the mission in that parish.

   Surface, Soil, and Climate.-The general face of the parish
presents a picturesque view of corn-fields, intermixed with
barren muir, clumps of natural wood*, rapid streams, large
plantations around gentlemen's seats, with different views of
the two beautiful Friths of Dingwall and Beauly, which,
as canals formed by the hand of nature, and penetrating
for upwards of 20 miles into a populous country, invite
the merchant and manufacturer to settle on their banks.-
The soil is as various as the general face of the ground;
but, on the whole, is warm, dry, and productive.  The
fields on the slopes of the tiring grounds are compara-
tively of a richer soil than the low ground, except a part of
the estate of Lovat, which once belonged to the priory of
Beauly, and is a deep, rich, carse ground.  The plains abound
with pebbles, from 4 to 6 or 8 pound weight, evidently
rounded by friction, and intermixed with beds of dry sand
and gravel.  Hence a considerable part of the low ground is
barren dry muir, producing only a short heath; and the arable
land (with a few exceptions) of inferior quality to that on the
high lands.  On one estate there are several small hollows

*Every little burn and meadow presents a bush of natural
wood, consisting mostly of alter, interspersed with ash.  There
are a few bushes of birch, some oaks and willows.  Around
gentlemen's seats there are to be seen large plantations of firs,
and other forest trees.  They continue to plant every year, par-
ticularly Mr Mackenzie of Seaforth, who rears an extensive nur-
sery for that purpose.
