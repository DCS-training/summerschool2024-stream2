ciently convinced of the advantage of inclosing, which they
show, by giving higher rents for inclosed than uninclosed
grounds.  The whole of the lands of Abercrombie are di-
vided into farms, containing from 40 to 60, 80, and 117
acres, and but a trisle in small parcels.  The rent
varies, some being 15 s. L. 1, L. 1, 10 s. L, 1, 15 s. and
some up to L. 2 the acre.  The whole acres are 600, and
upwards.  The valued rent is L. 1486 Scots, but the real
rent I cannot determine.  The whole number of acres,
therefore, in the parish is about 866, and the valued rent
L. 2693: 13: 4 Scots.  There is a mill in the lands of
Abercrombie, to which all the tenants are thirled, for such
grains as are mealed for the use of their families, and pay
malture.

   Agriculture, etc.-About 15 years ago, the only plough
used here was the old Scots plough, of a very heavy and
clumsy construction.  It was drawn sometimes by 2 oxen,
and 2 horses; and sometimes by 4 oxen 1 horse.  But
what is now generally used is the small English plough
with iron mould-bond, and the Scots plough, of a shorter
and lighter construction than formerly; and a plough, com-
posed of partly English and partly Scots, having an iron
mould-board and head.  The English plough makes the
neatest work, but does not answer in stony ground; where-
as the Scots answer all grounds.  All these ploughs are
now commonly drawn by 2 strong horses; except when
breaking up stiff land from grass that has been down for
some years, than 3 or 4 horses are used.  One man both
holds the plough, and manages the horses by a pair of long
reins, except when more than 2 horses are used.  The rol-
ler is frequently used here, as the ground is fridle, in the
spring upon the wheat crop, to shut up the surface, and
thereby to prevent the fatal effect of the frost at that season;
