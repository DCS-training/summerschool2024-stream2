   Character of the People.-The inhabitants, in general,
are not inferior to those of any country in hospitality and
charity.  Many exert themselves, in private, to relieve their
neighbours, when they are in need of aid; and in pub-

bution has been cheerful and liberal.  However, though
hospitable, they are jealous of strangers residing among

inhabitants are Protestants.  There are no sectaries, ex-
cept a few, who call themselves Covenanters, whose cha-
rity is not very extensive.  Charity with them is con-
fined to the household of faith; the members of which
they are at no loss to distinguish, and evidently find them
to be few.
