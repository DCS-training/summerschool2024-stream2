   Prices of Provisions and Labour.- The price of oat-meal is
about 1 s. 6 d. or 1 s. 10 d. a stone.  The scarcity occation-
ed by the bad and late harvest of 1782 was less severely felt
in Stranraer than in most places.  The late Earl of Stair, and
some of the more wealthy inhabitants, procured meal early
in the season, at a reasonable price, and sold it at 2 s. a
stone;  70 or 80 poor families in the town were indeed sup-
plied at 1 s. 8 d. a stone.  The price of good beef, last
Martinmas, was 2 1/2 d. and 2 3/4 a pound, of 16 ounces, when
taken in whole carcases, or by the quarter; mutton the fame;
they are now 3 d. and 31 d; veal 4 d; lamb, when plenty,
2 1/2 d. and 3 d.; salmon, from Glenluce and Ballantrae, 2 d.
a pound; butter 8 d. a pound, of 24 ounces; eggs 2 d a
dozen; fowls 8d.; geese, at Martinmas, 1s. 2 d. a piece;
a turkey 2 s. 6 d. or 3 s.; rabbits 5 d. a pair without the skins;
water sowls at reasonable prices; sea fith, sold by the hand,
is extremely cheap.  Little cheese is made in this country,
and is of the poorest kind; it fells at 4s. the stone, of 26
pounds.  A labourer's wages are 1 s. a day for nine months,
and 9 d. or 10 d the rest of the year; a mason's 1 s. 6 d. or
1 s. 8 d; a house carpenter the same; a taylor 6 d. with, or
1 s. without victuals.

   Roads.-The great road from Carlifle to Portpatrick goes
through the town.  This road was made, and is kept in re-
pair, by government.  Government has also givern a sum of
money to finish some cross roads, which, when finished, will
render this county as easy of access, both from England and
from Airshure, as any county in the island.  The mail coach
from London passes through the town every day; a diligence
from Air to Portpatrick palle thrice a week.  The other
roads in the district are made, and kept in repair, by the con-
