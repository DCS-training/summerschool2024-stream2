land are let at 2 guineas per acre.  The farmer depends, for
the payment of his rent, chiefly upon the sale of his bullocks
and heifers; which are annually rent to the English market,
about 3 years old, and fetch excellent prices.  But should the
demand for Galloway cattle and sheep at any time cease, in the
southern parts of the united kingdom, or should the prices
fall, for a few years successively, the farmer must infallibly
become bankrupt; for he has little or no dependence upon the
sale of his grain, which, for the most part, turns out to no great
account.  From the thinness of the population, a considerable
quantity of the grain produced cannot be consumed in this
country.  Hence it must be sent coast-ways, to the English
market, or to Greenock and the west; of Scotland.  But as
this is attended with considerable expence, and besides depends
upon a variable market, it does not always make that profit-
able return, which the farmer thinks he had a right to expect.
It is for this reason, that proprietors, when granting leases of
their farms, generally estimate the value of the rent, from the
number of sheep and cattle which the farm will feed, and not
from the quantity of grain which it will produce.-Accord-
ing to the ancient valuation roll, the free rent of the parish
was 6029 L. 8 s. L d. Scotch.  Its present rent is more than
6,000 L. Sterling.  There are very few proprietors in this ex-
tensive parish.  The EARL of SELKIRK posseses above five
sixths of the whole property.

   Forest Trees.-Besides those various useful improvements
in husbandry, which are carried on in the parish, these which
are also adapted for ornament, as well as utility, ought not
to be omitted.  The Earl of Selkirk has planted, with great
taste and judgment, several hundred acres, with various kinds
of forest trees, such as oaks, beeches, ashes, elms, birches, ches-
nuts, sycamores, hornbeams, rowans, walnuts, larches, together
