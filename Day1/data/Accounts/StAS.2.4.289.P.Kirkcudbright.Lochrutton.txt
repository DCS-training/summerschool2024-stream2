			V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	Market-Town.--Dumfries is the nearest market and post town,
It lies about four miles eastward. There the farmers sell their
grain, cattle, and horses. A great proportion of the cattle are
bought to be sent to England. The parish not only supplies itself
with provisions, but a considerable quantity of oats and barley to be
disposed of in the Dumfries market, and generally bought to be
exported to England, chiefly Liverpool. The pork fed in the
parish, which is considerable, is sold also in Dumfries, and sent
to Newcastle chiefly.
	Ecclesiastical State.--The church was built in 1819, and is in
a very good state of repair. It affords accommodation for upwards
of 300 sitters. It is sufficient for the present population of the
parish. There are no free sittings in it. It is distant only a little
more than a mile from the eastern and northern extremities of
the parish; but more than three from the southern and western.
The number of families belonging to the Established Church is 109.
The average yearly amount of the collections for the last five years
for charitable and religious purposes, L.2, 9s.
	There are 14 Cameronians, 17 Seceders, 9 Roman Catholics,
and 3 Independents in the parish.
	The manse is partly old and partly new. The old part was
built in 1777, the new in 1809. Both parts were repaired lately.
The glebe is about ten acres in extent, very much broken with
knolls, and may be worth L. 10 yearly. The teind is exhausted,
and the stipend, valued in money, amounts to L. 182, 6s 4d.
	Mr Thomas Inglis, the present incumbent, was admitted from
the parish of Dunscore to Lochrutton in 1807. His predecessors
in Lochrutton, as far as they can be traced, were, Alexander
Train, member of the General Assembly at Glasgow in 1638;
