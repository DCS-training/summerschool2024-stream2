     The Statistical Account.

   Sketch second contains a plan of the cistern, and exhibits
the manner in which the water is filled into the buckets.
   The diameter of the wheel to the extremities of the float-
boards is 28 feet; the length of the float-boards, 10 feet. The
wheel makes nearly four revolutions per minute; in which
time it discharges into the cistern 40 hogsheads of water.
But this is not all the wheel is capable of performing; for
by several accurate trials by Messrs Whitworth and Meikle,
in the result of which, though made separately, they perfect-
ly agreed, it was found that the wheel was able to lift no less
than 60 hogsheads per minute; but that the diameter of the
pipes through which the water descends from the cistern
would not admit a greater quantity than what they already
receive.
   To a person at all conversant in hydraulics, the resem-
blance of this to the Persian wheel must be obvious; and
indeed it is probable, that from the Persian wheel the first
idea of this machine was derived.  But admitting this, still
the superiority of the present wheel is, in most respects, so
conspicuous, as to entitle it to little less praise than the first
invention.  For, 1st, In the Persian wheel, the buckets be-
ing all moveable, must be constantly going out of order: In
this wheel they are all immoveable, consequently never can
be out of order.  2dly, Instead of lifting the water from the
bottom of the fall as in the Persian wheel, this wheel lifts it
from the top of the fall, being from four to five fect higher;
by which means some additional power is gained.  3dly, By
means of the three sluices, (a and b, b, fig. 1.) in whatever si-
tuation the river may be, the quantity of the water to be raised
is so nicely adjusted to that of the moving power, as constant-
ly to preserve the wheel in a steady and equable motion.  In
short, as a regulator is to a watch, so are these sluices to this
wheel, whose movements would otherwise be so various, as
