in the year 1742, with a salary of L. 7 Sterling per annum,
which continued a short time, when the then schoolmaster re-
signed his office.  Upon this event, application was made
to the Society for the school being continued, and a young
man was sent from this country, to be examined for that
end.  Although he did not give that full satisfaction ex-
pected, yet he was not rejected, but was remitted for fur-
ther improvement.  This has been since laid before the
Society, accompanied with a Presbyterial representation, but
no appointment has taken place, (1795), though the young
man officiated as teacher for some time after his return, in the
hope of being preferred.-The minister, on account of his
having more than one place of worship, cannot preach above
once a month in Sandness, even although his tours should
be regularly performed; but, through the inclemency of
the weather in winter, and other unavoidable causes, he
cannot be there above eight or nine times in the year.  To
supply this deficiency, and to engage the inhabitants in a
suitable manner on the Lord's day, the charity-schoolmas-
ter was wont to convene them in the church, read a sermon-
book, and catechise them, as they were at the distance of
six miles from the church of Walls.  Should the Society
be graciously disposed to grant a re-establishment, it would
greatly contribute to the interest of religion, and good mo-
rals; as the people are too poor to have schools of their own
erected, and are now paying their proportion to the legal
schoolmaster in Walls.  Now (1797) are two charity-schools
in Sandness and Papa, with a salary of L. 10 Sterling per
annum from the Society, proportioned between the two
schoolmasters.
