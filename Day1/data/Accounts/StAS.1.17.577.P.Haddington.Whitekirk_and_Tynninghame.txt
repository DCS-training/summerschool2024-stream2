inclosed and divided his fields with stripes of planting of 40,
50, and 60 feet broad.  The East Links, which are situated
close upon the sea-beach, were at that time a dead and barren
sand, with scarcely any grass upon them, and of no use but
as a rabbit-warren.  A gentleman from Hamburgh, happen-
ing to be at Tynninghame, mentioned to Lady Haddington
that he had often seen trees growing on such a soil; this hint
was taken, and the links planted; at that time, all who saw
them thought the expence of trees and labour thrown away;
but, contrary to their expectations, they throve as well as on
the best grounds.  The trees planted in the links are the
Scotch fir; in Binning wood there is a great variety, viz. oak,
ash, beech, elm, plain, sir, willows, anti several others; the
thinnings of which have, for many years past, yielded a con-
siderable income, often above 500 L. a-year; and, besides the
advantage that is derived from the shelter which the plan-
tations afford, the grass in the woods is much more valuable
than it would have been, if allowed to remain in its original
state.  Binning wood consists of about 300 acres; the plan-
tations upon the estate have, at different times, been extend-
ed, and there are now above 800 acres of ground planted at
Tynninghame.  In the united parishes, altogether, there will
be above a thousand.

   Population.-As the schoolmaster's house was unfortunately
burnt in the 1760, the session registers of the parish of White-
kirk were destroyed at the same time, which renders it im-
possible to give any account of the births and marriages in
this parish prior to that period.  In the parish of Tynning-
hame, which at that time was not united to Whitekirk, the
average of births for 10 years following 1700 was 23 1/2, and
of marriages 6, the average for: 10 years following 1750 was
of births 17 1/5, of marriages 3.
