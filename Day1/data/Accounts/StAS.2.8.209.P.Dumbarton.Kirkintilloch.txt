wards form about halfthe population,which in this parish will be 3078,
--those under twelve, and of course not reaching that age, will be
about 2500; of these 472 are attending school, which, is about a-
third of the number, or one-thirteenth of the whole population.
   There are two libraries, namely, a parish library and a subscrip-
tion library.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.--The Gartshore mortification in fa-
vour of orphan children was originally about L. ll00.  Each or-
phan is allowed a firlot of oatmeal at a time, or one boll annually.
The sum received by each is in no case to be less than L. 1,or
more than L. 5 per annum. Some get Is. 8d. per week in money.
The oatmeal in December 1836 was 5s. l0d. per firlot; in July
1837, it was 5s. 21/2.; in December of the same year, 4s., and in
June 1838, it was 4s. 4d. per firlot. There were lately 23 or-
phans on the charity, 12 of whom were boys. The following was the
state of accounts in 1836 and 1837: Receipts 1836, received
from Miss Galloway, L. 9, 13s. 4d.; lifted from Ship Bank,
L. 10; lifted all the money from Ship Bank, L. 20; interest on
above sums, L. 3, 13s. 4d.; total L. 43, 6s. 8d. Receipts for
1837, received from Mr Gordon, factor at Gartshore, L. 35.
   Some time ago, L. l000 Sterling was left by John Adam, Esq.
London, the interest of which is to be devoted exclusively to the sup-
port of the poorest of the poor, or part may go for the education ofthe
same class. The trustees are the heritors and kirk-session. The
sum has not yet been realized, but the principal, with interest when
it arrives, will amount to a considerable capital. In 1837, there
was collected for coals at the parish church, L. 9, 16s.; at St
David's, L. 5, Os. 6d.; from Mr Calder, 10s.; total, L. 15, 6a. 6d.
Paid at Glen Collieries, L. 12, 16s.; Cowgate toll, 13 carts, 2s.
6d.; tolls lls.; horse, 16s.; total, L. 14, 5s. 6d.
   An assessment for the poor was only imposed in 1831. It
amounts to twopence per pound:
