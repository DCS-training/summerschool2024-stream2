     of Gargunnock.

   The house of Gargunnock has acquired an additional gran-
deur, from the fine front built by Col. Eidingtoun in summer
last.
   There is one general remark to be made, respecting the
dryfields.  No portion of them is now allowed to lie ne-
glected.  They are almost entirely inclosed throughout their
whole extent, to the bottom of the mountain; and the heri-
tors vie with each other, in decorating and fertilizing this
part of their property.

   Carse.-Etymologists explain this word, as signifying rich
or fertile.  This account is justified by fact, for such lands,
when properly cultivated, produce luxuriant crops.  About
forty years ago, the carse grounds lay almost in a state of
nature, unprofitable to the landlord, for it was difficult to
find men who would venture to possess them.  Bad roads,
fields uninclosed, the stiffness of the soil, ignorance of that kind
of farming which is suited to the carse, presented great diffi-
culties when any attempt was made towards improvement.
But now it is astonishing to observe the effects of better hus-
bandry.  The rivulets flowing from the hills, through the
carse, have been confined within their proper channel, so as
to prevent the overflowing of the fields, excepting upon very
rare occasions, after excessive rains; many of the farms are
fenced with hedges, in a thriving condition; the old division
of the lands into outfield, and infield has been abolished.
The practice of liming is followed, with great success; a re-
gular rotation of crops has been almost universally adopted;
and from 4 shillings sterling per acre, there has been of late
a rise to upwards of a guinea, and in some instances, to 30
shillings sterling.
   The whole carse it is believed, was originally under water.
