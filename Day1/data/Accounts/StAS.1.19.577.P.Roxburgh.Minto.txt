or, alongst with the collections, is distributed by the session
in interim supplies, in case of sickness, or any other unfore-
seen calamity.  In 1782, when oatmeal rose very high,
the curators of the poor bought in a quantity, and fold it at
a reduced price, both to the poor on list and poor house-
holders with large families.  There are no begging poor
in the parish.  The poor-rates are more than double within
these ten years, notwithstanding the liberality of the fa-
mily of Minto, who, when on the spot, gave a good deal
of private charity, and a weekly proportion of broth and
meat, which is continued in their absence.

   Manse.-The manse was removed to its present situation
in 1773, and is in good repair.  The glebe consists of 35
English acres.  The stipend upwards of L. 90.

   School.-The established schoolmaster is the only teacher
within the parish.  He has a house, garden, and school-
house; salary L. 12, including the emoluments of session-
clerk, collecting the poor-rates, &c.  The number of scho-
lars, at an average, between 50 and 60.  In March 1792,
above 50 scholars were seized with the measles in two days,
so rapid was the infection.  The schoolhouse was then
small and confined, which moved the heritors to build one
in an airy situation, the most beautiful and commodious in
the south of Scotland.

   Fuel.-The distance from fuel, and other local disadvan-
tages, have hitherto discouraged manufactures, &c, notwith-
standing there are a number of mechanics.  Weavers, 7;
blacksmiths, 3; tailors, 3; one nailor, who employs 5
hands; three carpenters, who employ 10 hands; one corn
and one lint mill.  Coals in general are burnt, (which are
carried at the distance of 30 miles), and peats and wood.
