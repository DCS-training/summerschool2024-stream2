or 40 yards.  It never freezes even in the hardest winters
nor does the rivulet into which it runs freeze for a consider-
able distance after their junction.  The rivulets afford burn
trouts in the spring and summer months; and plenty of sea
trouts, of no considerable value, are caught in them, from
Michaelmas till after Martinmas*.

   Population.-Previous to the survey taken by Dr Webster,
the population of this parish cannot be ascertained; but, from
a pretty accurate survey taken in spring 1791, the numbers
and professions of the inhabitants were found to be as stated
in the following statistical table.

<FOOTNOTE>

*From the dry land quite through Lochar Moss, there is a
fine spot of meadow ground, made in the course of ages by the
rivulet, which was the ancient boundary, in this district, be-
tween Nithsdale and Annandale, and by those rivulets which
run by the Cleughbrae-mill, and by the village of Mousewald,
and which meet at the side of the glebe, a little below the
manse, and thence got the name of the Minister's Burn.  Of
this meadow ground, 102 acres, lying in this parish, and be-
longing to the Duke of Queensberry, were divided among his
tenants about 40 years ago, and inclosed by ditches.  A consi-
derable part at it is still laid under water by the Michaelmas
floods, whereby it is enriched, but seldom suffers any damage
by the floods which happen about Lammas, as the meadows on
the fide of Lochar often do.
