	Alehouses.--There are 9 ale or public-houses in the parish,
the effect of which upon the morals of the people is most perni-
cious. Various attempts have been made, from time to time, both
to lessen their number, and to restrain their licentiousness; but
the misnamed liberality of the present age opposes all such at-
tempts, as encreachments on the liberty of the subject.
	        	MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATION.
	There are two things which have frequently been mentioned
as being rather opposed to the improvement of tbe place: the
largeness of the farms, most of them being of greater extent than
one man can easily superintend; and the want of resident heri-
tores, or men of wealth and influence, who might either propose or
carry into effect any plan for the public good.
	It also been often mentioned, that a road round the island
would be of vast consequence to the parish; both to tho farmer
in carrying his produce to market, and in collecting his manure
for the fields; to the inhabitants in general in their ordinary in-
tercourse, and to strangers, who visit in the summer months, who
might be thereby induced to build villas round the shore, and
consequently to remain in the place, and thereby increase the
value of the respective properties, and add to the means and re-
sources of the parish in general.
