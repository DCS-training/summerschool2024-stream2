   Diseases.-While the climate is so noxious to plants, it
cannot be favourable to the bodies of animals:  most of the
diseases, which take their rise from a cold damp air, prevail
here, such as rheums and pulmonary complaints;  but the
scurvy is the most predominant disease;  and is attended
with violent symptoms, such as aching pains the joints

and intermitting fevers are little known;  the putrid fever
has appeared but once these last 20 years.  Formerly the
small-pox never appeared in the parish, without proving fatal

have been taugh to change their way of managing children
in that disease;  and some are so hardy as to inoculate their
children with their own hand so that very few die of that
distemper.

   Rivers and Lakes.-The rivers of Ruthven, and Allan,
both take their rise in the neighbourhood of Gleneagles.
St Mungo's well is the source of the first, which passing the
house of Gleneagles, takes it course eastward, and falls into
the Earn, to the north east of Auchterarder.  The latter
runs west through Strathallan, passes Dumblane, and falls
into the Forth, about a smile above Stirling bridge.  Both
these rivers abound with the common red trout.  The Allan,
which is sed by a number of rivulets from the neighbouring
Ochils, is sometimes so swelled, as to lay a great part of the
