   In a very small island in Lochard, are still to be seen the
ruins of a castle, reported by universal tradition to have been
built by the the Duke of Albany, uncle to James I. of Scot-
land.  He is said to have intended it for a retreat, almost
inaccessible by its situation, when he was under apprehen-
sions of being prosecuted on account of his ambitious designs.
