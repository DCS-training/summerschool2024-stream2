     of Kirkaldy.

in the days of superstition appears to have been the tutelar
saint of the place*, and who has entailed his name on a
small division of the burgh lands, which is called in the regis-
ter of sasines St. Brisse or St. Bryce's Deal.  The church is
but in indifferent repair; nor could it well be otherwise, when
neither the heritors nor town-council have for more than 180
years taken any charge of it.  What repair it has received
during that time have been paid for by the kirk-session.  On the
recommendation of the heritors and council, the collections
made at the church doors before the afternoon service were
for a while employed for this purpose.  But the presbyte-
ry having inhibited that application of the collections, the
church has for more than a century been kept in repair out of
a part of the seat-rents, which are under the management of
the kirk session.

   Seats.-Originally the whole area of the church was in
their hands: And their records shew that all the incorpora-
tions, and such of the heritors as have seats, (more than the
half of them have none) derived their rights from the kirk-
session.  They still retain about a fourth part of the church;
from which they draw annually from L. 18 to L. 20.
The necessary repairs are desrayed from this fund, the
remainder of which goes to the maintenance of the poor
in common with the collections.  Some of the heritors of
Abbotshall retain their seats in the church of Kirkaldy; and
by a decreet of the Court of Session in 1685, are found liable

*The arms of the burgh appear to have been framed in compliment to
this saint.  These are a Gate of a Church, with the Saint standing in it,
having a Mitre on his head, something esembling a Cross in his hand, a
Moon and Star, as emblems of night round him; and the motto under,
Vigilandon munio.
