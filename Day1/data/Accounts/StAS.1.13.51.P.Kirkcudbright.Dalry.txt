Though we are strongly disposed to recommend to farmers
here the use of lime, and are convinced, that if they have
a long leafe they must be gainers by it, yet we must can-
didly own, considering the expense of it at this distance,
that farmers who are near the places where plenty of it
may be obtained, partly from the certainty of not being
disappointed as to the quantity which they want, and partly
from the carriage being easily accomplished at very little
expense, may be greater gainers by the use of lime, through
they pay for their lands the acre double the rent which is
paid by the farmers here; may, perhaps the former, with
the advantages they possess, could pay a higher rent for
their lands, and yet be greater gainers than the latter,
though they had their lands rent-free.  Hence it is evi-
dent, that the proprietors of lands here ought not to exact
for them such a high rent as is paid for those which are
more advantageously situated, and that if they wished to
have a great rent for their lands, they should, in the first
place, encourage their tenants to render them really valu-
able, by enriching them with lasting manure.  If a tenant
undertakers to lime any considerable extent of land, the 
proprietor surely ought, on this account, either to give him
his farm at a lower rent, and for a longer period than
otherwise he would have done, or to allow him a proper
recompence for every real improvement.  But let no pu-
blic spirited farmer here, who has a lease of such length as
to indemnify him, conclude from what has been said, that
he ought not to lime his lands, because his profit by the
operation cannot be near so great as that of the farmer,
who is ast far less distance from lime or other lasting manure,
or because his landlord is not disposed to give him the full
recompence of his expenses.  Though he has little propit
at all, let him do something for the benefit of his country,
and of posterity.  Whoever makes a single acre of land
