   Value rent of the three parishes, 3384 L. 16 s. 8 d. Scots
money.

   Poor, etc.-The poors funds here, are the interest of 160 L.
mortified money, which is lent out at 5 per cent., the weekly
collections, and an annual donation from Invercauld, of from
10 L. to 12 L. Sterling.  From which 93 poor receive aid.  A
Mrs. Elizabeth Farquharson, late of Jamaica, and a native of
the parish of Tulloch, bequeathed at her death, which hap-
pened between 20 and 30 years since, 400 L. Sterling for the
benefit of the poor here, and the like sum to keep school
and schoolmaster in these parishes. There were 4 trustees ap-
pointed to execute this part of her will; but somehow or
it was neglected for upwards of 20 years, when at last
one of the trustees who had friends in Jamaica, recovered the
400 L. of principal, and 200 L. of interest; and the 600 L. have
now been in the bank at Aberdeen for several years; but the
parishes have as yet received no benefit from them.  It sure-
ly could not have been the intention of the testator, that the
money should be so long in being applied to the purposes it
was designed for.
