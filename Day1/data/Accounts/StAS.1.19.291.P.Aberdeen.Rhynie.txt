   The parish of Rynie lies in the south-west extremity of
this lordship, and of the strath of Strathbogie.  The soil
of the parish is various; loamy near the river Bogie;
stonny and gravelly, yet very fertile, near the bottom of
the hills; and in some low ground a clay, in others a mof-
fy soil.  Agriculture has not yet made great advances,
there being only about ten acres of turnip, and 40 acres of
sown grass, in the whole of this extensive parish.  Yet the
farmers are beginning to improve their lands; and to en-
able them to do so, there is abundance of limestone in some
of the neighbouring parishes.

   Mountain.-Though there are several hills, there is only
one of these which deserves the name of a mountain.  It
is called the hill of North; and is of a conical shape, spring-
ing from its base about 600 feet, and at least 1000 feet above
the level of the sea.  The whole parish is elevated above
that level at least 400 feet.  As a proof of this elevation,
the river Gady rises near the borders of this parish, and
after falling into the Ury, and along with it into the Don,
runs into the sea at Aberdeen, after a course of 30 miles
to the south-east; and the river Bogie, which runs through
the parish, after mixing its waters with the Deverson, and
running also nearly 30 miles in a north-west direction, falls
into the Moray Frith at Banff.

   Population, Rent, etc.-The number of persons in this
parish is 631; but, according to Dr Webster's list in 1755,
it amounted to 836.  The number of horses, 172; of black-
cattle, 882; and of sheep, 2255.-The rent of the parish
is about L. 700.  The ministers stipend is two chalders of
