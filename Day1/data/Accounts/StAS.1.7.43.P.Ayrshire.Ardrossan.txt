     of Ardrossan.

twixt the Castle of Ardrossan and the limits of the parish,
on the east, is a beautiful inclined plain, mostly of very good
ground.  Towards the west, the hills are nearer the sea.
About two miles from the coast, a ridge of small hills bound
the prospect.  The tops of some of them are planted with
large clumps of forest trees, which have a very pleasing ef-
fect.  Beyond these the surface is irregular; in some places
coarse and marshy; in others dry, fruitful, and pleasant.
The soil is various.  Betwixt the point of Ardrossan and
town of Saltcoats, grass and clover grow spontaneously with-
in a very little of flood-mark.  The sand is soon succeeded
by a thin layer of earth, on a pebbley bottom.  A little far-
ther from the shore, it is mostly a loamy earth, with a mix-
ture of sand.  On the north-east and north sides of the pa-
rish, the soil is, in general, a strong deep clay, capable of
bearing great crops when well drained and manured, but apt
to produce only sent and other coarse grass where it is ne-
glected.

   Agriculture.-Though the soil of this parish be, in general,
capable of very high improvement; yet, in many places, the
state of agriculture, compared with that of other parishes in
the same country, is much behind.  Its present state, how-
ever, compared with that in the remembrance of some old
men, shows that the farmers have not been altogether idle or
ignorant.  Forty, even thirty years ago, the land was almost
in a state of nature, very low rented, and the parish almost
destitute of inclosures.  At that time farmers had very few
inducements to ingenuity and activity.  Towns and villages
in the neighbourhood were very small, compared to what
they are at present; consequently, the consumpt of the pro-
duce much less, and the price of vivres not above the half, in
many instances not above the third of what they now bring.
