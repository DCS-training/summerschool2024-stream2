houses being allowed to fall into ruins; and the reason of this
was, that the tenants in the place, at the last let of the lands,
had such a small pittance allowed to each, that they could
not afford their cottagers any longer the ground necessary

   Heritors and Rent.-There are many heritors in this parish;
the most considerable are, Count Lockhart of Lee and Carn-
wath, Lord Braxfield, William Bertram of Nilbet, Sir James
Stewart Denholm of Coltness and Wichfield, John and Wil-
liam Wilsons of Wilsontown, William Tenant of Pool, Mrs
Lockhart of Eastfield, Mr Logan of Woodend, and upwards
of 30 more.  These last, two or three excepted, reside on their
own property, consisting of farms from 80 L. down to 10 L.
of annual rent, which they, in general, occupy themselves.

is William Bertram, Esq; at Kerswell, about two English
miles from Carnwath.-The valued rent of the parish is up-

about 5000 L. Sterling.

fall into the river Clyde; Dippool, which divides the parish
nearly into equal parts, and Cleugh Burn, are but small rivu-
lets compared with the Clyde.  There is plenty of trout in
