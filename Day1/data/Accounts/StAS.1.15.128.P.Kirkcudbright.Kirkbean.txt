in Dumfries, then carrying on a considerable trade with Vir-
ginia.  It was afterwards raised to its present height, by the
late Mrs OSWALD of Auchencruive.  This tower, at present,
is of great advantage to the navigation of this coast, and would
still be of greater advantage, were lights placed in it.  As
limestone abounds in its neighbourhood, the sea, every tide,
washing that kind of rock, it is believed, that if here a small
harbour was built, a considerable trade in that line might be
carried on.  Vessels often come to anchor at Salterness, in
3 or 4 fathoms, at low water, in the language of seamen,
"to stop the tide."

   Bay.-CARSETHORN bay on the east shore, and at the mouth
of the river Nith, is considered as a safe anchoring place.
Several palls of wood for vessels to make fast to, have been
put in the beach by the town of Dumfries, who levy a sum
for tonage, from all vessels discharging their cargoes upon
this shore.  All vessels from Dumfries, when meeting with
contrary winds, anchor in this bay.  Vessels bound for Dum-
fries frequently lye in the bay, until the spring tides surnish
them with water sufficient to carry them up.  Ships from the
Baltic, laden with timber for Dumfries, generally unload here,
as vessels, drawing 11 or 12 feet water, cannot always with safe-
ty go above this.  There are 3 fathoms water in the bay, and
out in the channel the water rises 5 fathoms perpendicular.

   Tides.-The courses of the tides are as follows.  Out of
the Nith, the tides run nigh south to the Borron point, for-
merly mentioned; they then take their course westward.
Upon this shore the tides flow 5 hours, and ebb 7.  It is
high water on the full and change days of the moon, at half
past eleven o'clock.  Many sand banks ly off this coast, and
such is the rapidity of the tides that vessels getting aground
