luina, is a beautiful sheet of water, of a regular triangular
form, about 8 miles in circumference, full of trout; having
one castle and several islands, the resort of gulls, cranes, wa-
ter-eagles, and wild-ducks.-Near this lake lay the scene of
an antient Celtic poem, translated by Dr. Smith, called Cath-
luina, or "the conflict of Luina:"  and in the lake is an island,
the scene of another poem, called Laoi Fraoich, or "the death
of Fraoch."-Many places in this neighbourhood are still de-
nominated from Ossian's heroes.  This lake discharges itself
into Lochow by the stream or water of Avich, buried in wood;
having six fine falls, with large circular ponds at the foot of
each, and possessing the peculiarity of never freezing; even
in the year 1740, not a particle of ice was observed on it,
though the lake, from whence it issues, was entirely frozen
over.

   Mode of Cultivation.-The out-field lands are commonly in
6 divisions.  After a tathing, by allowing the cattle to lie up-
on the field at night, and after milking at noon, two or 3 crops
of oats are taken.  The land then lies ley for 3 years.  The re-
turns are commonly from 3 to 4 bolls gray or mixed oats, per
acre.  The infield lands are in 4 divisions:  from one, potatoes
are taken, which are commonly very good; from another di-
vision, bear, likewise good; oats succeed the bear, upon a third
division of the in field or winter town land, but are not good; and
the fourth division is ley.  The most industrious, who begin to
know the use of lime, which they have in plenty, sow white in-
stead of gray oats; and have upon their infield land pretty good
crops.  Would they be persuaded to pay particular attention to
the raising of potatoes and other green crops from their in fields,
with as much bear, hay, and oats, as they can properly dress
and manure, and allow their distant out-fields to lie entirely in
pasture, they would certainly find it their interest.  The ex-
