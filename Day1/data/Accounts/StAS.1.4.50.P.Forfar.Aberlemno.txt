     Statistical Account

rent of the parish is fully L. 2000 sterling.  The number
of ploughs is 48, each of which is generally drawn by
four horses; the number of horses 161; of carts 90.
There has been little sale of land from time immemo-
rial.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The air, in most places is
healthy.  There is plenty of moorstone, free-stone and
slates; many of which last, are sent to London and o-
ther places.  Coal, peat, turf, broom and furze, are used
for fuel.  Coal from Fife costs 6 d. the boll, i. e. 7 stone
weight.  Peat is got from a neighbouring parish, at about
2 s. the cart-load.  There are 2 chaises in the parish.
Two obelisks remain, one in the church-yard, another
on the highway from Brechin to Forfar, about 8 or 9
feet high; they were erected in memory of the total de-
feat of the Danes, and have some rude hieroglyphical
sculptures*.  A few tumuli have been opened in this
neighbourhood, in one or two of which was found a
rude kind of stone coffin, containing a small quantity of
black earth, with some bones almost entirely consumed.
In 1777, there was a cut made the whole breadth of this
parish, from the church southward; and a bridge built
by private subscription, to connect the road from Forfar
to Brechin with that to Arbroath.  The statute-labour
has been, for the most part, commuted.  The principal
manufacture is linen.  Few inlist in the army.  The peo-
ple are industrious, economical, and, in general, humane
in their disposition.  There is a great alteration for the
better, in the manners, dress and style of living within these
40 years.  The parish always supplies itself with provisions
