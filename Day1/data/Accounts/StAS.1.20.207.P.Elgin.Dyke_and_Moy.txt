   Day-labour.-Summer and harvest wages for men 1 s.;
for women 9 d.  Winter wages for trenching, ditching, or
planting, 8 d. to 9 d.; all without victuals.  Hay-cutting 2 s.
6 d. per acre.  Journeymen masons from 1 s. 3 d. to 1 s.
6 d.  Carpenters 1 s. to 1 s. 3 d.

   Services.-Services of tenants are very generally abolish-
ed.

   Manufactures.-Of manufactures there is nothing to say,
but that the harn, tweeling, coarse linen, and plaiden, made
by individuals, are readily bought up at fairs by dealers,
for high prices, and carried away.  The quantities of each
kind not known.

   Article of Commerce.-The chief articles of commerce
are, grain, black-cattle, iced and barrelled salmon, linen-
yarn of the coarser kinds, and wood.

   Grain.-The surplus of grain for export is very consider-
able; of wheat sometimes, of oats and barley always.  Oats
are sold at 5 firlots per boll, wanting only (according to
Bald's Tables) 1 lippy and 5206 of an English quarter.
Barley or farm bear, at 4 firlots, weighs from 17 to 19 stone
Dutch, wanting 1 firlot 1 lippy and 579 of a lippy, of an
English quarter.  A regulation for selling all grain by
weight would do justice to good farmers, make bad farmers
better, and render purchases by commission more secure.
It would be convenient, at the same time, to regulate the
weight of hay, wool, butter, and cheese, and bring the diffe-
rent counties to one standard, that buyers and sellers might
have nothing to differ about, or settle, but the price.
