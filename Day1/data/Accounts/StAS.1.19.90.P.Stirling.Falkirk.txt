     Statistical Account

   The canal remained in this languishing and unfinished
state, till by the assistance of Government, the managers
were enabled to begin their operations again in July 1786.
The work was conducted by Mr Robert Whitworth, and
on the 28th of July 1790, the navigation from sea to sea
was opened.  When, by the intervention of the canal, a
communication between the eastern and western seas was
completed, the event was signalized by the characteristic
ceremony of pouring a hogshead full of the water of the
frith of Forth into the river Clyde* , amidst the shouts and
approbation of an astonished multitude.
   When we consider the novelty of the undertaking, and
the difficulty of the enterprise, we shall not be surprised to
find, that it was 22 years and 18 days in being finished.
The canal in its course passes through marshes, and over
rivers, rivulets, and roads.  There is a considerable aque-
duct bridge, which conveys it over the Glasgow and Stir-
ling road, a little to the westward of Falkirk.  But the
most magnificent is that having four arches, which conducts
it over the river Kelvin, where the valley in which it runs
is 400 feet wide, and the depth from the summit of the
middle arches to the channel of the river is more than 65
feet.
   The side cut, which has already been mentioned, was
carried forward to within half a mile of Glasgow.  Larger
and more commodious basons were made; necessary build-
ings were erected; there is land to be sold for building a
village, and the place is called Port Dundas, in honour of
Lord Dundas.  From this port there is a junction made with
the Monkland Canal, which is a small cut running 12
miles into the country on the east of Glasgow, for the pur-
pose of conveying coals into that city.
