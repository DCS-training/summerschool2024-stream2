     PARISH OF DUNBOG,

     (COUNTY OF FIFE.)

     By Dr GREENLAW, Minister of Criech.

     Name, Situation, Soil, etc.

   THIS parish lies low, between 2 hills, and has a pretty
large bog or morass, one mile long, and about half a
mile abroad, at the W. end of it, from which the name
Dunbog has probably arisen.  It is bounded by Monimail
on the S. and E.; by Abdie on the W.; by Flik on the
N.; by Criech on the E.; and is situated in the presby-
tery of Cupar, and Synod of Fife.  Its length is about 3
miles, breadth 2.  The greatest part of the lands is arable,
but much of them wettish.  They prodce good barley;
great part is capable of bearing wheat; and the tenants are
improving in their mode of culture.  Thre is only 1 flock 
of sheep, of about 13 score, of a pretty large size, brought
hither from the southern parts of Scotland.
