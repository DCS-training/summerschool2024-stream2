of meal, with about a little more than 5 acres of arable
ground for a glebe, little nmore than an acre of grass, a
manse, garden and offices.  The funds for the poor are
not great, though the number on the poor's roll is con-
siderable, there being just now about 30.  There is a mor-
tification of 3 1/2 bolls of meal, at 9 stone boll, payable
yearly off a small farm.  One hundred merks, besides,
were motified by a farmer of the name of M'Erron;
another hundred merks by one of the name of Green;
both which sums, with any savings made in years of
plenty are lent out upon interest, and amount now to
about L. 80 Sterling of capital.  The annualrent of this,
with the above mentioned mortified meal, the weekly col-
lections, amounting to about 2 s. Sterling, at an average,
each Sabbath, with the produce of the mort-cloth, and
any fines for immoralities, are all the funds for assisting this
numerous roll.  Indeed, in 1782, it was necessary, by rea-
son of the scarcity, to diminish the capital; but since that
time it has been raised to what it is at present.

   Price of Provisions and Labour.-The prices of victuals

Meal, which before that period, would have been bought
at 8 s. 4 d. the boll, now sells at 11 s. or 12 s.; beefs, which
formerly fold at 1 1/2 d. a pound, now gives 3 d or 4 d.;
eggs,which were bought at 1 d. for 14, cost now 1 1/2 d.
for 12 and fish, which would have been bought at 5 d.
the dozen, now cost 1 s.; so in proportion with respect
to every sort of provisions.  The same proportion holds
with respect to clothes and shoes; yet the people seem sa-
tisfied with their condition, live very comfortably, being
generally very industrious, and receive a proportional high
price for any commodity they bring to market; and the
