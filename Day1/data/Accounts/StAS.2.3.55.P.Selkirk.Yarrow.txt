chial teachers have the legal accommodations, with the maximum of
salary between them; of which L. 31, 6s.  6 5/4 d. is allotted to the
school at Yarrow, and L. 20 to that at Ettrickbridge; the fees at
the former amounting to about L. 10 per annum; and to L. 12 at
the latter.  The general expensc of education per annum, may be
rated at from 8s. to 12s., exclusive of books and stationary.  One of
the, private schools is particularly necessary to accommodate the
families in the uplands of Yarrow, and were well worthy of aid from
those proprietors whose estates are contiguous.  There are still two
points in the parish, Ashieteel and Redfrogreen, so remote from
the existing school, as to prevent attendance on any of them,--
being five miles across the hills from the nearest.  The popula-
tion around each of these points does not, however, exceed seventy
individuals.  There is also a Sabbath school at Ettrickbridge.
   Libraries.-- A circulating library is established in the parish
while many of the farmers and others are connected with those in
Selkirk.  A few years ago, the shepherds had a Debating Society
among themselves, which, owing to their distance from one another,
has been discontinued.
  Saving Bank.-- A savings bank was established at Selkirk in
1815, of which a branch exists in Yarrow.  At present the amount
of money belonging to the parish in the treasurer's hands is L. 120;
and on air average of the last seven years, L. 29 has been annually
lodged, and L. 37 withdrawn.  The investments are usually made
by servants, of whom the greater part are females.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-- The poor are supported chiefly
by legal assessment, that method having been introduced in 1751.
Some parts of its progress may be noticed.

   The cases of the poor who are maintained at their own houses,
are considered twice in the year.  The usual allowance for each
child is Is. and each aged pauper 2s. 6d. per week.  The average of
church collections expended in gratuities, education, &c. is L. 10;
donations tnd legacies, L. 4.  It appears that, shortly after the
introduction of the poor's rate, the numbers on the list had attained
