frith, and the fishing and pilot boats of Peterhead.  There
is 11 feet depth of water at stream-tides in this harbour.
The channel is narrow.
   The South Harbour is rendered much more commodious
than it was formerly by the channel being deepened.  There
are now two excellent piers on the south and west sides of
the harbour, and they form with the Quenzie, or Keith
Inch, on the east side, a capacious bason, where at present
above 60 ships may remain in great safety, and with some
additional expence in clearing the channel, and erecting
another pier or quay on the east side, I am informed it may
contain about 100 vessels.
   The south pier, which sustains the whole force of the
German Ocean, (and at some times, from the waves that
break over the parapet, the appearance is very grand and
tremenduous), is 460 feet in length, 42 feet wide at the
broadest part, 40 feet high from the foundation of the head
to the top of the parapet.  The west pier is 633 feet in
length, the parapet-wall 325 feet; the height at the head
from the foundation to the top of the parapet-wall is 26
feet.
   They are both of large pieces of granite, squared and
neatly dressed, and are thought of sufficient strength
and firmness (with a little attention) to resist the force of
the sea:   the foot-path and quay is broad and commodious,
and the workmanship on the whole is well executed.
   The two piers, with expences in deepening the harbour,
have cost the town above L. 5000 Sterling; of this they
have received about L. 4000 from Government, the Go-
vernors of the Merchant Maiden Hospital, and contribu-
tions from a few individuals.  The depth of water is from
12 to 14 feet at stream-tides, and from 8 to 9 feet at neap-
tides.
