   Manufactures.-Kilmarnock is one of the principal manufac-
turing tows in Ayrshire, and, for many years has carried on
a very considerable trade.  Manufactures were at first gradual-
ly introduced, but of late have made a very rapid progress.
   About fifty years ago, the principal trade was carried on
by three or four individuals, who bought serges and other
woolen articles from private manufactures, and exported
them to Holland.  When the demand afterwards increased,
a company was formed, who erected an woollen factory for
different branches of that business, which ever since has con-
tinued in a very flourishing state.  The shoe trade was introdu-
ced about the same time; and now the woollen and shoe trades
are the most extensive and important in the district.  Several
spinning jeanics, however, for cotton, have been lately erected,
and a carding and spinning machine for coarse wool; all of
which seem to do very well.
   The following is an account drawn up by the most intelli-
gent manufacturers in the town, of the present annual ave-
rage value of the different branches carried on in Kilmar-
nock.
