The south end of Loch-Lomond is surrounded by part
of it; but a description of that like will more properly
belong to another parish.  This part of the lake, with the
Leven which issues from it, divide the parish nearly into two
equals parts.

   River.-The Leven, though not so large as the Tweed of
the Tay, may be reckoned amongs the large rivers in Scot-

owing to its windings, will more than 9 miles.  The fall
from the lake to the Clyde is 29 feet.  The river is notwith-

up the river more than a third of its lenght; and where the
tide fails, the vessels are drawn up the river with horses,
These vessels are constructed long and narrow, on purpose for
the navigation of the Leven, in order to draw little water.
They are chiefly employed in bringing coals and lime, and
other heavy articles, to the manufacturers, and to the gentle-
men who reside upon the banks of the Leven and of the lake;
and in carrying down the wood and barks that grow upon the
banks, with slates from the slate quarries in the parish of
Luss.

   Fish-The Leven produces salmon, parr, and a variety of
trout, and other small fish.  The salmon it produces are
