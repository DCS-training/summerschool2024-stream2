				V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	Town.--In 1451 James II. erected Biggar into a free burgh of
barony "with all privileges, and particularly a weekly market
on Thursday." New erections of it were made in 1526, 1588, 1634,
and 1662. Biggar is the seat of a Presbytery, and of the Court of
Justices, who meet four times a-year. It consists of one very wide
street, stands on rising ground, enjoys a fine southern exposure
and might be a pretty little town if common sewers were provided
to drain away the nuisance which at present stagnates on the street.
In 1831 it contained 1454 inhabitants. It contains at present among
others 210 weavers, 28 shoemakers, 26 masons, 20 tailors, 14 join-
ers, 4 mill-wrights, 2 wheel-wrights, 2 coopers, 8 blacksmiths, 8
nailors, 2 tinsmiths, 4 watchmakers, 20 carters 6 sawyers, 1 um-
brella-maker, 1 painter, 1 plasterer, 2 staters, 5 saddlers, 7 ped-
ers, 1 veterinary surgeon, 1 nurseryman, 1 brewer, 16 spirit-deal-
ers, 5 of whom are innkeepers and the rest grocers, 9 bakers,
3 butchers, 18 cloth-merchants. There are four surgeons. Some
idea may be formed of the retail trade of Biggar by the following
quantities of excisable articles sold during the year ending 5th July
