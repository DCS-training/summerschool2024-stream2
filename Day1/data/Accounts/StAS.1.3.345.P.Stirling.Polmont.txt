called), is flat, pretty extensive at low water, and covered
with sleetch.  There are several considerable quarries of 
free-stone, two of which are constantly wrought for building,
and employ from 12 to 14 men.  There are also several coal
mines, chiefly belonging to the duke of Hamilton.  The
principal one is that at Shieolahill, in the moor south from
Falkirk, which is let in lease to the Carron Company, and 
produces about 500 tons per week, of a remarkably fine qua-
lity.  This coal work employs about 250 people, men, wo-
men, and children, and from 40 to 50 horses.  It yields, to
the proprietor, about 500 L. per annum; besides the profit of
the iron-stone, which is wrought from the old coal-pits, and
is sold to the Carron Company at 10 d. per stone weight,
above the expence of working it, and affords constant employ.
ment to about a dozen of people.

   Population-According to the report sent to Dr Webster
in 1755, the population then amounted to 1094 souls.  It

part reside in the country, there being only a few houses
near the church, and about 50 families who have seus on the 
turnpike road, which lies south from it.  The average of 
births, for these last five years, is 64; of deaths, during the
same period, 53, and of marriages, 22.  The average num-
ber of persons to each family is 31, there being 400 houses
in the parish, and not one of them uninhabited.  Of these
there are ten, which may be properly faled miles being pos-
sessed by gented families, but without any great extent of 
property.  The building of these houses, and the concomi-
tant improvements of the country, occupying a demand for
labourers, have been the chief causes of increasing the po-
pulation, as well as of preventing emigrations, of which
