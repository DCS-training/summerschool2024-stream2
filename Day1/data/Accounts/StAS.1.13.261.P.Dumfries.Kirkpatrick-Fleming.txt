<FOOTNOTE>

*The difference between the males and the females in this parish must
strike the most inattentive observer.  This difference must be accounted
for chieftly from the longevity of the female, who on account of her do-
mestic situation and manner of life, being less exposed to irregularity and
accidents, may be said to enjoy a greater certainty of life than the male.
This opinion is confirmed by the striking difference between the widowers
and widows.  A greater number of the males likewise emigrate.  In the
annual average of births for the last 7 years, the males are to the females
in the proportion of 20 to 19 1/2.
