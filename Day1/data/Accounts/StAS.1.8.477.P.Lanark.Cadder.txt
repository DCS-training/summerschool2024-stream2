raised from 1 acre.-But flax is the most advantageous crop
here: 200 acres are sown annually; and this year (1792),
one farmer has sown 30 acres with flax seed: 32 stones of good
scutched flax have been raised from 1 acre, and sold at a guinea
the stone; a price perhaps equal to the value of the land on
which it grew.  Riga flax seed, and the finest kinds of Dutch
feed are mostly sown here; though some good crops of flax
have been raised from Boston flax seed.  On rich moist soil,
the finest flax is raised from American seed.  Fine Dutch, and
large plump America flax seed are reckoned to agree best with
this climate.  The quantities, commonly sown on 1 acre, are,
9 1/2 pecks Dutch, 8 1/2 Riga, and 8 America flax seed; this last
being much smaller than the others.-The improvements in
agriculture, in this neighbourhood, are much owing to the
Great Canal*.  Before it was erected, neither spade nor bar-
row was used to any purpose.  Now, the wheel-barrow,
plank, and spade, are found at every farmer's door; and, by
the proper use of there utensils, much work is expeditiously
performed.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The whole of this parish, excepting the
barony of Cadder, and the Midtown of Bedlay, formerly be-
longed to the subdeanry of Glasgow.  The Bishop's Land was
called the Baldermonoch Ward (or Monk's Town), and com-
prehends ten townships; each of which contains 8 ploughgates
of land.  The mill of Bedlay is still the joint property of
these 10 townships.  From this ecclesiastical tenure, are derived
the names of several places in the parish; such as, the Bishop's
Bridge, the Bishop's Moss, and the Bishop's Loch.-After

*The only objection to the Great Canal, is, that it has been fatal to so
many.  No fewer than seven, within the bounds of this parish, have been
drowned in it since it was opened.
