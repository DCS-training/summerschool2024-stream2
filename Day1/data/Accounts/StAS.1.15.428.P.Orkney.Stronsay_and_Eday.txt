skill of all the doctors to whom this poor girl's parents had access; at least,
every medicine which could be procured, was ineffectual to obtain for her any
case or relief from trouble.
   Another extraordinary case, is, of a young girl in the same island of Stron-
say, whose name is Isabel Sinclair ú Her father possesses a small farm as sub-
tenant:  His affairs have been embarrassed, and his family reduced to straits
by his daughter's illness.  In November 1785, at eight years of age, when
going to a well for water, she was instantaneously struck with what was sup-
posed to be the palsy She was carried to her father's house speechless, and
almost totally destitute of the use of her limbs, and seemed to have little or
no exercise of her mental faculties; she was afterwards entirely confined to her
bed.  During which confinement, she was sometimes lifted up and catered to an
elbow chair, where she fat for some hours, and behoved to be carried back

she was averse to take medicines of any fort, which, however, were often pro-
cured for her, in hopes that they would contribute to her recovery; and, when
she took them, they had no influence on her state of health.  In the month, of
November 1793, after a violent and painful struggle one night, she, to the
great joy of her parents, and to the astonishment of all who bad seen or heard
of her singular malady, recovered her speech and the exercise of her mental
faculties; upon which thee soon expressed desire for clean cloaths, and to be
