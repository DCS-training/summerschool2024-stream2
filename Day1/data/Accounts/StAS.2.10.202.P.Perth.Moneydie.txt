ed to exist within the limits of their respective territories.  One
of these wells was in existence forty years ago, and may possibly
be so still.
   The parish of Monevdie belonled originally to the presbytery
of Dunkeld, and was annexed to that of Perth only about eighty
years ago.  From the presbytery seat of the former it is distant
about ten miles, while it is only six from Perth.
   Parish Register, &c.-The parish register goes back as far as
the year 1655, and has been kept with tolerable correctness.  One
volume, however, embracing the period between April 1680 and
August 1717, has been lost.  There is also an important blank
from August 12, 1666, to August 28, 1670, which is supposed to
have been occasioned by the unsettled state of the church at that pe-
riod.  The following is a list of the ministers of this parish, with the
dates of their settlement and death, sQ far as has been ascertained :
David Drummond, ordained May 17,1655; Williams Smythe, or-
dained before 1679 ; Alexander Chapruan, ordained before 1705,
died 1716 ; John Gardner, ordained August 6, 1717, died June 20,
1738; Gilbert Mann, ordained July 19, 1739, died April '30,
1754; Patrick Meek, translated from Rattray, December 26, 1754;
and again translated to Kinnoul July 1761 ; George Fraser, trans-
lated from Redgorton, May 27, 1762, died 1807; James Somer-
ville, ordained 1807, died November 30, 1827 ; the present incum-
bent was ordained August 7, 1828.

                   IIL-POPULATION.

  The population of this parish seems to have been at one time
much greater than it now is.  The causes of decrease may be easi-
ly stated.  In the old parish, within the last fifty years, many popu-
lous hamlets have been completely rooted out, and the small pen-
dicles possessed, by cottagers have been thrown together and form
ed into large farms.  In Logiealmond, where the system of large
farms has not yet been adopted, and where the population is large
in proportion to the soil, any decrease that bas taken place has
been in consequence of emigration. - Within the last eight years,
upwards of 100 persons have emigrated to Canada from Logieal-
mond alone.
  The population is entirely agricultural, with very few excep-
tion.
  Births, Deaths, and Marriaqes.- The yearly average of births
for the last seven years is 17; of marriages 8; and of deaths no
register is kept.  It is proper to remark, however, that the num-
ber of births here given, does not exhibit an accurate average, as
