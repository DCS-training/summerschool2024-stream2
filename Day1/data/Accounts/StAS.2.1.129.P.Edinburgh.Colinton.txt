fully situated on a flat piece of ground lying between the church
and the river, and extending to about three-quarters, of a  Scots
acre. The grebe, which is at a short distance from the manse,
consists of about 7 acres, 3 roods, 20 poles, and is at present
let at L.27 per annum.  The stipend consists of wheat, 92
bushels, 3 pecks, 7 6/10 pints: barley, 355 bushels, 1 peck, 1 gallon,
5 5/10 pints; oats, 573 bushels, 3 pecks, 1 gallon, 5 1/10 pints ; meal,
33 cwt. 32 lbs. 13 oz. 1 8/10 dwt.; and money, L. 20, 3s. 6 10/16d. The
average value of the whole for the last ten years is L. 221.
   There is a chapel at Slateford connected with the United As-
sociate Synod.  It was built in 1774, and is seated for 520.  There
is a dwelling-house and garden prettily situated on the river side
appropriated to the use of the minister.  His allowance, which is
chiefly drawn from the seat rents, is L.130 per annum.  The
debt upon the house is about L.200, but there is no wish on, the
part of the managers to have this diminished.
   The number of families in the parish is 440; of these, 269
are connected with the church, or placed under its superinten-
dence.  The Lord's supper is dispensed in the parish church twice
a-year, and the number of communicants at the summer sacra-
ment is about 340. There are 171 families connected with
Dissenters ; of these, 4 belong to the Episcopal communion,
3 are Papists, 1 is Independent, and the remainder are connect-
ed with one or other of the bodies denominated Seceders.  It is
stated that 323 individuals above twelve years of age in this pa-
rish belong to the congregation at Slateford. According to the
usual mode of providing seat-room for the population, this would
show that 216 sittings were held by inhabitants of Colinton pa-
rish, thus leaving 304 to be supplied from other parts of the
country.  It is understood, however, that the house is not fully let.
   The remainder of the Seceders in the parish betake themselves
to various places of worship in Edinburgh; one great evil result-
ing from which is, that, of necessity, they are left without pastoral
superintendence, as sheep havin no shepherd. Not long ago one
individual in this parish was visited by his minister: " Come awe,
Sir," was the salutation with which the  minister  was  welcomed,
" it is the first time these forty years. But do not think that I
have been neglected a' that time.  I have enjoyed in many a visit
from our parish, minister." It has, indeed, ever been the steady aim
of the present incumbent to minister parochially.  All within the
bounds of his parish he considers as placed under his care, and,
