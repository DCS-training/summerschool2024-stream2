ly, there was no hay made in the island; and indeed there is
hardly any yet, except what the proprietor makes:  but as
the people now see, by the great returns he has had, the be-
nefit of inclosures, the improvement of lowing grass feeds
is likely loon to follow.

   Black Cattle and Horses.-The island of Gigha was for-
merly divided into 30 merks land, to each of which 14 cows
and 4 horses were allowed:  The fame proportion to the island
of Cara, consisting of 1 merk land.  According to this me-
thod of calculation, the number is easily ascertained.

The present number, however, of black cattle and horses far
exceeds this calculation.  The black cattle may be reckoned
at least 1/3 more.  Some fat cows are commonly lent to market
in the beginning of winter, and draw from 3 L. 15 s. to 5
guineas each, The number of black cattle, small and large,
fold annually, will be about 120.  Milk cows fell at 4 L. and
5 L.; lean cows, in May, draw from 2 L. 10 s. to 3 L.; heifers
from 1 L. 10 s. to 2 L. 12 s. 6d.; stirks, or year. olds, from
16 s. to 1 L. 1 s.  Horses bought at 3 L. 10 s. and 9 L., ac-
cording to their age and size.  The number of horses annual-
ly bought tour be very small.  As some are yearly fold out
of the island, it is probable that the number reared is suffi-
cleat for the place.

   Sheep and Swine.-The farms in Gigha are rather confined
for sheep; and as the common tenants cannot keep them re-
