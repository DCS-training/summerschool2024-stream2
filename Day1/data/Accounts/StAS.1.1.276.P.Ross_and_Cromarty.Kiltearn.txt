neral, artificers, mechanics, or day-labourers; and these last
do more justice to their lands, and rear better crops on
their small lots than the poor tenants do on larger posses-

the cottars and mailers in the parish; but of such of them as

with more alacrity.  But the poorer tenants yoke in one
plough, horses, oxen, and cows, promiscuously, which often
exhibit a miserable spectacle, and clearly shews that they are
more solicitous to increase the number, than improve the
quality of their cattle.  Within a dozen years, an improve-
