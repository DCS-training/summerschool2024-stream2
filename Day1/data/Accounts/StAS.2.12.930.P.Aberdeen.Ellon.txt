regarding education in this extended point of view, that we can
form a due estimate of its importance, or appreciate, even with
tolerable accuracy, its influence on national character.  Looking,
then, at the process of education in the comprehensive range now
assigned to it, there are two remarkable features of that process
as it was developed and wrought out at former periods of our his-
tory, which cannot fail to arrest our attention.  The first import-
ant feature that distinguished the ordinary education of former
times was impressed upon it by the circumstance, that almost the
only school books then in use were the Scriptures of the Old and
New Testaments.  The second, which is of kindred character, it re-
ceived from the yet more influential circumstance, that the same
Scriptures, or other religious works, having for their object the
illustration and practical enforcement of scriptural truth, furnish-
ed the principal mental food of maturer years.  Admitting, then,
that the powers of the understanding might not, in the schools of
former ages, be so vigorously exercised as they now are, yet, un-
der the system of tuition which has just been pointed out, it seems
impossible, that the heart should not have received early impres-
sions of the most valuable character: and these impressions once
made, must, in as far as the studies of a riper age could have in-
fluenced them, have continued indelible, since it was the natural
effect of those studies not to efface but to deepen the engraving
originally furrowed out.  The consequence would be, that the
whole man, gradually becoming illumined by the light of scriptu-
ral truth, would almost necessarily be led to contemplate, through
the medium of that light, both the phenomena of nature and the
events of life.  Now, as it has been justly remarked, that the
Bible, overlooking secondary causes, interposes, for the effecting
of every change, the right hand of the Most High, a man thus
educated would feel himself to be ever in a spiritual presence, and
to be surrounded on all sides by those mysterious influences of
which it may be affirmed, that, as the sense of them manifests the
necessity, so does it constitute the strength of faith.  Though such
a man might be ignorant of much that is now held essential to a
finished education, and of much that, when kept in the subordi-
nate place which properly belongs to it, is truly valuable, as open-
ing up new traces of the wisdom and goodness of God,-yet,
in the conscious feeling of an ever-present Deity, in the fer-
vent cherishing of that abiding sense of dependence on the Di-
vine strength, which such a feeling inspires, and in the grateful
