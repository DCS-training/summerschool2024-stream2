one another.  These have been hitherto kept in good repair
by the statute-labour; but it is proposed to convert the statute-
labour into money; and, if that plan is adopted, time will
discover whether it will, or will not, prove advantageous to the
inhabitants and to the public.-There are three bridges
in the parish.  Two of them are built over the water of
Balnagown; the other over a river into which the sea flows
at stream tides, and which, before this bridge was built in
1789, proved very inconvenient to travellers.
   There is an extensive level bed of shells, of diverse kinds,
in the sands of New-Tarbat and Nigg, chiefly the property of
the family of Cromarty, and manufactured into lime by persons
trained up to the business from their infancy.  There are 20
men, with their wives and children, who are employed in this
trade.  At full sea, they go from the shore in boats, cast an-
chor over the bed of shells, and remain there till the sea ebbs;
then all hands begin to dig up the shells and freight the boats;
and they are ready by the time of flood to return to the shore;
this is attempted only in the summer season.  The lime ma-
nufactured from these shells is reckoned an excellent cement
for building, and is peculiarly adapted for plaistering, and finish-
ed work.  There are 8 boats in the parish; 5 of which are
employed in the lime trade for 3 or 4 months:  during the
rest of the year, they either fish on the neighbouring coasts,
or are employed in carrying corn and peats to the opposite
shore.

From that period, little regard is paid to these tumuli:  some of them have been
opened, but nothing found worthy of remark.
