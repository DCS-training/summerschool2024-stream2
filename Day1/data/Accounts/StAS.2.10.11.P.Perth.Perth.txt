ly exceed those in excess, in reference to the average mean for the
whole period. Hence it may be concluded, that the causes which
give rise to a diminished pressure are more sudden, as well as more
powerful in their operation, than those which tend to produce an
opposite condition of the atmosphere; a result which implies that
the causes contributing to a low state of the barometer are of local
extent, and partial operation; and may be satisfactorily explained
by referring them, partly, to a diminution of aerial elasticity, occa-
sioned by the rapid condensation of aqueous vapour; and partly, to
the combustion of large portions of carburetted hxdrogen, in the
upper regions of the atmosphere, over the place of observation.
Hence it may be concluded, that an arithmetical mean between
two observations of the barometer, the one expressing the highest,
and the other the lowest height of the mercury, will rarely give
the true average height for the interval of time between the ob-
servations. This fact, which seems to have hitherto escaped the
notice of meteorologists, is of considerable importance.
   The annual range, or thd difference between the highest and
lowest state of the barometer, in the course of each year, from the
beginning of 1814, to the close of 1822, being a period of nine
years, was as subjoined:

   The mean annual range thus deduced from observations for a
period of nine consecutive years is 2.189 inches; the extreme
range for the same period, being the difference between the high-
est state of the barometer, which took place on the 9th of July
1820, and the lowest state of it, which occurred on the 5th of
March 1818, is 2.821 inches. The greatest change observed to
take placd within a limited period occurred in the year 1820;
when, ten days after the very unusual altitude which the mercurial
column reached on the 9th of January, it sunk to 28.830, being
a chance of 2.244 inches, in that short interval of time. We
have already stated, that the mean height of the barometer at
Perth, deduced from the observations for a period of six years, viz.
