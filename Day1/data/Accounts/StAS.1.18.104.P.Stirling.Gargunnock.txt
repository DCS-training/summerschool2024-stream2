more than forty acres.  Can good houses be expected in such
cases?  The second is, the house is built by the tenant
who is only allowed some timber by the landlord.  It is of
consequence fitted up as superficially as possible.  If it serves
the purpose of a dwelling during the currency of the
lease, nothing more is expected.  For there reasons,
it seems probable, that farm houses will be mean and un-
comfortable, wherever they are built at the expence of ten-
ants of a few acres.  Upon the farm of Redhall, in this pa-
rish, consisting of 100 acres of carse and as much of dryfield,
the property of Mr Seton of Touch, there has been lately
built an exceeding good house of two floors and with a slate
roof and handsome offices, at the expence of the proprietor.
Such houses, though for the present expensive, last for ages,
without the necessity of those repairs, which are incessantly re-
quired for those thatched cottages of half stone and half clay,
which begin to decay almost as soon as they are reared.  It
is to be acknowledged, however, that poor as the carse houses
still are, they are much better than they were twenty years
ago.  They consist at least of two apartments, each having
a chimney and a tolerable window: Nor are the cattle now
permitted as formerly, to enter at the same door with the
family.  If the dunghill, which in many instances is still in
front of the house, were removed to a proper distance
behind it, this would be another step to cleanliness and
health.

   Soil.-There are few fields, either dryfield or carse, uniform-
ly of the same soil.  In the dryfields the soil is chiefly light
and sandy, not unfrequently with a red tilly bottom; but in
some places it is a rich loam, resembling the low or flat
grounds on the banks of the Forth.  In thee carse there is clay
of all colours, but blue is the most prevalent, which is also
