year; and last autumn, at the conclusion of the harvest, the 
age of him, and the two servants that assisted in taking in his
crop, amounted in all to 257; and it is worthy remarking
that one of these has been his servant 50 years.  Mr Wilson

   Rental.-The valued rent of the parish is L. 5489: 6: 8:
Scots.  The present real rent, exclusive of fisheries, is nearly
L. 1680 Sterling.
