the sunk rocks are visible.  Between these points, are several
bays and creeks, where small vesells can be safely moored.  In
the bay of Airdme'anish, at the head of which is the church,
there is good holding ground in 5 and 7 fathom water.  Be-
tween Gigha and Cara lies Gigulum, a small uninhabited
island, with a range of breakers and large rocks running S. W.
In the found between this island and Gigha, there is a good
anchoring place for large vessels, which may be conveniently
moored on the Gigulum side, by means of iron rings fixed in
the rock.  The entrance from the west is between the above
mentioned range of rocks and the island of Gigha, and from
the east between Gigulum and Gigha.

   Tides, Sea Ware, Kelp, etc.-The tide runs north; but
there is no remarkable current near the coast:  nor is it easy to
ascertain at what rate of knots it runs, being a kind of eddy,
that strikes off from the rapid current, which tuns between
the Mull of Kintyre and the Sound of Ilay.  It seldom rises
above 5 1/2 or 6 feet; and that only with a north wind, or in
calm water.  With a south wind, there is hardly a foot of dif-
ference between high and low water.  This is attended with
disadvantages in repairing, loading and unloading large vessels.
It also prevents the manufacturing of kelp to any great ex-
tent; 7 tones, at an average, being the greatest quantity
made in a season*.  There is, however, such abundance of
sea ware thrown ashore in stormy weather, as sufficiently
serves the inhabitants for the purpose of manuring their
ground.  Though shell sand abounds in several parts of the
island, it is never used as a manure, being attended with

<FOOTNOTE>

*Sea ware has not hitherto been cut annually, but at the end of every 3
years.  By getting so much time to grow, the quantity of kelp may be about
21 tons at every cutting of the sea ware.
