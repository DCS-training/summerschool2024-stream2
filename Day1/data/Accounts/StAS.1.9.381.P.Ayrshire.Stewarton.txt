     of Stewartown.

   Miscellaneous and Observations.-The people are mostly of the
usual size, and some considerably above it.  They are in
general a sober intelligent people, hospitable to strangers,
and charitable to the poor, of which several instances could
be mentioned.  There have been some instances of longe-
vity in the parish.  A man died some years ago, who was
about 103, a lady above 97, and a worthy heritor and elder
died lately, who was above 90.  This is a post-town, and has
been so for a long time past.  There is a regular arrival and
dispatch at and from this every day, for all towns in Britain,
and letters come safely here, without having any other post-
office written on them.-David Dale, Esq; late one of the
magistrates of Glasgow, was born and educated in this place.
He is well known in the commercial world for the many ma-
nufactures he has introduced, and carries on with success.  His
piety, humility, and acts of charity, are worthy of imita-
tion.
