the way from the house; and from the attachment of that
lady to this seat in particular, the whole eminence has got,
and still retains, the romantic title of Mary's Bower.  A lime-
stone rock in it, now working, has no other name but Mary's
Bower Quarry.  The winding, path can be traced by a
flowering shrub here and there, dropt since, all its length
westward; and on the east side of the seat, a small stream
precipitates over the lime-stone craggs, amidst birches and
copsewood, to the bottom of the glen, upwards of a hundred

an old coalier, of the name of James Dixon, in March 1787,
on inquiring how the quarry came to get the name of Mary's
Bower; and has since been heard from several others, with
some trilling variations; but from all, this inference is clear,

following the King's army towards Worcester, some parties
from General Monk's detachment, left behind in Scotland,
are said to have been sent to this neighbourhood.  According
to this account, they had a skirmish on the Harleymuir, a
little way east on the other side of the water, and gave the
name of the Steel to a part of it that descends to the lower
banks of the Esk in a point formed by the glen of that river,
and another that enters it from a rock on the south, called
the Harbour Craig.  This circumstance is also said to have dis-
tinguished a stream, that enters the glen of the Esk behind a
cottage, with its rural accompanyments, in several consider-
