being now almost no cottagers in the parish.  The propor-
tion between males and females in the years 1780 and
1781, and at present, shows the advantages of peace, and
the flourishing state of our manufactures.  At the former
period, in consequence of the American war, trade was
dull, and many young men enlisted in the army, or left the
country in quest of employment; but there is now more
work at home than hands.  The number of births and
deaths cannot be exactly ascertained, as they are not all re-
gistered.  The births, it is believed, are about 100 annual-
ly.  In the year 1788, more than 40 children died of the
small pox.  Inoculation is practised here, but not general-
ly, owing to its having proved fatal in one or two instances.
The average number of marriages for 8 years past, has
been between 32 and 33.  There have been 9 irregular
marriages during the last 6 years.

   Manufactures, etc.-The spinning and manufacturing of
Dutch flax was once a considerable article of trade in the
town of Strathaven, but has been on the decline ever since
the introduction of the cotton manufacture.  About 15
years ago, from 12 to 15 hands were constantly employed
in dressing flax; now there are not more than 2 or 3 em-
ployed in it The principal employment of the women
then was spinning, and they were famous for making fine
yarn.  A considerable part of the yarn was manufactured
for the behoof of people in the place, and the remainder was
carried to the great manufacturing towns.  Now the weavers
are almost wholly employed by the Glasgow and Paisley
manufacturers, and cotton yarn is the principal material.
Great numbers of young women too are employed, by the
same people, in flowering muslin.  There are upwards of 300
looms in the town of Strathaven, and about 30 more in the
country part of the parish, and yet it is with great difficulty
