feeding System has occasioned a considerable extension of the out-
houses; and almost every farm of 20 acres and upwards is provid-
ed with a thrashing-mill.  Very few hedges have been planted;
but most of the fields are enclosed with dry-stone dikes, the ma-
terials for which are abundant.  The most marked improvements
are found in the rearing of superior stock, subsoil and trench-
ploughing, reaping with the scythe, draining, enclosure, and judi-
cious cropping.  It is much to be desired, however, that the roads
in general were kept in better condition by those to whom this
matter belongs, especially considering that the materials may be
so readily procured.

   In 1831, along with a cencus Of the population, an account of
the live-stock was taken as follows, viz. 420 horses, 2921 cattle,
463 sheep, and 205 pigs.
   Most of the farmers are members of the Buchan Agricultural
Association, which, by its meetings, and by its premiums for choice
stock and grain raised in the district, and for superior ploughing,
has done much to advance improvement.  To these premiums
may be added those given by Mr Bruce of Innerquhomry and
Longside, to servants who have continued for some time in one
place and maintained a good character; an encouragement most
creditable to the donor, and well worthy of imitation.

the church.  There are two villages, distant two miles and a-half,
Longside and Mintlaw, in the latter of which is the post-office.
At Longside, markets for cattle and horses are held twice,-at
Mintlaw six times,-and at Lenabo, in the south-west corner
thrice in the year.  The parish is crossed by two turnpike roads,
viz. that from Aberdeen to Fraserburgh, which passes through
Mintlaw, and that from Peterhead to Banff, which passes through
Longside, and crosses the other at Mintlaw.  On the former, a
