*As even the small sum payable to the session-clerk on these occasions,
is an object to people struggling with poverty, it has been hitherto found
impracticable to keep an exact register of baptisms, marriages and burials.
The variation that has taken place in the population of this parish, within
the short space of 14 years, has arisen from the following causes.  The de-
crease from 1780 to 1789, was occasioned, in a great measure, by the ar-
rears of rent, and other debts unavoidably incurred by the tenants, through
the failure of crop 1782, which obliged them, in 1783, to dismiss every
servant they could possibly spare, and make their children endeavour to
supply their places, at a much earlier period than they were wont to do
before, and ever since that memorable ‘ra, many of the young and stout-
est lads, have annually gone to Glasgow, and other places in the W. and
S. of Scotland, where the price of labour is high, instead of marrying and
settling in the parish, as was the custom formerly.  This annual drain of
young men, has raised the wages of servants, and is severely felt by the te-
nants.
The increase of population from 1789 to 1792, was owing to the great
encouragement given by Mr. and Mrs. Urquhart of Braclangwell and
Newhall to people who settled on, and improved moor-ground.
