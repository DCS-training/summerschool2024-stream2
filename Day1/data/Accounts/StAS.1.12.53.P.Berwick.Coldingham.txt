and their whole dung and fulzie was always bestowed on the
turnip fallow.
   Their chief object is to have the lands laid down into grass
in good heart, and it will improve every year, if pastured with
sheep; and after a farm is improved, in manner above writ-
ten, our farmers have never less than half of it in grass, and
some of them two-thirds; because they find that such rich
grass fields bring them as much profit as their corn fields do.
If so, the lands must be in the highest condition, and may be
kept so by prudent management, at no considerable expense.
It is by too many corn crops, and too frequent crops of hay,
that lands are deteriorated, to prevent which should be the
chief attention of landlords and their managers.  No sensible
honest farmer will ever attempt to injure or run out his farm
by scourging crops, towards the end of his tack; and no
pricious fool will ever find such dishonest means profitable.
By departing from the old, and adopting this new system of
management, our farmers have reaped profits equal to their
expectations; their corn fields have been far more productive,
and their stocking of all kinds bring them more than triple
the prices they were sold at, before their farms were so im-
proved.  Of late years, they have fold their hogs at or above
20 s. a-head; their two-years old from 25 s. to 30 s.; and
their older sheep between 30 s. and 40 s., and some at higher
prices.  No pains nor expenses have been spared to procure
the breed both of black cattle and sheep fittest for their seve-
ral pastures.  In small farms, where there are no sheep, the
tenants let their turnip crops from 2 l. to 4 l. the acre.  The
turnip belonging to the greater farmers are eaten by their
own sheep.  Our best landlords have no scruple to let their
farms to good farmers for 25 to 31 years, where the farms
are not improved; and indeed no tenant will take a lease of
any shorter duration, where he has the farm to improve at his
