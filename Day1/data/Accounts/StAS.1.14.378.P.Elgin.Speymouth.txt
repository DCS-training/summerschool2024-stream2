*The parish register was kept by a Former minister, from the 1731 to
the 1750; and as it has every appearance of uncommon accuracy, it may
be proper to insert some notes from it here.
   The number of souls in the parish in the year 1736, is stated to be 994,
of which the examinable persons are 844; the children not examinable
150.  The average of baptisms for a year, of 9 years, of which the above
year (1736) is the middle, that is, from 1732 to 1740, inclusive, is 35
7-9ths.  The number of males baptised during all these years is 162; of
females, is 160.  The average of marriages for the same time is 8.  The
average of burials is 24 1-9th; of which there is about 1-5th more of fe-
males than males; viz. males 10 8-9ths, females 13 2-9ths.  A greater
number of years is not taken, because the register is not complete before
the year 1732, and because, in the 1741 and 1742, there is an extraordi-
nary number of deaths, no less than 112 for these 2 years.  This uncom-
mon mortality is to be accounted for, partly from the small pox which
raged at that time.  But it may probably be also accounted for, in some
measure, from the great failure in crop 1740.  It is said in the parish re-
cord, that a fast was appointed by the synod in November 1740, on ac-
count of the threatened famine.  From the same cause, perhaps, the bap-
tisms are so few in 1742.
