over them, which had given occasion to the name.  But they
might make use of a word in their own language, such as
Bertha, to signify that the town appeared to them an illustri-
ous piece of work.
   Other occasions of the name may be conjectured. Per-
haps the Goddess Victoria was by the Romans worshipped in
a particular manner at Perth.  Or, perhaps the Victorian
legion might have a principal residence there, either while
Agricola was governor, or in the next century, when the
Romans were again on the north side of the Forth, and con-
tinued there 30 years.

   SS3. The name St. Johnston.

   The Picts, after they were converted to the Christian re-
ligion, or the Scots, after their king had succeeded to the
Pictish throne, consecrated the church and bridge of Perth to
St John Baptist, whom they seem also to have chosen tutelary
saint of the town.  In process of time many persons gave to
the town the name of St Johnston.  But it was never so called
in any of the public writs, nor by the inhabitants in general.

   SS4. Seals, or Armorial Bearings of the Town.

   A common seal belonged to the Burgh of Perth, in the
reign of Alexander II, and perhaps long before.  I have seen
no copy of it, and therefore know not whether it was the same
which was afterwards used.
   Many impressions of the seal, which was used from about
the year 1400, are appended to charters which belonged to
the religious houses at Perth.  On the obverse, it represented
the decollation of St John Baptist; Salome standing by with
a platter in her hand, to receive the head.  On the reverse, it
represented the same saint inshrined; and a number of priests,
or other persons, kneeling before him.
