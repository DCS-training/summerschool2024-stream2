   Soil and Agriculture.-The soil of the parish is various.
The agriculture is, on the whole, pretty well conducted.
Though the parish is of small extent, yet there are generally
from 60 to 70 acres of turnips, and 300 acres of sown
grass.  This parish was one of the first in the north of Scot-
land in which the new husbandry was attempted, and car-
ried on with success.  The late Earl of Findlater was the
author of all these early improvements.  The farm of
Craigholes was first improved by his Lordship about 1754;
and after improving this farm, to shew what could be done,
he took every method of exciting his tenants to follow his
example.  He gave them long leases of 38 years and a life-
time.  A better method could not have been devised.  The
certain period of 38 years gave his tenants a security for
carrying on their improvements.  The uncertain period at
which the lease terminated, naturally deterred them from
scourging their farms when once improved, because every
man flatters himself with the hopes of a long life.  From the
example and the encouragement of Lord Findlater, the
face of this and some of the neighbouring parishes was
speedily altered.  But though turnip and green crops were
encouraged, and flour-mills were built, yet a regular rota-
tion of crop has not been established, nor has much wheat
been raised in this district.  It is probable, however, that
the high prices of flour will occasion wheat to be raised in
greater quantities, though for a light soil a crop of turnips,
and another of bailey, is less scourging, and generally more
productive than the south country practice of fallow and
wheat.

   Rent.-The rent of the parish is mostly in victual, and
varies from L. 1000 to L. 1200.
