   Where the rocks are laid bare by the action of the tide on the
beach, many features interesting to the geologist may be seen.
There is a fine specimen of a trap dike separating the strata, and
lifting one side three or four feet, which may be seen at low wa-
ter near an old limekiln, about half a mile to the eastward of King-
horn, and there is a sandstone rock situated opposite Abden House,
a little to the east of the churchyard, which, within a space of
150 or 200 feet, changes gradually from sandstone to quartz rock.
There are also specimens, in different parts of the parish, of por-
tions of coal, and shaley strata, being included among the unstra-
tified rocks, and in their burnt or changed appearance present-
ing plain marks of the action of beat.
   The soil along the shore, and to a considerable extent north-
wards, is formed from the trap rock, of a dark deep loam, and is
equal to the richest stratb land in any part of Scotland.

                    II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   The town of Kinghorn was of such importance as early as Da-
vid I., that that monarch conferred upon it the privileges of a
royal burgh. This grant was confirmed by Alexander III. It
was long distinguished by a royal residence; Glammis Castle or
Tower, which stood upon the rising ground that overlooks the
town. While royalty had its residence here, it is natural to sup-
pose that it attracted many distinguished individuals to live at
Kinghorn; and hence we find, in the charters granted by Wil-
liam Lion (1171), the names of William de Mortimer, Gal-
fred de Malleville\f and others "ap. Kingorn;" as witnesses to
the deed, along with the Bishop of Dunkeld and the Chancellor

<FOOTNOTE> This plant has hitberto only been found in one spot in Ireland, on rocks in the
Island of Hoy, and at Seafield in this parish. It has no leaves, and hardly any root.
It is about six or eight inches high, and the whole plant is of a rich red-brown, some-
what viscid to the touch, and of a sweet smell.
<FOOTNOTE>Is not this Galfred de Malleville the ancestor of the Melvilles of Raith and
Kinghorn, and whose representative is the present Earl of Leven and Melville?
