The cheese made in the parish will bear a comparison in point of
quality with any in the district.
  The duration of the leases is from fourteen to nineteen years.
In many cases, there is a break in the middle of the lease, that
may be taken advantage of by either party. The rents are in ge-
neral paid by a stipulated sum of money, though in some instances,
they are paid one-third money, and two-thirds cheese and meal,
according to the fiars prices.
   The farm-steadings, in general, are after the form of a continu-
ous line of building, which is not the most convenient for dairy

others that stand very much in need of being rebuilt. The new
steadings are for the most part in the form of a square. The great-
er part of the parish is enclosed with hedgerows.
   The wages of ploughmen are from L. 10 to L. 14 a year, and

   There are three corn-mills, and a wheat-mill in the parish, also
a carding-mill and dye-work.
   The valued rent of the parish is L. 3864, 2s. 8d. The real rent

and beautiful manufacture of wooden snuff-boxes, which has been
