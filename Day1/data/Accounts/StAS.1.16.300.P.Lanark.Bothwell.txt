   Situation and Extent.-Bothwell was a great, noble and
ancient barony, extending from Clyde to West Lothian.
It is situated in the nether ward of the county of Lanark,
in the presbytery of Hamilton, and Synod of Glasgow
and Ayr: bounded upon the S. by the Clyde, and part of
South Calder; on the W. and N. by North Calder; on
the E. by the Shotts.  It is of an oval figure, extending
from W. to E. broadest toward the middle, and contracted
at both ends; about eight miles and a half in length, and
four at the greatest breadth.
   The great road from Glasgow to Edinburgh goes through
the whole length of the parish, and divides it nearly into
two equal halves; enters it at the west point, by a bridge
over the Calder, about a quarter of a mile north from
where it joins the Clyde, and 5 1/2 miles from Glasgow.  Af-

ably towards the east, as it approaches the high lands of
