century, when the minister made application for an augmentation of stipend, the
heritors of Dunrod and Galtway opposed it, upon this ground, that these parishes
could not afford it, "being a mere waste."  From this severe blow, the country
parish has never yet regained its former population; nor is it probable, from the
large and extensive farms, into which it is now divided, that it will, for many
years to come.  But the noble Lord did not only essentially injure the population
of the parish, by his loyalty, but also so sunk and deranged his fortune, that soon
after his death, anno 1664, his estate was delivered up to his creditors.

++ The deaths, in 1792, cannot be compared with those of former years, as
no register of deceased persons has been kept.  Neither can the births be accu-
rately compared; because, from the great extent of the parish, and the occasional
absence of the minister, children are sometimes christened by other ministers;
and from the parents neglecting to register them, the names of a few are left un-
recorded.  They may, however, safely be taken, at an average for the last 4
years, at 65.  The exact number, both of births and deaths, being accurately
taken, at the visitation in 1792, may be perfectly depended upon.

§ The following instances of longevity, it may be proper here to insert.  In
1784, a woman died in Kirkcudbright, who was a native of the place, aged 103.
Except the loss of her sight, she retained her other faculties till within a few
months of her death.  And on the 28th of November 1792, William Marshall,
