   Advantages and Disadvantages.-It is no small advantage to
this district, that the river Eden is navigable nearly to what is
called the Inner-bridge; a little below which with the con-
currence and assistance of some of the heritors, the tenants
have built upon the north bank of the Mulltree-burn, com-
monly called Mothry water, a wall perpendicular on the side
of the water, and have filled up the ground behind the wall
in such a manner, as to make it easy for carts to approach the
wall where they may load and unload small vessels: This gives
opportunity of importing what the inhabitants stand in need
of, and exporting whatever they can spare.  Carriers from St
Andrews to Dundee pass and repass twice every week through
the village of Leuchars.  Carriers from all the towns of the
south coast, from Crail to the Ely, pass once in 14 days; per-
haps oftener in summer.  Carriers from Dundee and St An-
drews to Edinburgh, going through Cupar the county town,
pass within a mile of the village.  Thus, an easy and regular
intercourse is maintained between all those distant places,
and what we wish to send, or desire to have from them, is
conveyed at the ordinary expence of carriage, according to
the weight.
   The inhabitants of this district derive no small advantage
from the shell-fish in the river Eden.  They gather cockles
and muscles in their different seasons, sometimes eat them by
themselves, sometimes prepare them with potatoes, or onions;
and the high flavoured juice that is obtained from the fishes in
the boiling with a little seasoning, makes a truly wholesome
and delicious meal.
