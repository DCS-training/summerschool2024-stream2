nity of the city of Glasgow, a portion of that spirit of enter-
prise, which possesses all ranks there, has diffused itself hither.
Three bleachfields have lately been erected, which employ a
considerable number of persons.  These belong to companies
stationed at Glasgow, who send their goods here to be
bleached.  Nothing can excel the softness and pureness of
the water for this purpose, being broken by rushing from the
hills and precipices, and filtered through beds of the cleaness
sand.  The ground also on the banks of the river, affords
the most favourable situations for spreading cloth.  Consisting
of a warm sandy soil, it contributes towards whitening and
clearing the goods sooner, and to a more exquisite pureness,
than can be done where the soil below is of a clayish texture.
The chief employment of one field is bleaching muslins and
pullicates.  The other two belonging to inkle factories in
Glasgow, are wholly confined to bleaching tapes and yarn.

   Mechanics.-Of these weavers constitute the greatest pro-

looms employed in this manner; besides 10 inkle looms lately
set to work, at one of the bleachfields above mentioned.  Of
other tradesmen, there are 7 taylors, 3 shoemakers, 3 hosiers,
3 carpenters, and 1 smith.

   Population.-There being a great many feuars or small he-
ritors, who reside upon and labour their own lands, this pa-

its inhabitants, than might otherwise have happened.  It has
however experienced some changes in this respect.  A con-
siderable diminution of numbers has been produced, within
the last 20 or 30 years; by the greater proprietors letting out
