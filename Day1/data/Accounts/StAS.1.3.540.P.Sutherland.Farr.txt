   Small possessors do the work of labouring servants them-
selves.

   The population is not materially different from what it was
5, 10, or 20 years ago.  Each marriage produces, at an ave-
rage, from 4 to 5 children.  In 1772, there were 77 persons
who emigrated to North Carolina, and others have been
going annually since to the south of Scotland.  Some have
left the parish for want of employment.

   Cattle.-This parish is well adapted for rearing cattle.  In
good seasons, most of the farms could keep a greater num-
ber; but a bad season carries them off.  There are generally
from 1000 to 1500 black cattle on the meadow of Mudale
in a season; and sometimes 2000, betwixt 20th June and
20th August, besides about 200 horses, 660 sheep, and 200
goats.  This meadow is two English miles in length, and
half a mile in breadth.
