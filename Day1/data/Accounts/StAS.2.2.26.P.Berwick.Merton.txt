                     PARISH OF MERTON.

       PRESBYTERY OF LAUDER, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE.

                REV. JAMES DUNCAN, MINISTER.


            I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name, Boundaries, &c.-IN the immediate vicinity where the
old village stood there is a piece of marshy ground. Perhaps
from this, both the village and parish may have been designated
Mire-town or Mertoun. The parish is situated in the south-west
corner of Berwickshire. It is bounded on the south by the river
Tweed, on the north by Earlston, and on the east by Smailholm
and Makerston. In length the parish may be about six miles,
and in breadth from two to three.
   Topographical Appearances, 8fc.-The western part of the parish
stands high, and is extremely picturesque. From Bernersyde hill,
the property of Jaynes Haig, Esq. over which one of the most
public roads in the parish passes, the eye of the traveller is at once
gratified with every thing beautiful and magnificent,-wood, water,
hills, ruins, and fertile fields. The rest of the parish gradually
declining to the south is also extremely pleasant, the prospect
being agreeably diversified by excellent enclosures, beautiful hedge-
rows, and thriving plantations. The soil towards the Tweed, par-
ticularly the haughs, is sharp, with a gravelly bottom. Towards
the north, and indeed through the rest of the parish, with very few
exceptions, is a stiff clay with a till bottom.
   There are no lakes in the parish, and very few springs; conse-
quently, in very dry seasons, the farmers are sometimes at a loss
for water to their cattle.
   The rocks are all greenstone and other trap-rocks, except on
the banks of the Tweed, where they are deposits of old red sand-
stone. This latter stone is very durable, and admits of the high-
es polish.
                     II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   It may deserve notice, that Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden, hav-
ing purchased the library of his grandfather, the Right Honourable
