MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS-
In conclusion, I cannot say that the general appearance of the
parish has materially varied since the last Statistical Account was
drawn up.  The proprietors have no doubt greatly improved around

their family mansions    but the general aspect of the parish, in an
agricultural point of view, has undergone little or no change.  The
money brought into the parish by the fisheries is all required to
answer the demands of the landlords; and a better system of hus.
bandry and increased comfort to the labouring classes, cannot be
expected till the rents are reduced, and encouraging leases grant.
ed as in other places. -The undivided state of the common has
also proved a great obstacle to improvement.
