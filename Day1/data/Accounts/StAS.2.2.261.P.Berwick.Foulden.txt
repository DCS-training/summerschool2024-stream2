		PARISH OF FOULDEN.

PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE

     THE REV. ALEXANDER CHRISTISON, MINISTER.

        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THERE is a tradition that the parish of Foulden, or
Fulden, received its name from some foul transaction, of which it
was the scene during the border feuds. This origin of the name,
however, does not satisfy etymologists, of whom some hold that it
refers to the former marshiness, and others, to the fertility of the
parish.
   Extent Boundaries.-It is 2 miles and 2 furlongs in length, and
2 miles and 11/2 furlongs in breadth, and is of a compact form.
The northern conterminous parish is Ayton; the western, Chirn-
side; the southern, Hutton; and the eastern, Mordington. The
southern extremity is traced by the river Whitadder; which is here
remarkable for the depth of its bed, insomuch that its banks are
from 120 to 150 feet in height. The hither bank is often inter-
rupted by deep and wild ravines, some of which wind fully a mile
northward. Traversing the parish from south to north, one meets
first with a strong clay, then with a sandy loam, and lastly with-
cultivated moor.
   Climate.-As Foulden is highly cultivated in an agricultural point
of view, as plantations and a chain of heights shelter it from every
inclement blast, and as it slopes gently and continuously from its
northern to its southern extremity, its people ought to be very
healthy. Yet the former Statistical Account, founding, no doubt,
on inadequate data, gives a very exaggerated representation of the
salubrity of the parish. During my connection with it, malignant
small-pox, scarlet fever, and influenza have prevailed in it. In
the year 1827, eleven of its inhabitants died; and the average
yearly mortality since has been five.
		       II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Land-owners.-Four-fifths of the land is the property of John
Wilkie, Esq. of Foulden: the rest belongs to Geo. Baillie, Esq.
