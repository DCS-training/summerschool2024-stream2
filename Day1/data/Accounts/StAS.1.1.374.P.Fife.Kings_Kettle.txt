     Statistical Account

minister is Mr Peter Barclay, who was settled in May 1778.
He is married, and has four sons and one daughter.  The
church appears, by a date on it, to have been built in 1636.
It has been twice repaired since, and is in good condition.
The manse is at present in such bad order, that it is intended
to move for a new one in the spring.

   Poor.-There are at present about 14 persons who receive
alms constantly or occasionally, being almost all infirm old
people.  The collection for the poor has been, for the last 12
years, L. 16 per annum; and there is L. 300 out at interest
at 4 1/2 per cent.

   School.-The school and master's house are in good repair.
The master is rather too old for much activity; but he has
as assistant of considerable abilities.  The salary, with the
house and session-clerkship, is about L. 22 a year, beside the
school-dues, which are, for English, 1 s. 3 d.; writing, 1 s. 8 d.;
arithmetic, 2 s.; Latin, 2 s. 6 d.

   Price of Provisions and Labour.-From the vicinity to Edin-
burgh, and many coast towns, provisions are commonly kept
at the Edinburgh prices.  The grain is always lower than
the lowest Edinburgh or Lothian grain.  A day-labourer is
paid 10 d. a day, on an average; a carpenter or mason
1 s. 6 d.; a taylor 1 s.; but the common way of charging is
by the piece.  Labourers generally earn about 13 guineas a
year; and their wives, if industrious, about L. 7 or L. 8 by
spinnning, when not otherwise engaged.  The woman always
spin with both hands.  Domestic men-servants wages, at an
average, L. 6; female servants L. 2: 15: 0.
