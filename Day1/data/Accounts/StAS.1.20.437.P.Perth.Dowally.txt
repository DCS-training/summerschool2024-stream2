pose of such comparison, the following is given, stating the
increase of some trees in a plantation belonging to the Mar-
quis of Lansdown.  They were planted in 1765, and mea-
sured in 1786, at the height of 5 feet from the ground.

   The same objections lie against this Table as the two
former, and it has this in addition, that only one tree of
each species was measured.  In looking at Table I. and II.
remarkable differences may be observed betwixt the growth
of different individuals of the same species.  In this, ther-
fore, as in other cases, where it is wished to sound a gene-
ral conclusion, the induction of particular cases should be
extensive.  A thousand accidental circumstances may acce-
lerate or retard the growth of one tree, which may not oc-
cur to any other in the whole plantation; but if the mea-
surement is taken of many, the hurtful and the favourable
circumstances so counterbalance each other, as to produce a
fair average result, on which the planter may rely.
   The important general conclusion from these Tables is
that the planting of tiber-trees, if the proper species is
chosen, in a profitable mode of cropping ground, if not very
valuable for the plough.  It is one which accumulates
yearly in value, without an yearly outlay of expence, and
