     of Dalmeny.

   Surface and Air.-The parish lies high in the middle, de-
clines somewhat to the west, has a very considerable dectivity
to the south, and still more the north, where it terminates
with a bold bank upon the Forth.  Within it are three long
rocky and woody ridges, or rather little hills, Mons-hill,
Dundas-hill, and Craigie-hill; the prospects from which are 
both remarkably extensive and diversified.  The view from
Mons-hill, in particular, has been celebrated for its almost
unequalled compass and beauty.  Standing upon the top of
this ridge, you see the mountain of Ben-Lomond on the west;
the Ochil and Lomond hills to the north; North Berwick-
Law, the Bass, and Isle of May, to the east; Pentland and
Lammer-muir hills to the south.  Besides the Forth, and the
numerous towns, villages, seats, woody hills, and rising 
grounds, on each bank of it, the charming park of Barn-
bougle lies immediately under the eye, characterised for its
bold waving surface, composed of the finest heights and lawns,
and also for the variety, elegance, and fancy, of the rides 
within its circuit.  The prospect extends, in general, as far
as the eye can reach;  and sixteen counties, in whole or in
part, are said to be within the view.  Different travellers have
remarked, that this scenery is among the finest in Europe.
This may account for the salubrity of the air, for which the
parish has been noted; owing, perhaps, to its high situation,
and to its being guarded from the east and west winds by
the hills within its bounds.  The village of Dalmeny, which
lies delightfully situated, nearly in the line between Mons-
hill and Dundas-hill, is, from this circumstance, protected
from the north east and south-west winds; the former the
most baleful, and the latter the most violent, in this country.
The longevity of its inhabitants has been often remarked:
Mr. Nasmith, the late minister, who was 63 years in office
here, died at 91; Mrs. Nasmith near the same age; the school-
