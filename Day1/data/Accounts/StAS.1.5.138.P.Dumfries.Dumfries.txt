     Statistical Account

ly built, the town is open, and on the whole, well venti-
lated; and there is a sufficient descent to the river from al-
most every quarter.  The ground on which it stands is a
gravel or sand, and the Nith, with a good current, and of a
considerable wideness, runs pretty close to it.  It may be ex-
pected therefore, that the town and parish should be, as
they certainly are, abundantly healthy.  From their fa-
vourable southern exposure, and from being defended by
high lands, or mountain to the north, the town and neigh-
bouring country partake of that mild temperature of the
air, and often enjoy those mild winters, which in general
are observable from the Solway Frith, all along the coast
of Galloway.  The state of the weather in winter is, for
the most part, very different in this tract, from what it is
in places which lie 40 or 50 miles to the N. and E. of us.

   Diseases.-Consumptions and rheumatisms are frequent
here, as they are indeed in all variable climates, especially
when due pains are not taken to defend the body, by suit-
able clothing, against the bad effects of sudden changes of the
weather.

   The prevalence of the palsy, and of insanity, has, of late,
been particularly taken notice of amongst us.  Whether or
not they are really more frequent than they were 20 or 30
years ago, it would not be easy to determine.  The esta-
blishment of the Infirmary of this place, where patients have
been received for these 15 years past, has brought within
our knowledge and observation, a considerable number of
persons unhappily labouring unber both these disorders.  A
good part of them might not have been heard of here, if an
Infirmary had not been established.  The debilitating effects
of some cold and wet seasons, may, perhaps, have contribu-
ted to the Frequency of the palsy.  Some old people tell us,
(and there may be some truth in the observation,) that we
