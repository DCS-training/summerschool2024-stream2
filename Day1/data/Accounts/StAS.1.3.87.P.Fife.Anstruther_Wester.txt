to the Union with England.  It is evident, that event
did undoubtedly give a great shock to the trade of these
towns.  Their staple commodities were malt, herrings, and
cod.  Before the Union, there were 24 ships belonging to
Easter and Wester Anstruther, and 30 boats employed in
the fishery.  In 1764, there were only two ships, each 40
tons burden, and three fishing boats belonging to Anstru-
ther-Easter, and one of 20 tons, and two fishing boats to
Anstruther-Wester.  At present the number of ships be-

nage 1172, men employed 94, of which six in the foreign, 13
in the coasting, and one in the fishing trade; eight of those
belong to Anstruther-Wester, whose tonnage is 532, and
they employ 36 men.  At present there is not a single person
in the parish, who can properly come under the denomina-
tion of a fisherman; yet in the herring season there are four
boats, which are manned by the tradesmen of the place, and
some mariners, and fitted out for fishing.  Ever since the
battle of Kilfyth, the people here have a strong avertion to a

a single instance of a person insisting, and it was into the
train of artillery.  There has not been a suspicion of murder
for these 50 years.  A single instance of suicide is remem-
bered about the 1744.  No person has been tried before a
criminal court since the 1732, and he petitioned for banish-
ment.  This is the only instance even of banishment.

   Agriculture is much improved; the cattle employed are of
a better breed, and in finer order, and the tenants enjoy
more of the comforts of society, and are in a more affluent
state than their predecessors.  This change is probably owing
to the following causes:  Formerly the rent was all paid in 
victual, which the tenants were obliged to drive six Scots
