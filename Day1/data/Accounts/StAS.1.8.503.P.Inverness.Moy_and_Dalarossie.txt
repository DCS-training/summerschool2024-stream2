many gentlemen resort to it in the shooting season.  Cranes and
wild ducks nestle in the island in the lake of Moy.  On a
high rock, above the river Findhorn, an eagle has for many
years built her nest.

   Woods.-Where is a good deal of natural wood on the banks
of the river Findhorn, chiefly birch and alders.  There is a
tradition, that before this country came into the possession of
Mackintosh, it was in a great measure over-run with wood,
and called the Forest of Strathdearn; that it was set on fire
through carelessness, and destroyed by the inhabitants, when
they began to clear the ground for cultivation.-The Laird of
Mackintosh has very considerable plantations of Scotch firs
mixed with forest trees; to which he is making additions an-
nually.  These plantations are in a thriving way, and in a short
space of time, will decorate the country, and be of very great
service to the inhabitants.

   Rivers.-The river Findhorn takes its rise, in the hills of
this parish, from a few inconsiderable springs, the principal
one of which issues, in a copious stream, from what is called
the Cloven Stone, a large rock with a fissure in it.  The di-
rection of this river is nearly from S. W. to N. E.  After
running for the course of 24 miles through this parish, it
passes through those of Calder, Ardclach, Edenkeillie, Dyke
and Forres, and fails into the Murray Frith at Findhorn, in
the parish of Kinloss.  The whole course of it, from its source
to the sea, is about 50 miles.  It is called, in English, Find-
born, from the place at which it enters the sea; but the Gae-
lic name of it is Uifg-earn.  From thence this parish, through
which it runs for the space of 24 miles, is called Strathdearn.
As this river runs, for all this course, between high moun-
tains, and receives many streams or rivulets in its progress,
