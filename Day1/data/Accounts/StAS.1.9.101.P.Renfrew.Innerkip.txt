There are no tolls in the parish, and only one ferry across

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are 5 heritors, Sir
Michael Stewart, Baronet, of Blackhall, John Shaw
Stewart, Esq; of Greenock, Duncan Darroch, Esq; of
Gourock, John Wallace, Esg; of Kelly, and Duncan
Campbell, Esq; of Langhouse.  Besides there, there are
a great number of small feuars;-two heritors only reside.
Sir Michael Stewart, whose residence is Ardgowan, is pro-
prietor of the greatest part of the parish.  The house is de-

Sir Michael Stewart's estate, stands near the church, is di-

on Mr Darroch's estate.  From situation, this place is very

It employs at present 49 people, and manufactures about
165 tons of hemp yearly.  The walk is 200 fathoms long,
one half of which is covered with a slate roof.  On the
