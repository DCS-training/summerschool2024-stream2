two subscription Societies for the relief of the indigent or destitute
sick.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-This parish, like all the rest in the
county, has been hitherto exempt from the evils of legal assess-
ment.  The poor receive relief from the parochial funds at the dis-
posal of the kirk-session, from the revenue of an estate in the pa-
rish, which the Crown, as ultimus hares, vested in trustees for cha-
ritable purposes, and from another fund in the management of the
town-council.  The United Secession Congregation also afford
relief to their own poor.
   The average number of poor on the kirk-session's permanent roll
is 81 1/3, and the average rate of relief to each per annum is from
2s. to L.1, 10s.  Besides these, an average number of 32 1/3 receive
occasional relief, amounting to L.7, 0s. 3d. per annum, and from L.5
to L.7s, 10s. have been expended annually on the education of poor
children.  The funds under the administration of the kirk-session
arise from chureh-door collections averaging, L.39. 3s. 8d. per
annum; donations, and dues arising from marriages and burials.
   Prisons.-There is one prison connected with the town-house,
not of the best description; but a new one is in contemplation un-
der the late Prison Act.
   Inns.-Of these there are several, but one only adapted for the
accommodation of respectable travellers.
   Fairs.-There is one fair, commencing on the first Tuesday
after the 11th August, and continuing a fortnight.
   Fuel.-The principal fuel is English coal; but peats procured
in this and the adjacent parishes are much used by the poor.
