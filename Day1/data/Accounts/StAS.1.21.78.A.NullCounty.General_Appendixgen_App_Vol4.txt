for the poor, and having been very importunate with one of
them on some such occasion, received for answer a box on the
ear, on which he only remarked, 'Voila, pour moi et mes
'pauvres!' Of the herrings of Loch-Dowalton, I fear, I
may say, So much for me and my poor!  Unfortunately,
they can never still the bellies of the poor; though they have
been used by some of the rich as anchovies to make their wine
relish.
   There are besides, Sir, some other mistakes in the account
of Kirkinner, which I think must hake arisen from changing
my words, and misapprehending my meaning, though none of
them of so signally absurd an aspect as the former.
   In just the next sentence to the account of Loch-Dowalton,
it is said, 'The extent of waste ground along the frith of
'Cree is about 3 miles.'  In my jottings I find the words

not wish to convey to the public any false, or even any in-
distinct idea, as far as my understanding served me.

they have always put Baldern.  In page 138 of vol. 4th, for
'course land of Baldern,' read ' carse land of Baldoon,' 6th line
from the bottom of the page.  Wherever Baldern occurs,
read Baldoon.
   Page 144, in the middle, I find the words, 'the glebe
'about 9 acres of very bad foil;'in place of which, the words
