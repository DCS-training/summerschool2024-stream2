     Statistical Account

Banff has about 3 l/2 English miles of the river, and Colonel
Duff only one.  The fish, however, are small, and the fish-
ings inconsiderable.  It is only when there happens a
high water on Sunday, when the cruives are open, that
there is a chance of a run.  At other times, the fishings

   There are three mills in the parish:  Mill of Ribra,
Lord Banff's; and Mill of Burn-end and Mill of Car-

   Rent, Stipend, and Accommodations.-The valued rent of

had his barn, kiln, stable, and byre renewed; and is
getting the wings of the manse repaired, with the addi-

house being small.-The glebe is good land, but is only a

nister had a den adjoining to the glebe, and a small field
on the banks of Diveron, annexed in 1751, by decreet of
the presbytery, to make the pasture sufficient.  He has
presently no accommodation of moss; the moss on which
he had a locality being exhausted, and no new one yet
settled for him.  There is indeed but little moss in the
parish.

   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the
population in 1755 was 607.  The list of parishioners
varies from accidental causes, by the residence or non-
residence of the heritors and their families.  The popula-
tion has increased of late, by the division of some tacks
and subsets on a large farm.  In 1782, the number of
