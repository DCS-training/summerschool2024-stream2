Jarvie.  The next is Loch-Lichart, in a line to the west, four
miles long, where there is plenty of trout, some weighing
four and five pounds.  The loch is lined on both fides with
a ridge of high hills, covered with oak and birch wood, with
some firs, interspersed here and there with green spots for
shealing, and at both ends, on each side, pretty extensive
flats of corn land.  The oak wood on this loch-side sold
three years ago for 360 l.  Betwixt Loch-Lichart and Loch-
Bran, on the same water, are several inconsiderable lakes, all
abounding with black and white trout; and Loch-Bran a-
bounds with large pike.  Several miles to the west of that is
Loch-Chrosk, abounding with trout.  To the north-west of
Loch-Lichart, four miles distance, lies Loch-Fannich, abound-
ing with fish, is six Scotch miles in length; from it issues a
small river, called Grudie, which discharges itself into the
Cannon, about one mile above Loch Lichart.-All the straths
are liable to inundations.  The most remarkable ones hap-
pened in March 1789; and this very year, (1791) the great-
est part of the corn lands were twice overflowed this harvest
in the course of 20 days, by which the crop was much da-
maged.-There is a very remarkable echo on the farm of
Kinellan; it will echo a whole sentence perfectly distinct.
It is believed to be unequalled, unless by an echo in Wales,
and another in Staffa, the latter of which is of a very diffe-
rent nature.

cattle, horses, sheep, goats, deer, roe, foxes, wild cats, pole-
cats, badgers, and otters.-Common fowls of various kinds;
