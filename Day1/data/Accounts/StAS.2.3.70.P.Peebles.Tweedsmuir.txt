  Inns.-There are three of these in the parish, but being situ-
ated  on the turnpike road, they may be considered necessary for
the accommodation of travelelrs.   At the same time  they are, to
a certain extent, demoralizing in their influence, especially on the
habits of those who live in their vicinity.   From the responsibility
attached to the office of shepherds in this district, where they are
entrusted with almost the whole managementm men of truly up-
right characters have been generally selected, and it certainly
speaks volumes in favour of their principles, that few  of them  are
at all injuriosly affected by the temptations which the contiguity
of taverns seldom fails  to present.
   Fuel.-Coal of good quality cannot be procured nearer than
Douglas, twenty-six miles distant, and of course it is an expensive
fuel.  But excellent peat abounds in the parish, which is of im-
mense value, as respects the comfort of the poor.  Such was the
wetness of the summer 1830, that it was scarcely procurable, and
coals were used in most houses during the following winter; and
persons upwards of seventy years of age had recourse to this kind
of fuel who had never seen it in their houses before.
