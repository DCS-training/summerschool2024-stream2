priviliges, liberties, and immunities, possessed by the town
of Inverness.  The town is one of the five boroughs, con-

   The Antient Size of the Town.-There are some circum-
stances which would seem to indicate, that the town was
once much more extensive than it is now.  The cross now
stands at the east end of this borough; but a street of about
200 yards long runs from it to the north east; and a gentle-

shore, had on three sides an extensive plain.  It was situated
at a considerable distance from any rising ground, and a little
river with a deep slimy channel, into which the sea flowed,

which still remains, has the stones to strongly cemented with
the mortar that it is easier to break a solid rock, than to se-
perate those of which it is composed.  To the north east,
but contigouous to the castle, there is an area of about half an-
