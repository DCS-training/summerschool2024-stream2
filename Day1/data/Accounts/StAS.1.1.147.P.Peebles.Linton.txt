called Harlaimuir, probably from some skirmish, of which
there is no tradition.  Near Spittlehaugh is a park called
Chapelhill;  there are no remains nor tradition of a building;

parts of the parish.  A Roman urn was found in a cairn at
Garwaldfoot, by the late General John Douglas.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The village of Linton seems
adapted for a woollen manufacture of coarse goods.  The
Lyne would drive considerable weighty machinery.  Lime is
abundant; coal is not dear; and every house in the village
has a privilege of cutting peat ad libitum from the common
mosses, which, all expences included, may be put into the 
winter stack at 8 d. the single horse cart.
