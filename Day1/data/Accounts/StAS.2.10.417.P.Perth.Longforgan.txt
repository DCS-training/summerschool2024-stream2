      raised in the parish, it is obvious that any estimate we can form
      will be only an approximation to the truth.  But the followings view
      of it, from the principles on which the calculation has been made,
      is  perhaps as correct a one as can be exhibited.

         Manufactures.-The goods manufactured in the parish consist
      principally of Hessian sheeting, and brown tow sheeting and, sack-
      ing, intended to meet the demand of the home market, as well as
      for exportation to America.  Some plain linen and tweeled sheet-
      ings are also made for family use, though not by any means to a
      large extent. The value of the whole may amount to L. 310 per
      week.  In these different branches, about 150 weavers are em-
      ployed, of whom 70 are men, and 80 women, the wagdr of the
      former averaging l0s., and those of the latter 9s. each, per week.
      Perhaps 50 women and young persons are engaged in winding and
      otherwise preparing the yarns for the loom, whose weekly earnings
      may be nearly 3s. each.
        The " Carse of Gowrie Agricultural Society," which was insti-
      tuted in 1820, to promote improvements in agriculture, and en-
      courage the breeding and rearing of stock, held its regular meet-
      ings in spring and autumn at Longforgan.  It no longer exist,
      however, as a separate establishment, having lately been incorpo-
      rated with the " Perthshire Agricultural Association," formed for
      similar purposes.

          Market-Town and Villages.-There is no market-town in the
      parish, but its inhabitants are favourably situated in that respect,
      from their vicinity to Dundee (about three miles distant from its
      eastern extremity,) where there is an admirable supply of both
      butcher-meat and fish in its season, where all the necessaries and
      comforts of life can be obtained on the most reasonable terms, and
