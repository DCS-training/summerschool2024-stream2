gant plan; the semicircular groves of trees, and the fertile
fields, and windings of the river Liddal, contribute their
various beauties to delight the eye.

   Mountains.-The principal mountains are Tudhope,
Millenwood-fell, Windhead, Greatmoor, Dun, Dod, Her-
mitage, Peel-fell, Roan-fell, Lariston-fell, Carby-Laws,
and Tinnis hills.  The last mentioned is seen as a land mark
at a great distance out at sea.  None of these mountains have
been measured by the barometer.  But when Mr Stobie
surveyed the county, he measured those of the Cheviot,
Cartawisp, etc. and when on the top of the highest in this
parish, he compared them with others by the Theodohte;
by this it appears Tudhope is 1830 feet above the level of
the sea.  Millenwood-fell and Windhead are about 2000
feet.  These are the highest of them.

   Rivers and Fish.-The rivers are the Liddal, the Hermi-

kingdoms), the Tinnis and the Blackburn; with several
other streams of inferior note.  All of them are plentifully
stored with trouts, and afford excellent sport to the angler.

   Climate and Longevity.-The climate is very damp,
owing to two causes.  From us proximity to the Atlantic
Ocean, a great collection of vapour arises which is attracted
by the mountains, and poured down in torrents of rain.
The other is owing to the nature of the soil and surface of
the hills themselves.  They are generally covered to the
very summit with a deep stratum of moss, which retains
the moisture; under the moss lies a bed of till, through
which the water cannot easily penetrate.  Notwithstanding
the dampness of the air, those who are bred in the country
enjoy good health, and many of them have arrived at a
