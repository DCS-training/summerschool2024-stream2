chapel; and there are besides, 3 Independents and 1 Baptist.
No other Dissenters are known.
   The number of families worshipping at the parish church is
244, and Divine service is remarkably well attended.  The num-
ber of communicants for some years has been about 700.  Col-
lections are annually made for the Aberdeen Infirmary, Pauper
Lunatic Fund of the Presbytery of Alford, and the General As-
sembly's schemes, to the amount of L.12 to L. 14.
   Education.-The parish is well supplied with the means of edu-
cation. There are five schools, two parochial, one in connection
with the General Assembly's Education scheme, and two endow-
ed.  Each of the parochial teachers has the minimum salary,
and legal accommodations of house and garden, with an allowance
from the Dick bequest of about L. 30, and the fees may average
from L. 12 to L. 15.  The school situated near the old manse of
Leochel, with a comfortable school-house, was built by Sir Charles
Forbes, Bart. of New and Edinglassie, who, for several years, al-
lowed to the teacher a salary of L.20.  The salary was withdrawn
in 1837, but the late Charles and Peter Ritchie, in Wester Leochel,
have since bequeathed L. 300, the interest of which is to be given
to the teacher of this school, and another benevolent person con-
templates a bequest of L. 200 for the same purpose.  Sir John
Forbes allows him a garden, and the fees may average from L. 10
to L. 12.  Another school is situated in the eastern district of the
parish, and was endowed by the late Peter M'Combie, Esq. of
Lenturk.  The emoluments of the teacher are, a commodious
house, garden, half-an acre of land, and a salary of L. 20.  The
fees may yield from L. 10 to L. 12 annually.
   Libraries.-There are two small parochial libraries, one be-
longing to each of the old parishes, and consisting chiefly of reli-
gious works.
