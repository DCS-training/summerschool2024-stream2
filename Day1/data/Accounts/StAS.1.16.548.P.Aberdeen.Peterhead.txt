     Statistical Account

The rent of the salmon-fishing is L. 100 Sterling; and the
number of barrels caught annually is at an average from
50 to 60; a few, for some years, have been pickled for
the London market, owing to the tacksmen, who reside in
Peterhead, having very extensive connections with that
branch of trade elsewhere.  Fresh salmon are sold at 2 1/2 d.
per pound, formerly at 2 d.  There can, however, be no

the country.  There are no pikes nor shell-fish in the river,
except the pearl muscle, in which pearls of value are some-
times found.

   Loch of Mayreside.-I have said there are no lakes in this
parish.  In winter, however, a small loch is formed in one
part of the parish, a considerable extent of ground being
overflowed from the particular situation of the adjacent
fields, and the ditches not being kept in proper order to
carry off the stagnate water, called the Loch of Myreside,
where persons fond of skating sometimes find amusement,
when it is frozen over with ice, and where wild ducks,
wild geese, and sometimes swans resort in winter.  The
lands overflowed by the water are meliorated in the soil,
and would be more fertile if the ditches were kept in pro-
per order.

   Sea-Fish.-There is great variety of fish caught in this
parish on the coast, and of an excellent quality, such as had-
docks, whitings, flounders of all kinds, roughback, plaise,
sole, halibut, turbot, skate, dog and cat fish.  The lobster
and crab, and other species of cancer, are common; the
lobsters formerly were more frequent, and purchased in
great quantities for the London market; there are at pre-
sent not above 4000 annually sent from this parish.  The
