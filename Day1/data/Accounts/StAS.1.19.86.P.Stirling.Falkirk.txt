thorised to say, that there have not been sold in the sham-
bles of this town, during the course of the last year, fewer
than 2000 black cattle, 6000 sheep and lambs, and calves

habit of eating butcher-meat, except a little with their
greens in winter.  This scanty portion they salted about
Martinmas, and consequently, about that season of the year,
