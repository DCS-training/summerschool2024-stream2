of Roskeen, had the architect reported in regard to Kirkintilloch
church, that, in consequence of raising the level of the floor, which
was required there as in Roskeen case, it would be necessary to
heighten the walls, in order to afford proper accommodation to the
sitters. The architect, however, had omitted all notice of this
matter in his report; and when the chargers, on the cause com-
ing into the Inner-House, proposed to put additional queries to
him to bring out the facts as to this matter, the Court held them
foreclosed, by their not having previously objected to the report,
and refused to allow additional queries to be put. It was on this
point that the case for the Presbytery was lost; and the church,
accordingly, remains in its present ruinous condition.* It contains
about 800 sittings, and is generally crowded every Sabbath. The
regular communicants average 700. No free sittings, and only
a very few pay for their seats. The glebe amounts to 8 acres,
including the garden. About 6 acres of the glebe were lately let
for L. 14, 1Os. per annum.

   The new church of St David's, upon the Assembly's Church
Extension plan, was erected in 1837. It is fitted to contain 1012
