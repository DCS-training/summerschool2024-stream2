                           HAWICK.                          391

   A History of Hawick, to which we have been indebted for a few
facts embodied in this Account, was published in 1825 by the late
Mr Robert Wilson, a native of the town.
   Land-owners.--Thechiefland-owners in the parish are, His Grace
the Duke of Buccleuch; Benjamin T. G. Anderson, Esq. of Tushie-
law; William Turnbull, Esq. of Fenwick; Allan R Lockhart,
Esq. of Borthwickbrae; James Douglas, Esq. of Cavers; James
Dickson, Esq. of Alton; James Oliver, Esq. of Burnflat; James
Dickson, Esq. of Housebyres; and the Town of Hawick.  The
Duke of Buccleuch is proprietor of nearly nine-tenths of the parish.
   Parochial Registers.-- The register of births commences in 1634,
and is continued to the present time, with the exception of two in-
tervals, the one occurring between 1657 and 1669, And the other
between 1750 and 1756.
   The register of marriages is defective in sevdrel places, but is
complete from 1699 to 1730, from 1751 to 1800, and from 1834
to the present time.
   The register of deaths was begun in 1755, and has been regu-
larlv kept ever since.
   The register of money transactions commences in 1724, and
has been carried down without interruption till now.
   The records of the kirk-session ate very defective.  From 1700
to 1704, from 1751 to 1768, and from 1786 to 1798 the entries
have been made with considerable regularity, but with these ex-
ceptions, and a few isolated fragments, there has been no continu-
ous record till recently.
   In looking into these parochial registers one or two points pre-
sent themselves to notice, which it may not be superfluous to re-
cord.
   1st.  Collections were repeatedly made, about the beginning of,
last century, for the erection of churches in the north, and in other
places destitute of the means and opportunities of religious wor_
ship, which shows that the extension of the church, even in those
days, was not regarded as a matter of indifference.
   2d. Considerable sums were expended by the kirk-session in the
support of probationers recommended by the General Assembly,
and also in the education of young men for the ministry, there be,
ing at least six bursars connected with the parish between 1725
and 1740, from which we infer that active measures were adopted,
not merely for the erection of places of worship, but for too rear-
ing of an ample and efficient ministry.
