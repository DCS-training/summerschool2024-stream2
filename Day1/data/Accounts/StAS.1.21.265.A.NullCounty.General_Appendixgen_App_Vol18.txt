leave his load, telling him, if King James was King of Scot-
land, he was King of Kippen, so that it was reasonable he
should share with his neighbour King, in some of these load
so frequently carried that road.  The carrier represented this
usage, and telling the story, as Arnpryor spoke it, to some
of the King's servants, it came at length to his Majesty's
ears, who soon afterwards, with a few attendants, came to
visit his neighbour King, who happened to be at din-
ner.  King James having sent a servant to demand access,
was denied the same by a tall fellow, with a battle-ax, who
stood porter at the gate, telling there could be no access till
dinner was over.  This answer not satisfying the King, he
sent to demand access a second time; upon which he was de-
sired by porter to desist, otherwise he would find cause to
repent his rudeness.  His Majesty finding this method would
not do, desired the porter to tell his master, that the goodman
of Ballageich* desired to speak with the King of Kippen.
The porter telling Arnpryor so much, he in all humble man-
her came and received the King, and having entertained
him with much sumptuousness and jollity, became so agree-
able to King James, that he allowed him to take as much of
any provision he found carrying that road, as he had occasion
for; and seeing he made the first visit, desired Arnpryor in
a few days to return him a second at Stirling, which he per-
formed, and continued in very much favour with the King,
always thereafter being termed King of Kippen while he
lived.
