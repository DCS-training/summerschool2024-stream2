There are in all about 47 heritors in the parish, yielding a va-
luation of L. 4725, 6s. 6d. Scots money. The real valuation is
about L. 5000.  The heritors are mostly resident. The princi-
pal properties are, Pollock, Southfield, Caplerig, Greenbank,
Fingleton, Netherhouse, &c. Many of the richer heritors have
excellent modern mansion-houses. The principal proprietor is
Sir R. C. Pollock, Bart. Upper Pollock is the chief messuage
of that barony. The house stands on a rising-ground, with a good
exposure, and commanding an extensive view of the country
around. His family are said to be descended from Peter, the son
of Falbert, who lived in the time of Malcolm IV., and is mentioned
in ancient records as an early donator to the monastery of Pais-
ley. In former times, a chapel stood at Upper Pollock, which
disappeared after the Reformation.  Southfield is a very pleasant
residence, and is well sheltered with wood and plantations. This
property was purchased by Mr Urie in 1680 from the Stewarts of
Blackhall, afterwards by Mr Gilchrist in 1750, and by Alexander
Hutchison, Esq. of Jamaica in 1771. It is now the property of
Mr Cunningham. The Kirk rivulet rises a little to the west of
this. Caplerig was an ancient seat of the Knights Templars ; it
now belongs to a family of the name of Brown, An ancient square
tower is still pointed out, which passes under the name of the Old
Castle of Mearns. This was formerly the chief seat of the Max-
wells. It has lately been roofed in, and is surmounted with a flag-
staff. The roof is so contrived, that, being invisible from without,
it does not in the least disfigure the building. On a late occasion,
the ancient echoes of this antique warlike fortalice were awaked
after a sleep of centuries to the voice of music, and the nimble
cadences of the "light fantastic toe."
