mensal churches belonging to the Bishop of Ross.  The Bishop
was patron, and had what remained of the tiends, after the
share allowed by him to the person employed to perform the
duties of the pastoral office.  At the revolution the King be-
came patron, and the Earl of Cromarty obtained from Queen
Anne a gift of the patronage, which has now devolved upon Mrs
Urquhart of New-hall.-The church was built in 1756, and the
manse in 1707-By a decreet of locality anno 1708, the stipend was
modified at nine chalders, payable equally in bear and oat meal,
with the vicarage or small tithes.-There was a new decreet anno
1781, by which no alteration was made in the victual, but
300 merks Scotch, of money stipend were appointed, and the
vicarage tithes made over to the heritors.  The living at the
ordinary conversion may be estimated at L. 90 sterling, includ-

tiends, there is a large fund for an augmentation.  The estate

tained from King William by the first Earl of Cromarty, which
is now run out.
   There is a parochial school near the church, and a conveni-
ent house lately built for teacher and scholars.  The salary
is L. 5 sterling in money from the heritors, and 8 bolls of bar-
ley from the farmers, and this with the other emoluments
may be estimated at L. 16 per annum.- There are no dissenters
in the parish, except three families who have lately come from
a part of the country in which a seceding meeting house is
established; but they occasionally attend the established
church.-Gaelic being the common language of the people,
the greater part of religious service on Sundays is performed in
that language.  Many of the inhabitants are taught to read
