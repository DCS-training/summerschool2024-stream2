convenience, than that when a great quantity is threshed out
at once, the straw is less relished by the cattle, than when
it is fresh from the slail.
   Kilns, with heads made of cast-iron, in which twelve bolls
of oats can be dried in the course of 6 hours, have been built
last year, by the chief heritors.  Care must be taken not to
over-heat them, and to turn the grain often, as in some in-
stances where these precautions were neglected, the whole

   The farmer justly complains of the heavy tax, which bears
the name of multure.  It is indeed a real oppression, when
many of the farms are bound to pay the miller the eleventh
peck of meal, and in some cases, a similar quantity of beans,
and barley.  The tenants of Leckie are now free from this

arable land is assessed at the rate of one shilling sterling per
acre for defraying every necessary expence, to which the
tenants have chearfully submitted.
   It would be of great benefit to the country, if all that va-

the obligation to which the tenants are subjected; to pay
fowls, to drive coals, peats and dung; and in harvest, to
cut down the proprietor's grain.  By being thus in a state of
requisition, the tenant is often incapable of attending to his
own affairs.  On some very important occasions, the opportu-

   There is an established market in Stirling, for all sorts of
grain, to which the neighbouring farmers resort; and they
find a ready sale.  The price is usually regulated by the
Edinburgh and Haddington markets.
   The whole secret of farming, seems to ly in preserving the
land dry and clean, in observing a regular rotation of crops,
