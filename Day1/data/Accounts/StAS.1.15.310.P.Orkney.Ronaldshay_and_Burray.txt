stuff:  There are four blacksmiths, and 6 or 7 coblers.  But
the employers of the former tour furnish iron and coals,
and of the latter, hemp and leather.  There are in these pa-
rishes 2 indifferent, and 2 tolerably good inns; the houses for
selling ale and spirits are by far too numerous.  There are
also one good square wright, and 3 or four of inferior skill:
There are 2 fidlers, and one piper, who professes by means
of his music, to banish the rats from their habitations.  Their
is one notary public, who has property in South Ronaldsay,
and occasionaly resides in it.  Corbies, crows, and often
eagles, are found in these parishes: They often do con-
siderable damage to the corn, lambs, and poultry.  Gulls,
scarfs, kitty-weaks, rock-pidgeons, plovers, snipes, solon
geese, larks, rails, and ducks of all kinds, abound.  There are
no hares or foxes to be found, and it is said they cannot live
in Orkney.  There is no instance remembered of a dog being
mad:  Muir fowl are numerous in many isles of this coun-
try, but for want of heath, few or none can be found in these
parishes.

   Fishes.-Cod, ling, skate, turbet, haddocks, sillocks, quiths
or cuddens, lobsters, cockles, are found around these isles in
such abundance, that almost every person supplies himself,
and few or none are sold.  The price offered by the purcha-
ser is not a sufficient compensation for the labour and ex-
pence of the fisher.  On account of the high duties on salt,
very few indeed are cured for market.  Consequently those
who do not fish or have no share of a boat, are at all times
ill supplied, and in stormy weather, even those who do fish,
must rest satisfied with the sour fish, which are dried by the
sun and air, or by the smoke and fire in their houses.  In
July and August, shoals of herrings, numerous as the sand
on the sea shore, are seen around these parishes; but for want
of nets salt, etc. none are caught or cured here.
