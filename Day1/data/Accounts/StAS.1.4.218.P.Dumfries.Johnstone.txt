   Population, etc.-From what can be learned, this part of
Annandale was once more populous than at present.  The
decrease is owing to several farms being united, and good
arable land turned solely into pasture, on the largest estate
of the parish.  Of late, however, the farms there have been
divided and subdivided, and the good effects of this judi-
cious plan are beginning to appear.  Land which from ne-

subdivision of farms has enlarged the number of families,
and the cultivation of the land now going briskly on, has

to Dr Webster, about 40 years ago, was 494.  The num-
