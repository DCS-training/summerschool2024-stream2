     of Cromdale.

the people manage their farms with the help of their children.
The high wages of men servants we attribute to the floating
of wood, which finds business for all our men, from 16 to 60
years of age, who, during the warm season, receive from 1 s. to
1 s. 2 d. for each days labour.  Fuel is every where to be had,
on easy terms, and of the belt quality, through the whole of
this country.

   Taverns.-Many public houses, by the general resolution of
the counties concerned, have of late been suppressed; and
there are at present only 4, besides those mentioned in Gran-
town.  Two of there are on the turnpike road, for the accom-
modation of travellers.

   Antiquities.-The only antiquity in the parish, is the For-
talix at Lochindorb, where a thick wall of mason work, (20
feet high even at this period, and supposed to have been
much higher,) surrounds an acre of land within the Loch, with
watch towers at every corner, all entire.  The entrance to
this place, is at a gate built of freestone, which has a gran-
deur in it, that is easier felt than expressed.  Several vestiges
of houses are found within the walls, besides those of a church,
which, without difficulty, can still be traced in the ruins.
Great rafts, or planks of oak, by the beating of the waters
against the old walls, occasionally make their appearance; which
confirms an opinion entertained of this place, that it had been
a national business, originally built upon an artificial island.
Tradition says, and some credit is due to the report, that the
particular account of this building was lost in the days of
King Edward I. of England.

   Character of the People.-They are very industrious, oblig-
ing, and remarkable for nothing so much as neatness of dress
