grounds as can be got ploughed, is also cropped with oats.
The consequence of this treatment is, that the fields are
scourged and over-run with weeds, and the farmer for his
labour has often but a poor return.  Within these few years,
however, some of the more opulent of the farmers have 
begun to adopt a different plan, both with their infield and
outfield lands.  They have levelled, straighted, and cleaned
part of their infields, and after liming and a turnip crop,
have laid them out in grasses with a crop of barley.  The
turnips have been found to answer remarkably well; the
barley crops have been plentiful, and the grain of excellent
quality; and the hay crops not at all despicable.  A few
of the farmers have also limed some of their outfields, and
laid them out in grasses.  This they have also found greatly
to improve their pasture.  Scarce any of the infields have
as yet been broken up after this treatment; but there can-
not be a doubt, that they will turn out far more productive
than they formerly were; and it is to be hoped, that the
success with which the experiments already made have been
attended, will encourage those who have made them to
go on, enlarge their plans, induce others to follow
their example.  Although luxuriant crops cannot be ex-
pected from the mode of cultivation above mentioned, most
generally in use, yet there is more grain raised in the pa-
rish than is necessary for the maintenace of the inhabitants;
and the farmers send annually to the Aberdeen market a
considerable quantity of meal and some barley.  There are
besides, several other articles of provision, such as butter,
cheese, ducks, hens, eggs, etc. carried to the same market;
and by it the prices of all these different articles are gene-
rally regulated in the parish.
