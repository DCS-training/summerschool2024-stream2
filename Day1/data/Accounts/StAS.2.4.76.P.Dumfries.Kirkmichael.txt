pulation in that quarter is small, and there is access to a side-school
in the neighbouning parish of Closeburn.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The average number of persons
receiving parochial aid is 20, and the average sum allotted to
each per year is L. 1, 4s. There are no legacies or mortifications.
The annual amount of church collections, with small fines exacted
from delinquents, and other dues, is about L. 35, 3s. 10 1/2d. Se-
veral persons, not on the poors' roll, obtain. occasional relief. It is
still with reluctance that the necessitous are induced to apply for
parochial assistance. But it is easy to perceive that the spirit of
independence by which the lower classes in this country have been
so long distinguished, is here, as in other places, exhibiting symp-
toms of decay.
	It may be remarked, in concluding, that the rental of the parish,
when the former Statistical Account was drawn up, was L. 2500,
and that at present it amounts to L. 6475 per annum.
