Scotch; the real rent is nearly 700 L.  The average rent of
the arable land may be from 10 s. to 12 s. per acre; and the
remainder of heath and pasture, from 1 s. to 2 s. per acre.

   Church, Poor, and School.-The value of the living is about
70 L., with a small glebe.  The Earl of Glasgow is patron.
The church was built in the 1612, and is now too small to
accommodate the inhabitants.  The manse was built about
26 years ago, and is in good repair.  There are few poor up-
on the session list.  The collections made at the church door,
amounting to about 16 L., with the interest of a small fund,
is nearly equal to their support.  English, writing, and arith-
metic, are carefully taught, and the school is pretty well at-
tended; but the schoolmaster's salary and perquisites are very
trifling.

   Natural Curiosities.-There are two rocks, called Reppel
Walls, on the E. side of the island.  They rise out of the ele-
vated ground, and run along, or rather across, a plain near
the sea, in the direction of S. by E., and N. by W., distant
from each other 500 feet, running in parallel lines; the one
to the E. about 30 feet in height, 89 in length, mean thick-
ness 10 feet; that to the W. 200 feet long, 70 feet high,
where it comes out of the hill, and 60 feet near its outer
end; the thickness 12 feet.  In the same direction, there is
the appearance of a foundation running into the sea.  Some-
thing similar to these are seen in the opposite side of the island.

which proved instantly fatal.  The arms of this family are upon the end of the
kirk, and were lately to be seen on a part of the ruins of Billikellet.  About a
quarter of a mile from Billikellet, there is a large stone set up on end.  About 6
feet of it is above the ground.  It appears to have been the rude monument of
some ancient hero.  There is is also a place which the inhabitants point out, as
having been Danish camp, though no vestiges of it now remain.
