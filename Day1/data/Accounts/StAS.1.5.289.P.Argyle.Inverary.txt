near the castle of Inveraray, are of a deep rich soil, and
excellent arable land, yet a very considerable part is shal-
low and not naturally fertile; though that part which lies
within the Duke of Argyle's domain, has been considera-
bly meliorated by cultivation, particularly by the vast
quantities of lime annually laid upon it; a species of ma-
nure well adapted to most lands of this country, but from
the use of which, all, except the rich and affluent, are al-
most totally precluded, by the dearness of coals, and the
scarcity of other fuel necessary to burn it.  The inhabitants
are satified, if they can make as many peats as will barely

tremeties for want of fuel.  The heavy duty, laid on
coals carried coastwise, appears to be as unreasonable as it
is impolitic, and is universally complained of, as an into-

the officers employed in collecting it.  There was a plan in
agitation, a few years ago, for having this grievance re-
moved by means of a fair commutation, but the project
seems to have been relinquished; though it were to be hoped,
that whatever difficulties have formerly occurred, they
may yet be overcome.  A change of the laws in that re-

improvement in agriculture, and of every establishment in
manufacture.  Coals at Inveraray are seldom bought under

partly owing, to the high hills and woods, with which it is
surrounded.  It has been remarked that after a good fish-
