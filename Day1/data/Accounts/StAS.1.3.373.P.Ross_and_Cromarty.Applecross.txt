good, is thought richer than at any after period.  Cod and
ling are caught on different parts of the coast.  The cod is
in its best seaton from the middle of February to the end of
March; but ling is caught from the middle of March to the
end of July; yet those fished for the first two months are
reckoned the best.  Our rivers, though small, are very rapid;
they abound with trout, and those of Firdon and the river of
Applecross, produce some salmon.  Fishing is a favourite oc-
cupation of the people of this parish; they derive much of
their sustenance from the sea.  Each principal farmer bath
generally a boat of his own; and among the lower class,
either two, three, or four, make a joint purchase, according
as their circumstances will permit.  There are besides five
vessels, of from 20 to 40 tons, employed in the fishing, one
of which belongs to a fishing company, founded at a consi-
derable expence, by Mr M'Kenzie of Firdon, one of the he-
ritors of this parish.  The patriotic exertions of this gentle-
man merit much praise; and as such an establishment, by af-
fording a ready market, and an example for improvement to
our fishers, doth naturally quicken and improve their indus-
try, the public is interested in its success.

   Exports and Imports.-Black cattle, butter, cheese, fish and
kelp, are the exports of this parish.   All these articles, with-
in the last 30 years, have nearly doubled their value.  The
number of cattle annually sold may amount to 300, which,
of late years, at an average, draw about 21.15s.  The price 
of fish varies according to the quantity caught.  Herring,
packed for home consumption, give from 11 s.  to 15 s. the
barrel; but, if repacked for exportation, 4 of these barrels
go to make up 3.  Cod and ling are sold, either by the dozen,
or by the ton; when by the dozen, the price depends on
the size of the fish; if by the ton, it fetches from 12 L. to
