also provided with the legal accommodation. The probable yearly
amount of shool fees is about L. 20.
  There are four Sabbath schools in the parish in connexion with
the parish church; three of which are in the country, and one in
the town, consisting of nearly 300 scholars in all. There is a
small library of religious books for the use of the scholars.
  Literature.--There are two public libraries in the town.
  Charitable Institutions--Friendly Societies.--There are three
friendly societies in the parish, which seem to have done great good,
not only in affording relief to the needy, but in cherishing a spirit
of independence among the working-classes.
   The following table will give a view of their nature and operation.

                                                                2s. 6d. when on foot.
   Each member pays 1d. a week for each person claiming relief,
besides 3d. a quarter. From L. 1 to L. 5 is allowed for funeral
expenses, on the death of a member, besides a small allowance per
quarter to his widow.
   Savings Bank.--There is a savings bank in the town, patro-
nized by the Marquis of Bute; and which is under the direc-
tion of the heritors and minister of Old Cumnock, the ministers
of New Cumnock and Auchinleck; and of which the parish school-
master of Old Cumnock is treasurer. It was instituted in 1831,
and receires deposits from the parishioners of New Cumnock and
Auchinleck, as well as of Old Cumnock. It owed its prosperity
chiefly to the devoted attention of Mr Campbell, the treasurer.
    The stock on first January 1836 amounted to L. 810; depo-
sits from that date till 2d January 1837, were L. 421, 9s. 4 1/2d.;
the sums drawn out during that period, L. 251, 9s. 4 1/2d.; accu-
mulated stock on the 2d January 1837, L. 980.
   The number of depositors during the year was 223; and they
consist, for the most part, of male and female servants, though
there is also a number of trades people among them. This insti-
tution is likely to prove of incalculable advantage to the working
classes.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.--The average number on the poor's
roll is about 30, being about one pauper for every ninety-two
individuals in the parish. The sum allowed to each per month
