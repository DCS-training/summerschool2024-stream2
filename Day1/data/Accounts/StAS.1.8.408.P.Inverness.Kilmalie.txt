Yet they seldom give themselves the trouble to trace the ori-
gin of the expression.  As to the time, wherein this Malie
flourished, tradition is silent.

   Situation and Extent.-A part of the parish lies in Argyll-
shire, but the greatest part of it is in the county of Inverness.
Being intersected in three different places, by as many arms of
the sea, the parish is of an irregular form.  The length, from
N. W. to S. E., is about 60 miles in a straight line.  The
greatest breadth, from N. E. to S. W., is 30 miles in a line.
It comprehends about 589 square miles, or nearly 376,960
English acres, measuring in straight lines.  And, adding the
surface of the hills and rallies, it must be, at least, one third

   Surface, Soil, and Climate.-The greatest part of the parish con-

it is well calculated for sheep.  There are, however, many val-

rivers Lochy and Nevis, and in several other places, there is
a good deal of arable ground, of different qualities:  the soil,
in general, is shallow and sandy.  The climate cannot be rec-
koned unwholesome, for several have lived to an advanced
age; yet the air is moist, for the wind blows off the sea near-
ly two-thirds of the year.  This accounts for the almost in-
cessant rains which prevail; not only here, but in all other
places on the West Coast of Scotland.  Here, extreme cold is
never known; and it is remarkably warm close to the shores,
where snow seldom lies above 24 hours.

   Diseases.-To the dampness of the air, may, no doubt, be
attributed the frequency of the rheumatism; which is the dis-
