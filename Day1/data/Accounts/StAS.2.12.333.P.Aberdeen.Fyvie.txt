   Of illegitimate births, including cares of antenuptial fornication,
for the last three years, the average is 9.
   All the heritors are proprietors of land of the yearly value of
L.50 and upwards.  As already noticed, three of them only are
resident.
   Character of the People.-The people generally are hardy, fru-
gal, and industrious.  They do not use much flesh at ordinary meals,
the common food of the whole labouring class consisting of milk,
meal, and a few varieties of vegetables.  In consequence of the high
duty on malt, and the excise restrictions of late years on private
malting, many of them have been deprived of an indulgence which
they formerly enjoyed of beer.

                         IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Agriculture is that branch of industry in which the great body
of the people of this parish are engaged.  By the returns made to
the Government census in 1831, it appeared that there were in the
parish:

<TABLE>
Heritors, professional and other educated men,	                                12
Males engaged in agriculture, including farmers, crofters, labourers, and farm-
   servants,	                                                                800
Males engaged in retail trade and handicraft, as masters, apprentices, &c. *   135
Labourers not agricultural,	                                                 24
Number of male servants upwards of 20 years of age,	                        246
                        under 20 years,	                                        184
          female servants of all classes,	                                    237
                             Total number of servants,		                   667

   Rental.-The present real rent of the parish, according to returns
kindly furnished to me for the purposes of this account, by the se-
veral proprietors or their factors or other agents, may be stated at
L.10,000 per annum.  The following statement, made up from
the same sources of information referred to above, shews the pre-
sent scale of farm holdings: Number of crofts at and under L.5
Sterling yearly rent, 130; between L.5 and L.10, 107; L.10, and
L.20, 76.  Number of farms between L.20 and L.50, 57; L.50
and L.100, 41; L.100 and L.150, 13; L.150. and L.200, 4; at
L.200 and upwards, 4; total 432.
   To this statement I desire to append the remark, that I con-
sider the variety which it exhibits in the scale of possessions as fa-
vourable both to the temporal and moral interests of the commu-
nity.  The new improvements in agriculture, which are readily in-
troduced by occupying proprietors or the higher class of farmers,

<FOOTNOTE>Most of those engaged in retail trade and handicraft also possess small holdings
of land, and might thereby, be properly added to the list of males engaged in agricul-
ture.
