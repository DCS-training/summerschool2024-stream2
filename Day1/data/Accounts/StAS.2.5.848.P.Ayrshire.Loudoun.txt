                   O hold thy tongue, thou fair Annie,
		 And let thy talkin be,
		 For thou must stay in this fair Castle,
 		 And bear thy death with me.

		 As he sat on the nurse's knee,
		 O mother give up this fair castle.
		 Or the reek will worrie me.

		 I would rather be burnt to ashes sma;
		 And be cast on yon sea form,
		 Before I'd give up this fair castle,
 		 And my Lord so far from home.

		 My good Lord has an army strong.
		 He's now gone o'er the sea,
		 He had me keep this gay castle,
		 As long as it would keep me,

		 Gangs on yon lily lee,
		 I'd give them a' for a blast of wind,
		 To blaw the reck from me.
				 18.
		 O pittie on yon faur castle,
		 That's built with stones and lime,
		 But for mair pittie on Lady Loundon,
		 And all her children nine.
