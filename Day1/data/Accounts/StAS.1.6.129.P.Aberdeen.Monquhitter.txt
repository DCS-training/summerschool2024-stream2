the united energy of popular virtues and solid sense, he tri-
umphed over every opposition from soil, climate, and preju-
dice, gradually introducing the principles of rational farming,
and laying the foundation of progressive improvement.
   Observing that his tenants were frequently at a loss for a
market, he determined to establish a permanent one on his
own estate.  For this purpose, he planned a regular village,
contiguous to the church, upon the moorish part of a farm,
which in whole yielded only L. 11 a year.  For a while, he
felt in silence the sneers of his neighbours, who reprobated
this scheme as wild and impracticable; but these temporary
sneers soon gave way to lasting esteem.  He prevailed on a few
to take feus: he assissted the industrious with money;-obtain-
ed premiums for the manufacturer;-decided every difference
by his arbitration,-and animated all to their utmost exertion
by his countenance and counsel.  Settlers annually stocked to
Cuminestown, (the name assigned to the chief of the clan),
and the village, built of freestone, soon assumed a flourishing
appearance.  In connection with some neighbouring gentle-
men, he established in his village a linen manufacture; and
though, for particular reasons, the scheme was dropt, yet, by
introducing the spinning of linen yarn, and fixing the residence
of some capable weavers, its consequences continue to operate
for the public good.  In short, a series of sensible manage-
ment fixed upon Montquhitter 75 feus, occupied by a set of
honest, industrious, and active feuars and their tenants, who,
instead of L. 11 sterling, the original rent, produced him an-
nually from L. 120 to L. 150 a year.  Mr Cumine, during
life, was an object of general esteem; and, at his death,
had the pleasure of leaving to his heirs an annual revenue of
more than L. 600.
