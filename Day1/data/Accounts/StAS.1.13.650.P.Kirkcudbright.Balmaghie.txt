   Church, Stipend, Schools, Poor, etc.-This church, at pre-
sent almost ruinous, is about to be rebuilt.  The manse 
was built in the year 1764, and has since been repaired at
considerable expense.  An agreement has been made for 
a complete set of new offices.  Te stipend, as augmented 
in the year 1786, amounts to 2 chalders meal, 1 chalder 
bear, L. 700 Scots in money, and L. 40 Scots for commu-
nion-elements.  The whole living, including a glebe of 
14 acres, may be worth L. 112 or L. 115 Sterling a-year.
Mr Philip Morison is the present incumbent.  Thomas 
Gordon, Esq; of Balmaghie is patron.-The legal school-
salary is 200 merks Scots, or L. 11 :  2 2/3 sterling a year.
As if this were too much for one man to enjoy, the paro-
chial schoolmaster was restricted some years ago to L. 8. 2 s.
2 2/3 d. of the salary, and the balance, L. 3, was alloted to-
wards the maintenance of another teacher.  The former 
keeps school near the centre of the parish.  He may have 
on an average in winter 40 scholars, whom he instructs in
English, Latin, writing, arithmetic, book keeping, and the
principles of religion.  His income, including salary and 
fees, may amount to L. 16 a-year.  The other school-
master, (living towards the foot of the parish), has about 
16 pupils, and an income not exceeding L. 6 a-year.-At
present only 5 persons receive alms.  The funds for their 
support are the collections in the church, about L. 10, 10 s.
yearly, and the interest of L. 80 formerly saved.  Hither-
to the funds received by the session have been adequate to 
the necessities of the poor:  But there is reason to appre-
hend a diminution of these funds, as the heritors have cea-
sed to reside in the parish.  They may, indeed, and it is 
hoped they will still consider the poor, and contribute to-
wards their support.  In no country are they maintained 
at so little expense as in Scotland; but surely it is by no
