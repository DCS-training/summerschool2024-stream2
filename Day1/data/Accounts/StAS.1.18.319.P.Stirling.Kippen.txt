the house of Gartmore, commanding a view of the whole
plain below, which extends eastward for 20 or 30 miles.
The house and policy of Cardross, a few miles farther down
the country, greatly enliven the landscape.  The carse, a
rich and beautiful valley, exhibits an inclosed and well cul-
tivated country, embellished with numberless farms, and
gentlemen's seats; and in summer and autumn, often loaded
with luxuriant crops.  So rich and extensive a scenery is
rarely to be seen.  The dusky spots which are covered with
moss, please by contrast; and the imagination is gratified by
anticipating the period, when the moss shall be cleared away,
and its room occupied by the useful productions of the earth,
and the habitations of men.  Stirling castle, and the rocks of
Craig-forth and Abbeys-craig, appear on the east, like islands
emerging out of the carse.  The braes of Monteath rise on
the northern side, like an amphitheatre.  And a rugged range
of the Grampian mountains, stretching from Benlomond to
the Ochills, encompasses the whole.  Thus the eye is at
once gratified, with a prospect of rude and cultivated nature,
and with a survey of the noble effects of human industry
and art.

   Carse.-The parish of Kippen is divided by nature into the
carse and dryfield.  The former consists of the level ground
that lies on the south side of the Forth, between that river
and the rising grounds.  It is of unequal breadth, from half
a mile to a mile, and in some places more; and forms a part
of that extensive plain, which reaches from Gartmore on
both sides of the river, as far eastward as Borrowstounness.
In different places in this parish, it is covered with moss to
the extent of 300 or 400 acres.

   Moss.-There seems reason to believe, that the greater part
