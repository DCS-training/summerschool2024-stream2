naging them; and, finally, to their being attended to only
now and then as a bye job; all which circumstances are
very hurtful, and inimical to that useful, delicate, and pre-
carious animal.  Yet I am persuaded, that good sheep-farms
might be established, at least in some parts of the parish,
especially in the Highlands.  They are all of a mixed di-
minutive kind, but very prolific, and excellent eating.  I
cannot say that their wool is either good, or plenty of its
kind, which is the cause that we are principally supplied
with this necessary article from other places.
   Goat.-This animal is not so abundant in this parish as it
might have been; for though we have not many rocks or
places productive of those weeds and herbs, in which they
most delight, yet I am informed by those who keep them,
that they thrive very well.
   Swine.-These are very few of late.  To what cause this
may be owing, I know not; but about 21 years ago this
end of the parish swarmed with them, and they generally
sold well.  They are commonly of a very small size, but
far better eating, and firmer meat, than a larger kind, and
by far more easily reared.  There are some of a large size,
but they are very few.
   Geese.-A considerable number of this bird was formerly
reared in this parish.  Now they are but very few in com-
parison, which is much to be wondered at, because they
would fetch now more than double the price they gave 30
years ago.
   The present state of these articles, according to the best
of my information, is as follows:
