sides of it.  Agreeably to the tenor of that Act, the salary is
now L.25, 13s. 4d., with accommodations.  By an arrangement
lately made with Mr Dick's Trustees, the school is in charge of an
assistant teacher.  All the usual branches are taught, and the fees
are from 2s. to 5s. per quarter, and may amount, at an average,
to about L.20 per annum.  The average number of scholars is
just now about 50.
   Considering the changeable state of the population, it is impos-
sible to give an exact account of the general attainments of the
people in learning; but it is believed that few or none cannot read,
and almost all can write a little, and all seem alive to the benefits
of education.  On the south side of the river, a few children cross
the ferry tothe parochial school.  Some are taught by a woman
about a mile from the church ; but the greater number are com-
pelled to attend the schools in other parishes most adjacent.  The
late Mr Donaldson of Rosebank (a part of whose property lies
in this parish), bequeathed the bulk of his fortune for religious
and educational purposes, and from his trustees the minister lately
received the sum of L.5 Sterling for purchasing books for the
Sunday school and parish libraries, now amounting to 400 volumes.
   This parish is in connection with the district Saving Bank, late-
ly established in Ellon.
   Poor.-The number of persons receiving parochial aid has
greatly increased within these few years, for which no particular
reason can be assigned.  The following account of the receipts
and disbursements of the kirk-session for the year 1837 will an-
swer all the particulars required concerning the poor and parochial
funds:-

   The poor seldom or never seek parochial relief till their neces-
sities are apparent; but less objection is made to receiving it than
formerly.
