     Statistical Account

which has a S. E. direction, have been wrought many
years ago, by crop levels.  The coal dips nearly in the
same manner and direction as in the west of the parish,
but is freer of dikes.  This colliery was purchased in sum-
mer 1785 by Messrs Campbell, Morison and Company.
They have built two large engines.  The one is erected
on stone, and the other on a frame of wood.  From this
colliery vast quantities of coal are at present exported.
The same seams are found in the lands of Praithouse, and
run eastward to the crossgates into the neighbouring pa-
rish.
   Sinking pits is not difficult in this parish.  The cover
generally consists of a few fathoms of earth, and afterward
freestone and blue metals.
