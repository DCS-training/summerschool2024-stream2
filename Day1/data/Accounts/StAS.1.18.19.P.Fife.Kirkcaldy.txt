   2. The contributions which were then made for purposes
of charity, and still more for the support of the state, shew
the place to have been respectable.  In 1622, when the Gene-
ral Assembly of the protestant churches in France deputed
Basnage to the King of Great Britain, to sollicit aid forresisting
the oppression of Lewis XIII. the town and parish of Kirkal-
dy contributed, according to the gudervill and permission of the
King, a pecuniary aid of 1030 merks*.  During a period of
12 years, from 1634 to 1645, at which time money was so
valuable as to bear interest at 9 per cent. the weekly collec-
tions at the church doors were greater than they are at pre-
sent; the average amounting to L. 73: 10; while that of the
same number of years preceding 1791 does not exceed L. 63
9 s. 4 d.

   Public Assessments.-In all public assessments, the town
was rated as the sixth burgh, and assessed in the proportion of
1 to 40 of the whose supplies levied from the burghs of Scot-
land+.  For several years before and after 1650, the month-
ly assessments laid on it, for the maintenance of troops, exceed-

past been much neglected, let one half more be added for births not entered,
and the whole annual births will, on an average of 20 years, be 75; which,
compared with the actual numbers, is nearly in the proportion of 1 to 35.  Es-
timated by this proportion, the population from 1650 to 1660 would exceed
4000.
There is no public register of burials.  But by a very exact list kept by the
grave-digger for his own use, it appears, that the average of burials for 14 years
preceding 1788 was 44 1/2, which is to the population nearly as 1 to 59.

quent acts of Parliament.  The burghs which were rated higher were Edin-
burgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Perth, and at first St. Andrews; but
the assessment of that burgh gradually fell to a fourth part of that of Kirkaldy.
