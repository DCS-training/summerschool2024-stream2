   Character.-They are generally sober and industrious.
A few years ago a spirit of smuggling too much prevailed
in this corner, than which nothing is more ruinous to the
health and morals of those who are addicted to it*.  There
is reason to believe that little or no gain was made by that
most mischievous traffic, of the effects of which the mini-
ster, from time to time, did not fail to remind them from
the pulpit.  This ruinous traffic is now nearly annihilated
among us; and happy were it for the nation that the temp-
tations to it were less frequent and powerful than they
sometimes are.  None of the people of this parish have
been the subject of a criminal process, nor have any of them
emigrated.

*One young man, a tenant in the parish, was most unhappily addicted to
it; in a few years he hurt many others, and ruined himself The last time
he called at the manse, he expressed his wish that he had followed the advice
the minister had often given him.-Had he done this, he had probably suc-
ceeded as a tenant, and escaped those miseries which, by smuggling he un-
happily brought upon himself.  He lay in a prison for several months, reduced
to great indigence.  This is mentioned as a warning to others, who by
smuggling hope to be made rich, but are far more likely to become
ruined, and to entail misery and mischief on themselves and others.
