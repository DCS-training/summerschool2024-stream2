     Statistical Account

   Air, Climate, Diseases.-The air is commonly clear and
falubrious, excepting sometimes in the evening, about the end
of April, or the beginning of May, when the wind is wester-
ly.  In the pleasantest days, and sometimes for several days
together we see the fog rising on the German Ocean, about
3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon; and, even when we enjoy the
most delightful sunshine, we know, that, in an hour or two,
we shall be involved in darkness, that may almost be felt.  So
slowly does the damp approach, that it is often some hours be-
sore it reach us, after we see it a-coming.  In general, how-
ever, the inhabitants are remarkably healthy.  About 25 or
30 years ago, the ague, especially in the spring, was so ge-
neral, that many farmers found it difficult to sow and harrow
their lands in the proper season, owing to their servants being so
much afflicted with it.  At present, this disease is little known
in this parish, or in the neighbourhood.  This is perhaps
owing to the draining of the grounds, the great change
that has taken place in the mode of living, dress, etc.  Every
year, several children die of the small pox, the prejudices a-
gainst inoculation being still very great.  In vain, the patrio-
tic Mr Dempster provided, last season, an able physician and
proper medicines:  Though inoculation, by these means,
might have been got gratis, hardly one accepted the generous
offer.

   Rivers and Fish.-The Finny and Lunan, both of which
rise in the parish of Forfar, either pass along, or partly inter-
sect the parish of Kirkden.  There is excellent burn-trout in
both, which are, however, every year, much destroyed with
the  watering of flax, either in the rivulets themselves, or in
places from whence the deadly streams run into them.  Eels
are also caught in the season; and sea fish are brought from 
the coast in considerable quantities.
