mile north east from the castle, in a very level moor of con-
siderable extent, exhibiting no token of having ever produced
wood of any kind.  Their number is considerable; but not
certainly ascertained; for the people who have lately settled
as improvers on the moor, discover from time to time, one
unobserved before.  Their entrance commonly from the
western end, is not larger than may be shut by many of the
greater stones scattered over the moor.  The inside of the
largest yet seen, measures about 16 or 20 feet in length,
and about 6 or 7 in breadth at the floor; the walls are about
4 feet high, untouched by the mason's hammer, and without
mortar of any kind; approaching to each other gradually,
from the foundation, so as to be covered at the level of the
moor by flag-stones about 3 feet in length, above which the
excavated earth has been carelessly accumulated; so as while
the rain is thereby carried off, the external appearance is that
only of a shapeless hillock, suggesting no idea of its contents.
   These remotely ancient abodes, carry back our contem-
plations to a state of society, when the principles upon
which the arch is constructed, were nearly, but not com-
pletely discovered; and by comparing the structure of these
concealed abodes; with the most durable monuments of the
wisdom of Egypt, the most venerable fanes of celebrated
Asia, and the most elegant temples of polished Greece,
there will be found reason to believe, that those principles
undiscovered by the ingenuity of the most renowned nations,
were first known among our own rude ancestors.  But as
Tacitus hath mentioned, (Mor. Germ. C. 16.) that such ha-
bitations were also common among the ancient savages of
the Continent, we are not certain that the whole credit of dis-
covering this important branch of architecture belongs to
ourselves.
