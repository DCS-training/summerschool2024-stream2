maid schipwrak of the faith, he during the tyme of his abode heirs,
had his most frequent and commone resorte, residence, and re-
maining within the boundis of the Presbyterie of Irwing, quhair he
was resset, suppleit, and comfortit in all his necessaries be Mr Johne
Harpar, minister at Kilbryd, and Johnne Fullarton, minister at
Dreghorne, Mr Alexander Scrimgeour, minister at Irwing, Mr
Johnne Young, minister at Beath, and Mr Alexander Campbell,
minister at Stevensoun, minesteris of the said Presbeterie, quha
nocht onlie keipit cumpany and societie with him in all friendly
and familiar discourseis, but interteyned him in their houses, mi-
nistering unto him all suche comforter, countenance, favor, and as-

disgrace of thair professioun and calling, misregard of his Ma-
