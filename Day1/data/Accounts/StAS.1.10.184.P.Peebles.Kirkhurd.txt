The farmers sustained great losses, after all the deductions
that was made of their rents by the lairds.  They bought the
whole of their feed-oats next spring from Lothian and Rox-
burghshire.  One heritor commissioned a considerable quan-
tity of oats from Effex, sowed part of them himself, and dis-
tributed part among his tenants.  The kirk-session bought
several loads of oat-meal and sold it to cottars and house-
holders at 1 s. the peck.  This, with the white beans brought
from Leith, gave great relief.  They have resolved this year

it out at a reduced price, in case these articles should rise to

ceives any benefit; at the end of which time, if he is unable
to work, is entitled to 2 s. per week, The capital is now
80 L.  As the fund increases, they intend to make a small

clergy have countenanced this Society, by giving a sermon at
the annual meeting.  The collection at that time is for be-
hoof of the Society.
