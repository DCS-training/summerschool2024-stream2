of Dundurcus was divided between those of Boharm and Rothes.
Whether the reasons calling for such a proceeding were at the
time well or ill founded, it is not our province to inquire; but in
the present altered state of manners and society, and the increas-
ed population of the country, a disjunction io this case, as well
as in others similarly situated, would seem to be both politic and
advantageous.

    The parish is situated partly in the county of Elgin and partly
in the county of Banff. The number of persons residing in El-
ginshire is 1794; males. 828; females 966. In Banffshire, 49;
males, 25; females, 24. From this it will appear that, in the vil-
lage, the number of females over males is 98, and in the rural dis-
tricts, 39, and in the whole parish 137; and the average number
of persons to each inhabited house, 4. In the year 1831, the po-
pulation of the whole parish was 1709; the increase in 1841,
therefore, is 134.
The number of illegitimate births in the parish within the last
three years, is 8.
The inhabitants of the village consist chiefly of mechanics and
agricultural labourers. No manufacture of any consequence is
carried on, if we except small quantities of rough blanketing, &c.
Within the last two years, one of the most extensive distilleries in
the north has been established in it by Messrs J. and J. Grant; in
which establishment, between 30,000 and 40,000 gallons of whisky
are annually made.  The distillery is constructed to distil nearly
1500 gallons per week.
  Though the people are, for the most part, attached to their na-
tive place, and seem not to desire to remove far, or for any length
of time, beyond its bounds, yet there are some individuals, whom
