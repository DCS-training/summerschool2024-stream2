     I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
     Name.--The word Kirkcolm is a corruption of Kirk Columba,
the parish having been named after St Columba, who flourished
in the sixth century. It is uncertain whether this celebrated per-
son was born in Ireland or Scotland, but, according to Buchanan
and Spottiswood, he was held in great repute in the latter coun-
try. He established himself in one of the western islands, called
from him Icolmkill, or the chapel of Columba, and devoted his
life to the conversion of the natives to Christianity. Missionaries
emanated from that island to preach the Gospel in various parts
of the west of Scotland; and the church built in this district was
dedicated to him.
     Extent, Boundaries &c.-- This parish is a small peninsula, sur-
rounded by the sea on all sides except the south, where it is bounded
by the parish of Leswalt. Its average breadth, from the bay of
Loch Ryan to the Irish Channel, is 4 miles: its length, along
the west coast of Loch Ryan, from 5 to 5 1/2 miles. On this coast
there is a shelving bank of sand, called the Scar, running oblique-
ly into the loch about a mile, not entirely covered by the sea at
the highest spring tides: it forms a natural basin called the Wig,
which affords a secure anchorage in severe weather for small ves-
sels, while ships of larger size find a safe retreat on the opposite
coast of the locb, where there is greater depth of water.
     Topographical Appearances.--The parish generally presents to
the eye an undulating surface. The hills partake of the charac-
ter of the adjoining parts of the country; they are never high
nor steep, and the absence of abrupt or rocky acclivities has en-
