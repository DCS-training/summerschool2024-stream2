vant, for common household or farm work, has L. 3a-
year, and 2 pairs of shoes, worth 6 s.  A labouring man,
and whose wife has been a moderate share of industry, can

This, with potatoes, is their food for half the year.  For
the other half, they live on oat-meal, milk, and sometimes

quarters of a year.  Such of them as have a milk cow,
which most of them have, gather as much dung as enables
them to raise a sufficient quantity of this useful root.  The
farmers always give them as much land as they can fur-
nish manure for.

ables them to understand the English language, and, in
some measure, to speak it;  but still their mother tongue
is much more familiar to them.  In their common conver-
sation, whichever language they attempt, there is a mix-
ture of the idioms and phrases of both.  Let such as have
a partiality for the Gaelic, commit it ti writing, whist
yet its purity may be traced, and it will always afford plea-
