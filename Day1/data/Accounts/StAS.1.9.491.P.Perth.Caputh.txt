year, as late as the 3d of July.

Population. - It is a subject of regret, that the session re-
cords of country parishes have been generally kept in a
manner so slovenly and negligent, that it is now almost im-
possible to form a just estimate of their population a century
ago, or even less. There is also a peculiar difficulty in ma-
king such an estimate with regard to this parish. Previous
to the year 1728, its population was greater than it could
be expected to be at any subsequent period; because those
distant parts (already noticed) which are immediately ad-
jacent to the town of Dunkeld on the N. and W. were then
joined respectively to these parishes quoad facra, in conse-
quence of a formal recommendation of the Presbytery;
and from that time ceased to be under the inspection of the
minister of Caputh. With respect to the following lists ta-
ken from the parish-register, it is to be remarked, 1. That
many children in distant parts of the parish, not being bap-
tized by the minister, are neglected to be registered by the
parents. 2. That many of the inhabitants bury in other
parishes, and never pay the tax imposed by act of Parlia-
ment in 1783, which, being unpopular, is not collected in
some places. No accurate conclusion, therefore, can be
drawn from these lists of
