being embalmed, was sent over to Scotland soon after, and
buried in great pomp, at Kilsyth.  It was inclosed, first in a
leaden coffin, nicely cemented; that again with a very strong
wooden coffin.  The space between the two coffins, was
filled up with a white matter, somewhat of the consistency
and colour of putty; but of a rich and delicious aromatic
flavour.  It is but a few years ago, since this matter was
laid open, by the decay of the wooden coffin.  And a few
weeks ago, the lead coffin was perfectly entire.  But some
rude thoughtless people, having gone to visit the tomb, with
sacrilegious hands tore up the lead covering.  To their great
surprise, they found under it a board of fir, as clean and
fresh, as if it had been formed yesterday.  This being loosened,
by the removal of the lead, they, to their utmost astonish-
ment, found the body of Lady Kilsyth, and her child, as
entire as the hour they were entombed.
   Every feature, and every limb, is as full, nay the very
shroud is as clear and fresh and the ribbans as bright, as
the very day they were lodged in the tomb.  What renders
the scene truly interesting as well as striking, is, that the
body of her son and only child, the natural heir of the titles
and estates of Kilsyth, lies at her knee.  His features are as
composed, as if he were only asleep.  His colour is as fresh,
and his flesh as full, as if in the perfect glow of health.  He
seems to have been an infant of the age of 3 months.
   The body of Lady Kilsyth, is equally well preserved: and
it would not be easy for a stranger to distinguish with his
eye, whether she is dead or alive.  For, with the elegant

on the right temple; and is still as distinct, as on the day she received it.
The child seems to have received no other injury, than that of being smo-
thered in the arms of its mother.
