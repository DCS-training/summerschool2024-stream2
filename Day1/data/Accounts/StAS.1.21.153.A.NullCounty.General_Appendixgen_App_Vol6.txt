ses upon their estates, that the subsoil in Kincardine moss is
a clay of a very rich quality, and peculiarly favourable for
this method of improvement.  But, the very same clay is to
be found at the bottom of many of our mosses in Scotland.
Most of our extensive mosses are bottomed by clay, or by a
mixture of clay and sand; which, with a proportion of peat
earth, forms a most improvable soil.  Wherever timber is
found in a moss, it must have grown on the soil at the bot-
tom; and wherever large trees have grown, on a plain, or
in a valley, there must remain a soil well worth cultivation.
It will be observed, on the perusal of this paper, that the
great obstacle to the undertaking was the want of a sufficient
command of water, which occasioned a considerable expence.
But in many of our mosses in Scotland there is no such ob-
stacle; and consequently all such expence may be avoided.
   The most important part of this plan is, the nature of the
tenure by which the people who improve the moss are to
hold their possessions.  In whatever way our mosses are to
be reduced to culture, it will be found, that this sort of te-
nure, or something similar to it, is the most effectual means
to attain the end.

   THE moss of Kincardine is situated in the parish of the
same name, comprehended betwixt the rivers Forth and
Teith, and in that district of Perthshire called Monteith.
The moss begins about a mile above the confluence of these
rivers; from thence it extends in length about four miles,
and from one to two in breadth; and before the commence-
ment of the operations, (an account of which is to be given)
comprehended near 2000 acres, of which about 1500 belong
to the estate of Blair-Drummond, the property of Lord Kames
by his marriage with Mrs Drummond of Blair-Drummond.
   As mosses are extremely various in their nature; before
