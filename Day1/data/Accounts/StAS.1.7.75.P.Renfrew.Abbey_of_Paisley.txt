     of the Abbey Parish of Paisley

   Surface and Soil.-It is generally of a gently waving sur-
face, frequently swelling, especially in the neighbourhood of
Paisley, into beautiful little eminences.  A considerable part
of it to the north of the town is a perfect level, having been
anciently moss, extending in the year 1719, when a survey
of it was made, to about 300 acres; but now reduced to
about 130 by the operation of burning, which, in dry seasons,
is still carried on with success.  The south part of the parish
rises into a tract of hilly ground, known by the name of
Paisley or Stanley Braes.  The greatest elevation to which
these grounds rise in this parish is about 680 feet above flood-
mark at Paisley.  Part of them is moss and heath, but the
bulk of them is good sheep pasture, and even a considerable
part of them arable.  The soil of the parish, as may be ex-
pected in such an extensive district, varies.  It is in general
thin, with a bottom of gravel, more frequently of till, very
retentive of moisture.  In the flat grounds, and along the
banks of the rivers, it is rich and fertile; less so, thinner, and
more stony, as it rises to the south.

   Air and Diseases.-The air is moist, a necessary consequence
of the prevailing south-west winds, which, coming loaded
with vapour from the Atlantic, produce frequent and heavy
rains.  The effects of this moist atmosphere appear in rheu-
matisms, quinseys, pneumonic ailments, and all the tribe of
inflammatory disorders.  Upon the whole, however, this pa-
rish, and even the neighbouring town, cannot be said to be
unhealthy.  Contagions, indeed, at times visit this as other
places, which run their usual course as epidemics; but none
are remembered of any uncommon violence, except a pleuri-
sy in summer 1771, and which, contrary to the received opi-
nion, was truly epidemic.  There are no disorders that can
be said to be endemic, unless scrophula is to be excepted,
