     of Lonmay.

   Population.-The return to Dr Webster in 1755 was
1674 souls. The number of inhabitants of all ages at pre-
sent is about 1650.  Of which, 311 are Scotch Episcopals,
and 17 are Seceders.  If we may judge from the situation
of the church of St Colm, (of which part of the west grebe
still remains, and which stood on the north-east part of the
parish, 10 miles from the south by west extremity), popu-
lation has formerly been very thin in this parish, except on
the sea-coast.

   Agriculture.-The agriculture of this district, though
certainly improved of late years by the introduction of
lime and green crops, has not advanced so much as might
have been expected.  One great error of the Buchan far-
mers, which is apt to strike even a stranger riding through
the country, is the ploughing too seldom.  In deep clay
soils, where, in the county of Angus, three ploughings are
always used, beans are frequently sown broadcast after one
ploughing, and bear after beans in the same manner.  Yet
a very good crop of drilled beans is to be seen this year
(1795) upon a farm in the personal possession of one of the
heritors.  It is also to be remarked, that a rotation of crops
is not yet established in this district.  While the heritor
only ploughs where he cannot get grass to grow any longer,
the tenant sometimes ploughs as long as corn of any kind
will grow.  A regular rotation of crops, adapted to the dif-
ferent soils, is too little attended to in this district; and now
that lime is very generally used, the lands may suffer from
injudicious cropping.

   Rent of the Parish.-The rent of this parish is about
2000 guineas; and may be supposed to increase with the
improvements in agriculture.
