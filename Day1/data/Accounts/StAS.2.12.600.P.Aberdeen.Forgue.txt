abound in trout; and some of them have their edges in some
places beautifully fringed with alder.  Besides a vast number of
common springs, we have indifferent places mineral or chalybeate
ones.
   Geology and Mineralogy.-The minerals common in the neigh-
bouring parishes may be found in this.  At Pitfancy limestone
was formerly quarried in considerable quantity, as, at Lambhill,
was likewise slate.  The quarrying at both places has, however,
been given up.  The soils are various,-sandy, gravelly, clayey,
loamy, and mossy; some rich and grateful, some poor and bar-
ren; some yielding eight, or even ten returns of the seed sown,
and some no more than two or two and a half.

                         II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   The early history of the parish is involved, like that of most
parihes, in darkness; and tradition speaks of it as remarkable for
nothing so much as the almost perpetual and desperate feud be-
tween the Crichton family and the family of Gordon.
   Eminent Men.-This parish claims to be the birth-place of the
famous James Crichton, who, about the middle of the sixteenth
century, made such a conspicuous figure in the world, from his
surpassing genius and learning, his bodily feats and mental ac-
quirements, that be obtained the appellation of the Admirable
Crichton.  A parish in Perthshire, however, denies to this the
honour of his birth; "non nostrum tantas componere lites." Mr
Morison, the famous Hygeist, was a native of this parish; and
Dr Abercrombie, the present eminent physician in Edinburgh,
is connected with it, his father having been for some time minis-
ter of the parish.
   Land-owners.-The land-owners, in the order of their valued
rent, are as follows:
