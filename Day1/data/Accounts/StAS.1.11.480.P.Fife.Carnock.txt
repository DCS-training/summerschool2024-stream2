   Situation, Extent, Surface, and Hills.-This parish is situ-
ated in the western extremity of the county of Fife.  Its
form is nearly square, if we except an excrescence containing
the barony of Pitdennies, which terminates in the village of
Cairney-hill, and extends the whole breadth of the parish at
its southern extremity.  The length and breadth are about 3
English miles at a medium+.  The ground is level towards
the E., but has a gentle declivity towards the S., and is
bounded on the N. and N. E. by some hills, which terminate
in a precipice, called Craig-Luscar, beyond the limits of the
parish.  Other hills, called the Clums, separate this parish
from that of Saline.  Most of the ground consists of gentle
declivities.  The Camp's Bank on the S. and Carneil Hill on
the W. are considerable eminences, commanding extensive
prospects of the Frith of Forth, and the country adjacent.
The former has a fine exposure towards the S., consisting
mostly of arable land greatly improved; the latter consists of
excellent pasture.

   Soil, Produce; Woods, etc-The soil is partly black earth,
and partly clay or till.  In several places there is a mixture
of gravel near the surface; but the two first species of soil
are most prevalent, and the country is of consequence pretty
fertile.  The hills, except such as are in tillage, are in general
covered with grass; but the heath begins to appear upon the
rising grounds towards the N. The ground produces crops
of oats, barley, pease, wheat, turnips, and sown grass, in con-
siderable quantities.  There is also natural grass, mixed with
several herbs, and fit for pasture, on those grounds, which
