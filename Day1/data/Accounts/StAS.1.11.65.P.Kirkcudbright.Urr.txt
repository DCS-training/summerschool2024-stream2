of tranquillity the country enjoyed.  In the year 1740, how-
ever, shell marl was discovered in Galloway; and the abund-
ant crops, produced by the use of this manure, encouraged
the landholders, to let out for tillage large tracts of land,
which had been enclosed for the purpose of grazing black cat-
tle.  A spirit of industry began then to be disfused amongst
the tenantry and labourers, which was, however, considerably
cramped by the vicinity of the Isle of Man, with which the
inhabitants of Galloway carried on a considerable smuggling
trade.  But that island having been made subject, about the
year 1760, to the revenue regulations of Great Britain, it is
inconceivable how much the agriculture of every parish, in
the maritime parts of Galloway, was benefited: The impor-
tation of lime from England, by water carriage, soon became
frequent; (this manure is now carried 15 miles up into the
country from Dalbeaty Port); a corn trade sprung up with
Greenock, and other towns on the west coast of Scotland, as
well as with Whitehaven, Liverpool, and other ports most
adjacent in England; and the profperity and opulence of this
parish, as well as the vicinity, have ever since continued to
improve.

   Produce and Black Cattle.-Oats, barley, a little wheat, and
black cattle, form the far greater part of the produce of Urr.
In the year 1782, it was computed, that the oats and barley,
sold out of the parish, amounted to the value of 4,000 l.  Po-
tatoes also form a considerable article of commerce, especially
with the English ports.  As to the number of black cattle
disposed of yearly, it is impossible this can be fixed, with any
precision, as many farmers keep what are called running
stocks, i.e. buy in and sell out several times in the year.  Pro-
bably, however, if every farmer was to breed his own sale
cattle, the parish might produce 800 bullocks, of two and a
half years old, which might annually be sent to England, or
