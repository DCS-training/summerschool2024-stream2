     Of Speymouth.

   Face of the Country, Soil and climate.-At the dis-
tance of about half a mile from the sea, the ground rises
suddenly to a small hill.  Beyond this, there is almost
one continued plain for 3 1/2 miles in length, and about
1 1/4 in breadth, bounded on the side towards the river by
a steep bank from 40 to 50 feet in height.  At the end
of this plain, the ground again rises and terminates in a
high hill to the S.  The soil is for the most part light.
About one half of the arable ground is good fertile soil,
being a light loam, of sufficient depth, on a bottom of
black earth or clay; the other half is a thin, gravelly,
sharp soil, on a hard gravelly bottom; in some parts it
is sandy.  The grounds below the bank above mention-
ed, and between it and the river, are almost all very
good soil, especially that part towards the S., called the
Haugh of Dipple, extending about a mile in length, and
3-4ths of a mile in breadth.  The cultivated ground lies,
for the most part, on the side towards the river; but
towards the two extremities, it falls back nearly the
whole breadth of the parish.  About the middle also,
there are 2 pretty extensive farms near the boundary to
the W.  The cultivated ground is equal to about one
third part of the whole extent of the parish: the pasture
ground will be about 530 acres: there are about 300
acres in plantations of wood: about 50 acres of moss
ground: 110 acres of pebbles, or bare beach, along the

said to signify "low." Garmouth, or, as it is commonly pronounced, and
probably should be written Garmach, a town or village situated at the
mouth of Spey, is said to signify the "rough outlet," either from the ra-
pidity of the river, or the roughness of the beach near its mouth.  Balna-
coul, the "town of Gaul:" Lunan, a "low lying place on the side of
a river."
