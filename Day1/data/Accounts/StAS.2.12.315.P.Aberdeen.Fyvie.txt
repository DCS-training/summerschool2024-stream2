extensive moss of Foudlin, in the parish of Forgue, where they
have an abundant supply.  English coal carted from the port of
Banff or Macduff is also a good deal used.

               MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   Looking to this parish as a whole, and marking the many
changes which have taken place in it since the date of the
former Statistical Account, it may safely be said, that it has
not been behind others in the march of general improvement.
Agriculture, in particular, has made wonderful progress, and
that, not more, perhaps, in the greater extent of ground culti-
vated, than in the superior management and direction, exhibit-

bandry have been removed-new roads have been cut-mill mul-
tures, at one time very heavy, amounting to one-seventeenth part
when work was done, and to one-twenty-first independent of any
work, have now for the most part been extinguished.  The standard
of comfort among the people has become elevated, their ideas less
contracted, their knowledge and information more extensive, and
their manners and habits more refined; and it is hoped that, in
matters still more important and sacred, improvements also have
taken place.

also been clearly traced to Gaelic original.  Fyvie is one of the
