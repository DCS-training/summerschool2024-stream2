very diminutive stature.  They do not consider, that a man
who is slain in the field of battle, and not strethed, when
warm, to his full length, must necessarily occupy a shorter
grave than one of an equal stature on whom this operation
has been performed.
   We do not pretend to say when, or by whom, this battle
was sought, which was the occasion of raising these tumuli,
for the burial of their dead, and as monuments of the event.
Tradition says, that, towards the end of the Pictish king-
dom, a battle was sought betwixt the Picts and Scots near
Bathgate, not far from the spot; it is probable this battle
happend about the same time, and betwixt the same par-

off the field, had no opportunity of burying their dead; and
the victorious army never did it in this manner, unless the
victory was so complete, that they thought it entitled, and
they had sufficient time, to erect such laborious monu-
ments.
   A conjecture arises, that the principal carnage of the
vanquished army having taken place upon a rising ground
upon the other side of the river, immediately opposite to
these tumuli, and the bodies being there left to corrupt in
the open air, that field may have acquired the name of the
Maukes Hill, which it still retains.
   We have already gone out of the parish, but merely for

with its history.  We are now about to dive into the cen-

pardon of the gentleman who has already written the ac-
