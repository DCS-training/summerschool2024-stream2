that this church, instead of being used only for spiritual purposes,
was employed as a court house long after the Scots canons had
prohibited such an abuse; and in proof of this assertion he men-
tions, that it was here, in 1342, that the celebrated Sir Alexander
Ramsay of Dalhousie was exercising his judicial functions as She-
riff of Teviotdale, when he was rudely assaulted by Sir William
Douglas of Liddesdale, and carried off to Hermitage Castle, in
one of whose solitary dungeons he was left to perish of hunger.
Nor was this sacred edifice profaned by acts of violence merely,
whilst prostituted to other purposes than the celebration of reli-
gious worship.  It seems also in ancient times to have been made
the scene of the grossest superstition.  For we find from the
charter granted to the town by Sir James Douglas of Drumlanrig,
that several particates of land were not only allocated to the chap-
lain of Hawick, but that special provision was made "for finding
and furnishing one lamp or pot of burning oil before the altar of
the blessed Virgin Mary, within the parish church, at the time
of the great mass and the vesper or evening prayers, all the holi-
days of the year, in honour of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and pray-
ing for the souls of the Barons of Hawick, founders of the foresaid
lamp, and their successors."
  The present church, which is situated about fourteen miles from
the western and one and a-half from the eastern boundary of the
parish, was built in 1764, and has neither been enlarged nor ma-
terially altered since that time.  Though devoid of every architec-
tural embellishment, it has the advantage of a good site, being
built on a circular rising ground in the centre of the town, and,
though somewhat difficult of access, is, in point of locality, conve-
niently situated for the great mass of the population.  It so hap-
pens, however, that the accommodation is not only exceedingly in-
adequate, inasmuch as there are sittings only for 704, whilst the
population of the parish amounts to 5998, but the great body of
the people who are resident in the town, and who amount to 5306
have, strictly speaking, no legal right to any part of the accommo-
dation it affords.  Two-thirds of the entire area were originally al-
located to the heritors and tenants in the landward part of the pa-
rish, whilst the other third, affording accommodation to about 234,
is all that is reserved for the town, and not only so, but even this
part of the church, limited as it is, is accessible to those only who
are either proprietors, or are capable of  paying  a considerable
seat-rent. There are, moreover, no sittings set for the poor
