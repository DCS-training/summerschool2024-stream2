   The rent of land, when let out in small parcels, is 20 s.
the Scotch acre; and, in larger farms, about 15 s.  Land of
an inferior quality less from 6 s. to 10 s.  Bailey harvest be-
gins generally about the middle of September, though oats
are commonly three weeks later.  An earlier species of oats
has of late been introduced, which succeeds well on ground
in good heart, and is as soon ready as barley.
   In 1782, there was a great deficiency in the crop, owing
to the frost coming on early, and preventing the grain from
coming to maturity.  Had it not been for a very consider-
able importation, the consequences must have been fatal.
The deficiency of the succeeding crop arose entirely from
the badness of the seed.  Even oats that appeared little infe-
rior in plumpness and colour to the produce of ordinary
years, proved equally unfit for seed as the poorest grain.
They looked well on their first coming above ground, but
soon after totally disappeared*.

   Manufactures, Etc.-In this parish there are 9 weavers, 3
turners, chiefly employed in making spinning wheels, 1 car-
penter, 4 taylors, 4 shoemakers, 2 shopkeepers, and 12 ma-
sons.  The latter are not much employed within the parish;
but they find work in the southern counties, and reside here
in the winter.
   The women are employed in spinning linen yarn, from
flax partly of their own rearing, and partly imported from
Holland by the manufacturers.  The latter kind is spun
from 6 to 8 hanks in the pound, and varies in the price of
spinning according to the demand.  Flax of home growth is
spun from 2 to 5 hanks in the pound, and is sold at an an-
