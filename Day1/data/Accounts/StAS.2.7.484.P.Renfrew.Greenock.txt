           Mr Wilson, writing in 1811, when the plan of providing for the
	poor by voluntary contribution had not yet failed of success, de-
	clares himself decidedly favourable to this method.
	   Let us now attend to the mode of making provision by legal as-
        sessment. We shall first of all show its amount in the years af-
	ter the union of the three parishes, when the raising of money by
        assessment was finally established; after which we shall compare
	the expenditure in its various items under that system with the ex-
	penditure in 1810 already noticed-requesting the reader to bear
	in mind, that the assessment money is only a part of the revenue,
	and that the managers of the funds for the poor continue to re-
	ceive as before the ordinary Sabbath-day collections, proclama-
        tion-fees, &c. It is also necessary to mention, that in 1817 a
	larger sum than usual was required to defray the expense of a pro-
	tracted litigation, in which the heritors were engaged, before the
	passing of the Act of Parliament prescribing the mode of imposing
	the assessment.*
	   The population by Goverment census in 1811 was 19,042.  The
	three parishes were assessed in the followinf years in the sum of,

        	In 1817,	          L.3100	          In 1822,             L.3300
                   1818,	            2696		     1823,               2800
                   1819,	            2909	             1824,               2750
                   1820,                    2925	             1825,               2700

           The assessment is on the real rental, deducting one-fifth for repairs.  For the
        last three years it has been 6 1/2 per pound.
