and 48 years.  At 30 years of age, 32.27 years = a minister's
expectation of life.  At 48 years of age, 19.44 years =
widow's expectation of life; which last, multiplied by
19.3, the number of widows left yearly, produces 375.2 =
maximum of annuitants upon the widows scheme."
   " Farther, from 36 parish accounts, published in the first
volume of the Statistical Account of Scotland, it appears, there
are 46.625 souls in these parishes: the mean number of births
and deaths is 1156. Hence 46625/1156 = 40.3, the expectation of
an infant's life in these 36 parishes ; which agrees almost ex-
actly with the same expectation by my table.  Many of these
parishes are in different counties, and situated widely remote
from each other."

   Mr Wilkie proposes soon to publish a book " On the Theo-
" ory of Interest simple and compound, derived from first
" principles, and applied to annuities :  With an illustration
" of the Widows Scheme in the Church of Scotland : " -A
work, which will probably throw much light upon these im-
portant subjects of inquiry.  In the mean while, the following ta-
ble of the probabilities of life, derived from the bills of mortali-
ty, in the parish of Torthorwald, County of Dumfries, for
27 years, ending anno 1790, published in the appendix to this
volume, is well entitled to be laid before the reader.
