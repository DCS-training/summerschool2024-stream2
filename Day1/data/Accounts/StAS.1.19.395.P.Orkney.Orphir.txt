     of Orphir.

   Situation and Extent.-This parish is situated in the
county and synod of Orkney, and int he presbytery of Cair-
ston, and makes a part of the isle of Pomona, commonly
called Mainland, from its being the largest of the Orkney
islands.
   It is bounded on the N. W. and N. by the parishes of
Sternes and Firth, from which it is divided by a range of
lofty hills; by the parish of Kirkwall on the N. E.; and
on the E. S. and W. by the Orkney Mediterranean, gene-
rally known by the name of Scalpa Flow.
   It is about eight English miles long, and from two to
three miles in breadth; lying along the sea-shore, nearly
in the direction of N. E. and S. W. and enjoys a fine ex-
posure.
   The face of the parish is diversified with hills and dales
through which many rivulets flow.  The soil, in a few
places near the coast, is a rich loam, mixed with stones,
and tolerably fertile; but, in general, it is clay or moss, or
a mixture of both; and when well manured, though but
indifferently cultivated, is more than sufficient to maintain
the inhabitants.
   The upper part of the parish, except a few small farms,
near a lake, called the Loch of Kirbister, is hilly, and
chiefly covered with heath, intermixed with coarse grass,
and well adapted for the breeding of sheep and small cattle.
The lower part, toward the S. E. S. and W. and extending
about a mile from the hills to the sea-shore, is in general
plain, and beautifully diversified with corn-fields, meadows,
and green pasture.  The eastern district is interspersed with
rising grounds, covered with heath, and large peat-mosses,
which furnish the inhabitants with fuel, and enable them
to supply the neighbouring town of Kirkwall.
