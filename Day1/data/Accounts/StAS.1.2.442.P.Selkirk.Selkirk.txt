the sheep with a composition of butter or tar, which, though
it spoils the colour, yet is said to improve the quality, and to
increase the quantity of the wool.  It saves the flocks also,
from the influence of the winter rains, from the scab and ver-
min of every kind, except the tick.
   The quantity of tar, used in smearing the sheep, varies ac-
cording to the height of the sheep walk, and the want of shel-

of the quantity, that is necessary in the high lands; which is
from 1 1/2 to 3 lb. of butter to each Scots pint of tar.
   The farms here are never valued according to the quantity

the pasture of these, according to their size, and the foundness
of the ground, is valued at from is 6d. to 3s. per head.-

1604 to 1618 above the bed of the river at Selkirk.
