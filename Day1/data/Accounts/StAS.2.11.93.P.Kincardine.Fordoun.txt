<TABLE> Agriculture.--Table showing the extent and disposition of
lands in the parish.

                          Arable.        Wood.       ground.           Total
Imperial acres,           11,330         2159        14,246           27,2735

	The undivided common land may amount to about 200 acres;
of the waste land, capital could not be profitably employed, in
bringing much into cultivation,--probably not more than 300
or 400 acres in the parish would pay the expense of improve-
ment.
	In forming plantations, larch, Scots fir, and spruce are gene-
rally planted, either for nurses, or for a crop ; when planted as
nurses, the plantation is generally filled up with oak, ash, elm,
beech, birch, sycamore, &c.; little regard being paid how far the
soil may be adapted to their growth.  As the deciduous trees
grow up, the resinous trees are thinned out to make room for
them, but invariably too little attention is paid to pruning the
trees intended to form the crop.  The value of thinnings, and of
wood cut down and sold in the parish, does not exceed L.180
yearly.
	Rent,&c.--The valued rent of Fordoun is L.7129,5s. 4d. Scots.
The real rent, taking into account the rise that will be obtained, in
two or three years, upon the expiry of some leases of fifty-seven years'
duration, will not be less than L.11,420 Sterling; but upon this rental
no great increase can be anticipated for many years.  A moderate
deduction being made from the gross rental for the sheep pasture
in the Grampians, the rent per imperial acre of the arable land
will be about 19s. 6d.
	Few or no cattle or sheep are taken in for grazing by the head,
grass fields being usually taken for that purpose; but the main-
tenance of a cow is estimated to be worth L.6, 10s. yearly, of
which L.3, 10s. may be the proportion for the summer six months.
The summer grazing of an ox or bullock may be L.2, 5s.; and for
the whole year, L.4.  A full-grown sheep may be grazed for the
whole year for 2s. 6d. in the Grampians; but in enclosed lands,
the maintenance for the year will vary from 6s. to 10s.; but if fed
