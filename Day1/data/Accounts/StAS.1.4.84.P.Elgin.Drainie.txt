the subsistence of the poor, at least a third part ot the year.
Agricuture is the chief employment of the people;
yet the moderm improvements in husbandry are only in
their infancy.  Inclosures are yet far from being general.
The introduction of turnips and sown grasses promises to
be of infinite advantage, as proper food for our cattle was
scarce both in summer and winter.  There are in the pa-
rish in all about 96 ploughs; the number of horses is from
300 to 400; the black cattle about double that number;
sheep from 1500 to 2000, and from 20 to 30 swine of
hogs.-The rent of land, when paid in grain, is from a
boll to a boll and a half of bear or oats, Linlithgow measure,
the Scotch acre; but it is the practice here to allow
5 firlots of oats to a boll, being nearly equal to an English
quarter.  Lands, when set for money alone, give from
15 s. to 20 s. and 21 s. the acre.-In some part of this pa-
rish the teind are drawn in kind, that is the tenth shock
or sheaf is carried off the field before the corns are
stacked, and this is commonly reckoned equal to a third
of the rent actually paid.

   Prices, Wages, etc.-The price of bear and oats for
these last 10 years, has not been less than 15 s. the boll, at
an average.  Beef and mutton commonly sell in the Elgin
market from 3 d. to 4 d. the lb. Amsterdam weight; geese
from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s.; hens and ducks from 8 d. to 9 d.
each; eggs 1 1/2 d. the dozen.-The ordinary wages of male
day labourers here, without victuals, are 8 d. in summer, and
of females 4 d.; but both get higher wages in harvest.  Men-
servants employed in husbandry commonly get from L. 5
to L. 8, and women-servants from 30 s. to 40 s. a-year,and
their victuals.  Victual at the Reformation was converted
at half a merk scotch the boll.
