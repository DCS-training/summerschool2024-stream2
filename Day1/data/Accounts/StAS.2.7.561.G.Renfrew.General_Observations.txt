   Means of Conveyance, &c.--The first decided improvement of
the roads in this county took place after the passing of two acts of
Parliament in 1792, the one for converting the statute labour, the
other for making certain new roads. According to Mr Wilson's
estimate, upwards of L. 100,000 had been laid out in this county
upon roads before 1812. The sum is much greater now. As far
back as. 1753, a turnpike act was passed to facilitate the commu-
nication with Glasgow. Afterwards Inchinnan Bridge, an import-
ant undertaking, was built, and the Kilmarnock and Greenock
roads were formed. These remained in an indifferent state of re-
pair till after the above period, 1792. The magistrates of Green-
ock laid out upwards of L. 12,000 in forming the road along the
shore between that town and Kelly Bridge on the confines of Ayr-
shire. But her turnpike roads, once the boast of Renfrewsbire,
are about to be eclipsed by her railways. Of these, there are five
within the county, or immediately connected with it, viz.
   1. The Pollock and Govan Railway was authorized by two acts
passed in 1830 and 1831, with a capital of L. 26,000. Part of
it extends to Rutherglen, and another terminus is at the quay at
Glasgow. It was intended to connect the coalfields in the south-
east of Glasgow with that city.
   2. The Paisley and Renfrew Railway was authorized by an Act
passed in 1835,.with a capital of L.23,000. It forms a direct
communication between Paisley and the River Clyde at Renfrew
Ferry. It is only three miles and a quarter in length. It was
opened in May 1837.
   3. The Glasgow, Paisley, and Greenock Railway was autho-
rized by an Act passed in 1837, with a capital of L.533,333. It
is twenty-two miles and a half in length, from the north end of
Glasfow Bridge to the harbour at Greenock. It passes througIL
Paisley and has a branch to Port-Glargow. It was opened 3lst
March 1841. The joint railway between Glasgow and Paisley,
common with the Glasgow and Ayr Railway, was opened on the
14th of July 1840. The capital has been raised to L.666,666,
for making new branches and other improvements, and erecting a
pier opposite Dumbarton.
