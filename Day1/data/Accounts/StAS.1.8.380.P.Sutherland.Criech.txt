   Shall we state none of the advantages, but those of a pecu-
niary nature?  Is nothing to be let down, for the PLEASURE OF
BEHOLDING THE PROGRESS OF THE PROSPERITY OF A COUNTRY?
Is THE JOY OF SEEING TOWNS AND HOUSES ARISING AROUND
YOU OF NO VALUE?  NOR THE ULTIMATE BENEFIT DERIVED TO
YOUR COUNTRY, BY ADDING TO IT, INDUSTRIOUS INHABITANTS
AND CULTIVATED LAND; THRIVING TOWNS AND FLOURISHING
MANUFACTURES?  IS there no pleasure in beholding the
growth of woods of one's own planting?  nor in the success of
a system, so intimately connected with the HAPPINESS OF PEO-
PLE PLACED BY PROVIDENCE UNDER OUR CARE?  Some have
thought, that it would be a fitter use for the Highlands, to con-
vert them into sheep-walks.  That it might be better for the peo-
ple to cultivate sheep, instead of black cattle, is probably true.
That the sheep is a hardier, and a more useful animal than the
ox, may be true also.  That the increase of rents, by convert-
ing cattle-breeding farms, into sheep-walks, would be more
sudden, than by the system here suggested, is not to be dis-
puted.  But that the estates would ultimately become more
valuable, is by no means to clear a proposition.  Tracks of
land, which have been converted into sheep farms, yield little
more, at an average, than 1 L. Sterling, per 100 acres.  This is
indeed a better rent than before.  But how contemptible must
this rent appear, when compared with an estate occupied by
industrious manufacturers, and abounding in large woods of
the finest fir, birch, and other trees?  It is to be observed too,
that there is a certain incompatibility between sheep, and peo-
ple and trees.  No care can protect new plantations from
the depredations of sheep; they overleap every fence, and
elude the utmost vigilance of the shepherd.  The leaves of
trees are their favourite food in summer; and the bark
is their medicine, as well as food in winter.  The lower
