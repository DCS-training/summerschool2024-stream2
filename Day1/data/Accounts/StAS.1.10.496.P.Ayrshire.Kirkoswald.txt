280 L. Sterling.  A still greater rise has taken place in the
eastern part of the parish towards Maybole.  A farm consist-

now done in that way, and it is to be hoped the time is fast
coming, when this illicit trade will be at an end.  Though
the character and behaviour of those engaged in this business,
were, for the most part, in other respects good; yet, with-

people, and gave them a taste for luxury and finery, that
spoiled the simplicity of manners which formerly prevailed in
this parish.
