   Emigration.-In the year 1774, a few people emigrated
to America.  They left their native country, their rela-
tives, and abounding means of enjoyment, to settle in
woods, among savages and wild beasts.  Many of there de-
luded creatures were rich, and left very profitable leases, to
bemoan their folly in uncultivated deserts.

   Produce.-This parish has grain enough for its inhabi-
tants, and also much for exportation.  In 1782-3 it enjoyed
its usual plenty.
