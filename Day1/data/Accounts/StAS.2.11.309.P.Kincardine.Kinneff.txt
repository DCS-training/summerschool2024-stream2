              I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

        Name.-This parish seems to have derived its name from the
Castle of Kinneff, the remains of which may still be seen in the
neighbourbood of the church. According to a local tradition,
Kenneth, one of the Kings of Scotland, was its founder, and it was
afterwards retained as a royal residence.
        Boundaries.-The parish is nearly triangular in figure, having
for its boundaries, on the south, Bervie; on the east, the German
Ocean; on the north, Dunnottar; and on the west, Arbuthnott.
It extends 5 miles along the sea coast, its breadth at the northern
extremity being about 4, and at the southern less than half a mile.
According to a survey made by Mr Garden in 1774, it contains
6408 English acres.
