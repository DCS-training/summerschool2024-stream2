     of Moy and Dalarossie.

     NUMBER XXX.

     UNITED PARISHES OF MOY AND
     DALAROSSIE.

     (County and Presbytery of Inverness-Synod of Moray.)

     By the Rev. Mr. WILLIAM M'BEAN, late Minister of that
     Parish, and now Minister of ALVES.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE Gaelic is almost the only language used in these
parishes, and has been so, as far back as tradition goes.
The names of all the places in them are evidently of Gaelic
derivation, and descriptive of their situation, or some other
property.  Accordingly, Moy, in Gaelic, Magh, signifies a
meadow or plain, which is the nature of the place; Dalaros-
sie, or Dalfergussie, is Fergus's valley.  The ancient name is
Starsach-na-gal, i. e. the Threshold of the Gaels, or Highlanders,
being the pass, by which the Highlanders entered to the Low
Country, so narrow between high mountains, that a few men
could defend it against numbers.  It was of great consequence
to the proprietor in those times, as he could make inroads in-
to the Low Country, and easily prevent any pursuit beyond
