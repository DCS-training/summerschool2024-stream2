unlikely that many of the tumuli every where visible, mark the
resting-place of individuals slain in some highland foray for cattle
into the lowlands; for which the upper districts were at one time
so famous.  On such occasions, the hills and mountains of this pa-
rish, lying as they do betwixt the north and the south country, must
often have been the scene where the fugitives and the pursuers
encountered each other, and disputed the prize; and these tumuli
would indicate that the encounters did not always pass over without
blood.  This idea derives some probability of truth, from the cir-
cumstance, that there is a mountain pass leading through this pa-
rish, across the Grampians, to the south country, known to this day
by the name of the "Cattrin road," or perhaps "raid,"-a clear
proof that this district was at one time well known to, and fre-
quented by, the "Cattrin," in their excursions from the higher
and more northern districts to and from the south.
   In Spalding's history of the "Troubles of Scotland" occasional
allusion is made to the inhabitants of this parish and district
They seem to have followed the fortunes of the Gordon or the
Huntly family, and, being opposed to the Covenanters, suffered
frequent spoliation of their cattle and property from the soldiers
of the latter.  The same authority records that several of the mi-
nisters of Birse stoutly resisted signing the Covenant, and refused
to yield until high ecclesiastical censures were passed upon them.
   In modern times the chief occurrences connected with the pa-
rish are, 1st, the building of the bridge of Potarch over the Dee,
in 1813, establishing a communication between the parish and the
Deeside turnpike road to Aberdeen; 2dly, the building of a sus-
pension bridge over the same river at the west end of the parish,
by the Earl of Aboyne, first in 1828, and, on its being carried off
by the great flood in August 1829, rebuilding it in 1830; and
3dly, the building of a bridge over the river Feugh, in 1835, on
the line of the great north and south road across the Grampians.
