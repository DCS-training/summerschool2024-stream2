				PARISH OF FARR.

		PRESBYTERY OF TONGUE, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND

				  CAITHNESS.

                       THE REV. DAVID MACKENZIE MINISTER.

		I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	   Name.-THE parish appears to have been called Farr, for more
	than 400 years. The name is probably derived from the Gaelic
	word Faire, a watch or centinel; for, about half a mile north of
	the parish church is the ruin of a circular tower, or Dunn, the
	nearest to the sea-coast of a chain of these ancient buildings, ex-
	tending for more than twenty-four miles into the interior. Not
	far from this Dunn, is the promontory called Farr Head, from
	which, in clear weather, there is a distinct view of that part of the
	northern ocean, which lies betwixt Orkney and Cape Wrath.
	From this promontory, a centinel or watch could easily discover
	vessels approaching the coast, and, during the period of invasions
	from Denmark and Orkney, could speedily communicate the ne-
	cessary intelligence to the inhabitants of the interior, by means of
	the chain of towers, and such signals as were then in use. This,
	however, is only a conjecture as to the name of the parish, found-
	ed on the geographical relation of the place now called Farr to
	Strathnaver, where the principal chain of towers was erected, and
	which strath, in ancient times, was the most populous and most
	interesting part of the parish.
	   Extent and Boundaries.-The parish is about forty English
	miles long, from Baligil in the north-east to Muadale in the south-
	west; and varies from eight to twenty miles in breadth, the nar-
	rowest part being in the middle of Strathnaver. It is bounded
	on the north by the Northern Ocean; on the east, by the parish
	of Reay in Caithness; on the south, by the parishes of Kildonan
	and Lairg; and on the west, by the parish of Tongue. Its figure
	is irregular.
	   Topographical Appearances.-The principal mountain in the
	Parish, and the highest in the county, is Bein Chlibrig. It is near
