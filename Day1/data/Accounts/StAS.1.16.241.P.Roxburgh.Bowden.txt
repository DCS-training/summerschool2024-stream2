towers, the one of 3, the other of 5 stories, consisting of 8
or 10 lodgeable rooms besides porters lodges, servants
hall, vaulted cellars, bakehouses, etc.  The roof and floor-
ing, being all of the strongest oak, if kept in the state in
which they then were, might have stood for a century.
But during the minority of the present Duke, while he
was abroad, without his knowledge, his then commissioner
ordered this building to be mostly pulled down, merely for
the sake of getting the freestone in them to build a large
farm-house and appurtenances, at the distance of 3 miles
though the difficulty of separating these stones from the
lime made them a dear purchase.  Some of the vaults still
remain, and are used by the tenant; and about 160 feet of
the court wall are perfectly entire, which makes the de-
molition of the rest to be much regretted as the whole
building was stately and ornamental to the place, as well as
venerable for its antiquity.  One stone, preserved from the
ruins, and now a lintel to the door of the farm-house at
Holydean, has in the middle an unicorn's head and three
stars, with this inscription on either side:

   About 140 yards from the principal house on the top of
a precipice hanging over a burn, there had been a chapel or

man bones, which have been dug up from time to time.
Hence probably has arisen the name Hoydean or Halie-
dean.
   The greatest curiosity, perhaps, of its kind in Britain, is
a stone dike without lime, which incloses about 500 acres
of this farm, and has stood more than 300 years, yet is still
a tolerable fence.  It has at first been 6 or 7 feet high,
