   The number of poor on the parish-roll is 40, who are
supplied by the weekly collections as often as the fund
admits; but which is quite inadequate to their need.  Such
therefore of them as can go about, receive alms from the
country people; and those who are decrepit or confined to
bed, are, in addition to the surplus received from the ses-
sion, supported by country charity sent to them; for the
people, according to their abilities, are very charitable, and
attentive to real indigence.

   Exports.-Several hundreds of black cattle are annually
exported to Ayrshire; they are bought up by different
persons, and ferried in every month from May to Decem-
ber; so that their number cannot easily be ascertained.  A
considerable quantity of barley is also exported to Greenock,
Saltcoats, Irvine, A yr, and Campbelltown; but 3 licensed
distillers have lately been erected in the island, which will
exhaust a great part of the barley that can henceforth be
spared.  Also kelp is manufactured here, and exported,
perhaps 60 tons in the year.  They also export small quan-
tities of mutton, and linen yarn, by all which commodities,
they are enabled, in addition to industry and œconomy, to
pay their rent, and answer the other exigencies of their
families.  But as the island breeds no horses, the people
are obliged to buy at dear rates, in Argyleshire, and o-
ther places; they also frequently buy sheep for breed in
Ayrshire, as in stormy snowy winters many of their sheep die.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The chief advantages
are good water and pure air; which are counterbalanced by
many disadvantages.  There are in this parish no safe harbours,
by which many real losses are sustained; expense, loss of
time, and sometimes loss of lives and property, attend the
unavoidable necessity of having recourse to extramaritime
