	Land-owners.--There are four principal heritors in this parish:
The Right Honourable the Earl of Stair; Sir Andrew Agnew, Bart.
of Lochnaw; Colonel Vans Agnew, Esq. of Sheuchan; and the
Rev. David Wilson, Stranraer. There are four other proprie-
tors who pay a small part of the stipend. Sir Andrew Agnew is
the principal heritor, and the only residing heritor.

	Modern Buildings.--Lochnaw castle is the only considerble
building in the parish. It is built on an elevated hill, and appears
to have been intended for a place of defence. Towards the south,
traces of a deep fosse may still be seen, and on the north it is de-
fended by a lake. A fine new church was built in 1828, which
contains abott 800 people.

	Agriculture and Rural Economy.--It is impossible to say what
number of acres are under tillage, as the land has not been lea-
sured. It may, however, be state, that a very considerabld quan-
tity of land has of late years been under tillage, which before was
never cultivated. When that coarse land is limed and laid under
summer fallow, eight or ten seeds are generally produced. There
