But the chief beauty of this church is in the inside, which
strikes every spectator when entering from the west.  About
one half of the church on the east end is covered with vault-
ed roofs, commencing with a large semicircular arch, and di-
vided nearly into two equal parts, by a smaller arch farther

mouldings, chiefly in a starry shape:  The small one has a
very elegant enrichment introduced into it, consisting of a

price of wheat being between 23 and 24 s.; of barley between
17 and 18 s.; of meal between 16 and 17 s.; and of oat's be-
tween 14 and 15 s. the boll.  The glebe is between 5 and 6
acres of good soil.  The last presentation was given by the
Earl of Rosebery; against which the late Earl of Hopetoun

cise of that right till the next vacancy.

is not yet known.  Apperances of coal have also lately been
observed on Mr Dundas's estate of Newhalls.  There is whin-
