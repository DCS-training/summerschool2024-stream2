     Statistical Account

   Fisheries.-There is a tolerable good cod fishery in the Irish
channel, which is pursued with various success through the
whole season; but none is exported.  About Lammas, abun-
dance mackerel are taken in the bay of Luce.  The salmon
fishery might be carried on with some success, but has been
very much neglected.

   Reads.-The parish roads, formerly made and repaired,
by statute labour, are now kept in order by a conversion of
15 s. for every L. 100. Scots, of valued rent, payable by the
tenants, pro rata; and each householder, not a tenant, pays
at the rate 1 s. 8 d. per annum.

   Stipend, Schools, etc.-The stipend is L. 640. Scots, in-
cluding L. 40 for furnishing communion elements, 60 bolls of
meal, 32 bolls of bear, Lintithgow measure, with a manse and
glebe.  The patronage of the church lies in the Crown, and
Mr. M'Donald of Garthland, per vices, the former for Clashank
and Toscarton, and the latter for Stonykirk.  There are
two schools in the parish, both in wretched order as to houses;
and the salary only 100 merks.  There may be above 130 scho-
lars at them, for four months in the year, but after the 1 st of
March, the number dwindles down to 20 or thereabouts.  There
are, at present, about 15 poor on the funds; the collection for
their relief, amounts, at an average, only to 7 s 6 d. per week.

   Population.-The population is as follows.
