   Miscellaneous Observations-Spott house, romantically si-
tuated on a rock, in a dean, den, or glen, about a mile long, 
though appearing in a very low site, has a prospect of the 
German ocean, Dunbar, the Bass, Isle of May, and the 
neighbouring very rich coast of East Lothian.  On each 
side of the house there are rivulets, falling in beautiful cas-
cades, over rocks, into very deep pools.  The banks in many 
places are almost perpendicular, covered with very tall 
old plane, ash, elm, and beech trees, many of whole trunks 
and branches are twined about with ivy. There is no space 
between the banks, but what the burn occupies, which 
runs into Spott water, or Brock's-burn, and enter the 
German ocean at Broxmouth, a seat of the Duke of Rox-
burgh near Dunbar.  On the banks of all the burns there 
are excellent springs.  St John's well, in the neighbour-
hood of the village of Spott in the most remarkable; it is 
carried in pipes 2 miles to Dunbar, for the supply of wa-

of the Earl B.) was formerly resorted to for scorbutic com-
plaints.  Spartleton-hill is one of the highest in Lammermuir. 
Downhill, about 500 feet above the sea, is remarkable for 
being the place on which General Leslie had his camp, be-
fore (what is sometimes called) the Battle of Dunbar, but in 
general over this country, the Battle of Dowhill, fought
