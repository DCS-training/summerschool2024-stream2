     Statistical Account

   Manufactures.-The distillery of malt spirits, brewing of
ale, malting, candle making, and iron founding, are the only
manufactures of consequence carried on at Airdrie, as the
weavers and tambourers are chiefly employed by Glasgow
manufacturers.  The distillery is carried on to a considerable
amount, there being about 40,000 gallons of proof spirits
made annually.  It is allowed, by judges, that the malt spi-
rits made at Airdrie are of a peculiar fine quality and flavour;
and although a small quantity only is used here, there is a
constant demand for it from every part of the country, and
some of it is exported to America and the West Indies on
account of its quality.  There are 7 corn mills, 6 lint mills,
and 3 sets of rollers for crushing malt.  The thirlage is no
great hardship here, as the multures are generally small.  On
that account, some proprietors of mills have allowed them
to fall to ruin.

   Character.-Considering the number of the inhabitants,
and the want of magistrates, the morals of the people are
much better than could be expected.  None born in the pa-
rish have ever suffered either corporal or capital punish-
ment.  The people, in general, are hospitable and sober.
Dissipation is only to be found among a few of the lower
rank.  They attend church regularly, and are generally very
clean and well dressed.  As every person, who chooses to
work, finds employment, the trades people, in general, are in
easy circumstances, and appear to be contented, Almost
every tradesman is proprietor of a house and garden, which
gives them a natural attachment to the place.  The people
of Airdrie seem to have a peculiar foible of keeping a great
number of useless dogs, which are a nuisance to every pas-
senger, and plainly points out the propriety of a tax being
laid on these animals.
