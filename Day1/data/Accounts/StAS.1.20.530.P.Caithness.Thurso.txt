     CHAP. XIV. ARTS AND SCIENCES.

   Under this branch, all that can be looked for in these
hints, is, to enumerate the number of persons, of each profes-

   SECT. I. Law.-There are a greater number of limbs of
the law in Thurso, thanin many places of much greater extent.
There are no fewer than eight public notaries, five of whom

this profession, would be fully adequate to the business both
in town and country; and that the spirit of litigation, for
which the people of Caithness were too long distinguished,
in the records of the courts of law, is now happily begin-
ning to subside.

   SECT. II. Physic.-There are now three surgeons set-

situation requires them to be; for, in the winter seasons, the
practice of Caithness is peculiarly trying to the constitution
of this class of the community.  These are the only medical
persons in the country who have received a regular educa-
tion.

   SECT. III. Divinity.-There is but one clergyman of
the Established Church in Thurso.
   There is a seceder chapel in town, but it is at present va-

was an inoffensive and well-meaning man.
   The followers of Messrs Haldane and Aikman, are col-
lecting subscriptions for building a Kirk of Relief, and pro-
viding a stipend for a minister, from amongthe Missionarian
