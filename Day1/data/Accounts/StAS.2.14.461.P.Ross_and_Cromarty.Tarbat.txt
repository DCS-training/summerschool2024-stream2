   The castle of Balone is a most ancient building, and perhaps
the largest and the most entire now standing in Ross-shire. It is
said to have been built by the Earls of Ross. But the last inhabitants
were the Earls of Cromarty, and Alexander Mackenzie of
Ardloch Assint, brother to the late Earl George Mackenzie of
Cromarty. It has not been inhabited by any respectable family
for 200 years.
   Fragments of what is said to have been a Danish cross are top
be seen scattered among the graves in the church-yard; and a
low green mound, adjoining the eastern gable of the church, is
still pointed out as the site on which it stood.
   Several chests, composed of rough freestone flags, were dug up a
few years ago, at a place in the neighbourhood of Portmaholmack,
by labourers employed in levelling the ground for new buildings.
Each chest contained an entire skeleton, of a size unusually large,
and, from the position of the bones, it appeared that the bodies had
been doubled. A number of small copper coins, all of Charles I.,
together with a lady's ring, encircled with the inscription, Finish my
desire, rudely executed, were discovered about twenty years ago
in a garden near Balone Castle. The ring is now in the possession
of George Mackenzie Ross, Esq. of Aldie, and is said to
be of considerable value.
   Parochial Registers.-The only parochial registers extant are,
a book in which the minutes of the kirk-session are kept, and
another in which births and marriages are recorded. The earliest
entry in the first is in the year 1750, and in the second, 1801.
These books have been regularly kept.
