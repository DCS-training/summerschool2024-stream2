sown on an acre, usually return about 200 stones of hay.
The carse farmers usually confine themselves to one crop of
grass.

   Seed-time, etc.-Beans are sown about the beginning of
March; oats about the latter end of March; barley about
the latter end of April; wheat some time before or about
the first of November.
   Harvest usually begins about the middle of August, and
ends about the last of September.
   The cultivation of the dryfield lands is somewhat different
from the cultivation of the carses.  The succession of crops
in the dryfield is commonly in the following order: Oats two
years, barley one year, grass one year, pasture two years.
Where the ground is very good, peas and beans instead
of oats are sometimes sown in the second year of the ro-
tation.
   Land preparing for oats, peas or beans, is ploughed once.
Ground for barley twice.  Grasses are usually sown with the
barley.
   Lime is laid on the dryfield lands in the month of August,
immediately after the grass crop is cut.  It is not ploughed
down.  Seven chalders are allowed to an acre.  Dung is laid
on the ground, preparing for barley; sixty carts drawn by one
horse, are allowed to an acre.  When beans and peas are
sown, the dung is laid upon the ground preparing for them.
Neither more nor other manure is almost ever used during
one rotation of six years.  There is marle in the parish, but
the use of it has of late been almost entirely discontinued.
   Five firlots of oats sown on an acre, return seven bolls.
