are to be seen in the castle of Glammiss.

   Antiquities.-Within a few yards of the manse of Glam-
miss, there is an obelisk, of rude design, erected, as is gene-
rally supposed, in memory of the murder of Malcolm II.
King of Scotland.  On one side of the monument, there are
figures of two men, who, by their attitudes, seem, to be
forming the bloody conspricacy.  A lion and a centaur, on
the upper part, represent the shocking barbarity of the crime.
On the reverse, several sorts of fishes are engraven, as a sym-
bolical representation of the lake, in which, by missing their
way, the assassins were drowned.  In a neighbouring field, there
is a stone on which are delineated a variety of symbolical cha-
racters similar to those already mentioned, and intended, as is
supposed, to express the same facts.  At the distance of one
mile from Glammiss, near a place called Coffans, there is an
obelisk, not less curious than either of the two preceding
monuments.  It is vulgarly  called St Orland's Stone.  No
probable conjecture has been formed relating to the facts de-
signed to have been perpetuated by it.  On one side is a cross
rudely flowered and chequered; on the other, four men on
horseback appear to tbe making the utmost despatch.  One
of the horses is trampling under foot a wild boar; and, on
the lower part of the stone, there is the figure of an animal
somewhat like a dragon.  It has been thought that these
symbols represent officers of justice in pursuit of Malcolm's
murderers.  There is fortification on the summit of a hill,
two miles south-west from Glammiss, known by the name of
Denoon Castle.  It probably was designed for a place of re-
treat in times of danger.  It is encompassed by a wall, suppo-
sed to have been 27 feet high, and 30 broad.  There are
two entries, one to the south-east, and another to the north-
