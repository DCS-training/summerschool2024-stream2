Angus.  They first attacked the castle of Brechin, and as
they could make no impression upon it, they wrecked their
vengeance by laying the city and church of Brechin in ashes.
   In the month of March 1645, the Marquis of Montrose,
once a zealous covenanter, and afterwards as zealous a royal-
ist, came to Fettercairn in his return from the north, where
he had, in contradiction to his late solemn engagements, been
promoting the interests of the king.  He was on his way to
Brechin: and as a savage and brutal cruelty had always mark-

covenanter and a royalist, the citizens of Brechin, alarmed at
his approach, left their houses and habitations, and deposited
their effects in the castle and church.  This so enraged the
Marquis, that he allowed his soldiers to plunder the town,
and in the height of their fury they burnt sixty houses to the
ground.  Some of these houses were to the north, but the
most of them to the west.  It seems, before this period, the
houses and buildings here had extended mostly to the west.

   In the year 1781, a very commodious Mason-Lodge was
built by the society of Free-Masons in Brechin, at their own
expence.  Here the master and different members of that re-

   In the year 1789, a very elegant town-house was built,
with a secure and strong prison adjoining, at the expence of
the town, assisted by liberal contributions from several gen-

   A very commodious gardener's lodge was built in the year
1791; and some years ago several gentlemen have built, at
the end of the west wynd, very elegant and commodious hou-
ses for the accommodation of themselves and families: so
