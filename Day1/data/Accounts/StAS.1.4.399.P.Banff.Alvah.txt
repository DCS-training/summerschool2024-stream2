means.  It is commonly exacted in kind; but when com-
mutations in money are more convenient for the people,
they are accepted.  Of late years, bridges have been built
over the most dangerous passes, to the great accommoda-
tion and safety of travellers; and it is hoped, that, as soon
as the funds can afford, more will be erected.  Turnpikes
are unknown in this corner of the country, and would 
undoubtedly be unacceptalbe at first; though the expe-
rience of their advantages might in time reconcile us.  It
must indeed be allowed, that, as the resort on our roads is
but little, they are not so necessary as on those that are
more frequented.

   Antiquities.-There are few or no antiquities in this
parish worthy of a place in historical records.  At the 
farm of Bog of Mountblairie are the remains of an old
castle, situated in a swamp now overgrown with alder, and
said to have been built by the Earl of Buchan; and on an
eminence above it, the ruins of a chapel, adjoining to
which is a well, famed of old for its sovereign charms,
but now fallen into distrepute.  Within these few years
there was an iron laddle; and many still alive remember
to have seen the impending boughs adorned with rags of
linen and woollen garments, and the cistern enriched
with farthings and boddles, the offerings and testimonies of
grateful votaries, who came from afar to this fountain of
health.  At the foot of the hill of Alvah, towards the
north is another spring which passes by the name of
Coms's or Colm's well, in honour, very probably, of the re-
nowned Saint of Icolumkil.
