The population of this parish was, in 1755,                           1037

                                      1832,      493          496      989

   In the census of 1841, the population is stated to be 2147. This
extraordinary increased arose from the residence of about 1100 la-
borers during the formation of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Rail-
way.
   From the record of baptisms, it would appear that the permanent
population was more numerous in the close of the seventeenth cen-
tury than at any subsequent period; the annual average of births
for ten years being then about 39, whereas, for the ten years pre-
ceding 1792, it hardly reached 20, and is now but about 28
Probably the obliteration of several farms, in order to form the
parks and ornamental ground in the, vicinity of Hometown House,
may explain the decrease.

   There is no natural wood, but the extensive plantations, covering
nearly one-sixth of the whole surface, abound in all varieties of
well-thriven trees. Much attention has in general been paid to
thinning and pruning, and the surrounding fences are kept in ex-
cellent repair. The rent of land in cultivation varies from L. 1,
