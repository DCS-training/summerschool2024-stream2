very equitable. After ascertaining how many bolls a Scots acre
will produce, the proportion to be paid as rent is found by divid-
ing the produce of an acre by 20. Thus four boll land will pay
.2 = two-tenths, or .2 = one-fifth of the produce, five boll land,
.25, or one-quarter of the produce for rent. A table may be
thus formed for the rents of lands:

<TABLE>
       Produce     Prop. of prn-   Prod. x prop.    Rent per ac.    Money rent at
       per acre    duce for rent     for rent.      in bolls oats.   15s per boll.
       4 bolls        4/20  = .2        4 x .2   =      0.8   15s.  =   L.0  12  0
       5 do.          5/20  = .25       5 x .25  =      1.25  do.   =     0  18  9
       6 do.          6/20  = .3        6 x .3   =      1.8   do.   =     1   7  0
       7 do.          7/20  = .35       7 x .35  =      2.45  do.   =     1  16  9
       8 do.          8/20  = .4        8 x .4   =      3.2   do.   =     2   8  0
       9 do.          9/20  = .45       9 x .45  =      4.05  do.   =     3   0  9
      10 do.         10/20  = .5       10 x .5   =      5.    do.   =     3  15  0

   It is thus seen that the rent increases as the square of the pro-
duce; so that land that produces twice the number of bolls per
acre that another does, is worth four times the rent: and if eight boll
land be worth L.2, 8s. per acre, six boll land is worth L.1, 7s., be-
ing as 8 2: 6 2, or as 64: 36:: 48s.: 27s. There is as much
required for seed and labour of bad land as of good, although
there is less loss from the failure of a crop; therefore the tenant
requires a greater proportion of the produce of bad than of good
land, to repay him for seed and labour, and consequently leaves a
less proportion for rent; and when land produces only what will
pay for seed and labour, it is worth nothing as cultivated land,
and must be either pastured or planted, or allowed to lie waste.
   Agricultural Improvements.-Upwards of 50 acres of good land
have been trenched, and brought under cultivation on the hills of
Baldowrie by the proprietor. The wet lands on the different
estates have been drained.
   The different kinds of live-stock have lately been much improv-
ed. The kind of cattle consists mostly of the Angus or polled
breed, Teeswater or short-horned, with a few of the Ayrshire
breed and crosses. The sheep grazed on the cultivated lands are
mostly the Leicesters, on the South Downs, with crosses; but the
black-faced Highland breed are brought in to assist in eating off
the turnips in winter. Hugh Watson, Esq. an extensive farmer
in this district, has been long famed as a breeder, particularly of
the Angus breed. There are local Associations in the district for
encouraging these improvements, by giving premiums for the best
stock.
   An Association was formed for improving agriculture, so far
back as 1757, consisting of most of the landed proprietors in the
district, and some at a distance.
