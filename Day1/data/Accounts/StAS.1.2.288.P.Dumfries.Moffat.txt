tiges of that road, and of some military stations near it, are
still visible.  Some large Roman encampments; also, can be
distinctly traced in the neighbourhood.  A piece of gold was
found, a few years ago, in a moss not far from the road, part
of some military ornament, marked with the number of the
legion to which it belonged.
   There are vestiges of an encampment, supposed to be Bri-
tish, near Moffat water, three miles south-east of the village.
   There is a most of considerable height, of a conical form,
with a deep ditch round it, near the road which leads from
Moffat to the well;-a beautiful object from that road at pre-

other smaller moat stands at the distance of a few hundred
yards west from it.
   A mile east of the Roman road, and not far from one of the
Roman encampments, are two caves, cut out of a freestone
rock, fit to contain a number of cattle.  But, when formed, or

tered glen; and were probably made for shelter in trouble-
some times.  They serve at present for offices to the farm-
house placed near them.
   There are ruins of many old towers in different parts of the
parish.  None of them appear to have been large.  They have
been built with lime made of sea shells.  They have probably
been designed as places of security, against the invasions of the
borderers, or retreats for the inhabitants, when returning from
their own predatory excursions.

   Mountains-The highest mountain in the parish, and
perhaps south of Forth, is Hartfell.  Its altitude was taken,
with great care and accuracy, by Dr Walker, professor of na-
tural history in the university of Edinburgh.  It is within a
