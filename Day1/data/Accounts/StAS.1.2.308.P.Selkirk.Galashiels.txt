half of them, at least, escaped the infection, and very few of
the other half died.  Inoculation is gradually gaining ground.
Perhaps the mildness of the natural small-box, makes its pro-
gress flower, than it otherwise might be.  Agues, and flow
fevers are the most prevalent diseases; rheumatisms piles
are not unfrequent.  Fluxes and dysenteries sometimes make
their appearance.  But the far greater number of deaths is oc-
cationed unquestionably by severe labour, and want of proper
attention to cleanliness, diet, and health.

   Manufacture of Woollen Cloth.-The manufacture of coarse
woollen cloth is here carried on to great extent.  It has rapid-
ly increased within these few years, and is now brought to
great perfection.  From Midsummer 1774, to Midsummer
1775, only 722 stones of wool were manufactured into cloth
by the clothiers, and scarcely as much more could be made by
private persons; whereas, in the current season (1790) 243
packs of wool, (each pack containing 12 ft. of 24 lib. English)
have been purchased by the manufactures; besides which,
they receive from different quarters, wool, yarn, and weaved
cloth, to a considerable amount, to be dyed and dressed for
private use, or for sale.  The highest price given, per stone,
for wool, this season, is 19 s, and the lowest 7 s 9 d; but in
general, the quantity purchased is of that fineness, as to raise
the average price to 15 s per stone.  The wool, being bought
in fleeces, as it comes from the sheep, must be afforted, scou-
red, and freed from refuse, in which process, it loses at least
one-fourth of its weight.  A stone of the finest of it, weighed
after being thus prepared, will yield 32 slips of yarn, each
containing 12 cuts, and each cut being 120 rounds of the le-
gal reel.  Of this yarn, 1300 threads is the greatest number
put into the breadth or warp of any web, which, when finish-
ed, exceeds seven-eights of a yard in breadth, and fetches in
