     NUMBER XLIV.

     PARISH OF OLD CUMNOCK.

     (COUNTY AND PRESBYTERY OF AIR, SYNOD OF
     GLASGOW AND AIR.)

     By the Rev. THOMAS MILLER, D. I).

     Soil, Climate, etc.

   THE parish of Old Cumnock, from which that of New
Cumnock was disjoined early in this century is of
an oblong figure, partly slat, and partly hilly.-The soil in
general is clayey, and at the bottom, a strong till.  Part of
it mossy; all the holms are of a light dry soil, formed of sand
and gravel.-The air in general, as through all this higher
part of the country, is moist, but not unhealthy, as may be
collected from the number of aged persons, and from there be-
ing no prevalent distempers.  An aversion to inoculation pre-
vails here, and has not yet been removed by all the pains made
use of; in consequence of this the small-pox occasionaly makes
havock among the children.  But this must gradually lessen, as
inoculation gains ground, though slowly, every year.
