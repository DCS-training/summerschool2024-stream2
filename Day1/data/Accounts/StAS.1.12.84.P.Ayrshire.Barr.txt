who must, from her own account, be above 90; she remem-

fection.  Carrick produces, perhaps, as handsome black cattle
as any part of Scotland; but not the dulce only, but the utile
is to be taken into consideration.  It is a fact, founded upon
repeated experiment, that the handsome Carrick cattle are
much easier fed, and at much less expense, than the cross made
book-boned cattle of like size; that pasture which can bring
