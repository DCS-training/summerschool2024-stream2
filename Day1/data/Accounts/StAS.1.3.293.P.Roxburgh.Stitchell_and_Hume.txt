     of Stitchel and Hume.

news brought on her labour pains, and she was immediately
delivered of a child, upon a hill, ever since called Queen's-
cairn.  In one of the farms belonging to Sir James Pringle,
in the parish of Hume, called Hardie's Mill Place, is a loch
of about 30 acres, in which peats have formerly been got,
but, in a dry summer,cattle can feed all over it; to north
of the loch, about 200 yards distance, is a rising ground, called
Lurgie Craig's, which consist of regular ranges of whin
stones, familar, but not near so large, to those in Arthur's
seat, on the foot path to Duddington from Edinburgh.
They are regular polygons of about five six feet high,
and 16 or 17 inches over; they stand erect and close, but not
adhering to each other, so that a man with a crow can easily
seperate them.  They have all the appearance of being the
same with those the Giants Caufeway in Ireland, of in
some of the Western Island of Scotland.  In another of
these farms, belonging to Sir James Pringle, viz.  Hume-
Byres, is a bill, called Hume Pallat, about a mile from the
castle, and nearly on level with it; upon the west end of
the hill, are the distinct remains of a fort with a fosse; whe-
ther formerly an appendage of Hume Castle, or not, cannot
now be known.

   Miscellaneuos Observations.-The water of Eden seperates
the parish of Stitchel from that of Nenthorn, for about a mile
and a half.  In this course it falls over a rock, nearly per-
pendicular, of about 40 feet high.  in flood, or in a hard
frost, it is a most beautiful object.  The rock is at a small
disrnce fron Newron-Don House. End are no manufac-
turers in the parish.  Lime and coals are brought from the
English side, and are exceedingly dear.  The procuring
fuel is one of the greatest hardships that the parish lies un-
der.  Coal are carried near 20 miles, and any peats that
are used,  are driven about seven. The poorer peopke, there-
fore, have but a very scanty supply of fuel.
