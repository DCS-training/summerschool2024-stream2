but, (60 lbs.) said to be a peculiar favourite with the Jews; mullet,
sperlins, John Dorys, one of the most elegant of the finny tribe, the
gurnard or crooner, so named, from its emitting a sound at the depth
of several feet, similar to the grunting of a pig, the braise, of sin-
gular beauty of colour, (2 lbs.) grim iris, the bones of which, when
boiled, become quite green, and several years ago, a tunny, of about
eight feet in length, was entangled in the salmon nets; or rather was
entrapped out of his depth at the head of the Gareloch.
   The shell fish of any value are few. Occasionally a crab or
lobster is found on the Loch Long shore. Mussels are numerous,
but seldom come to maturity; there is a bed or two of oysters, also
of excellent quality, but scantily inhabited.
   The following, is a list of Roseneath shells, or shells on the
Gareloch shore, two or three of which may be interesting to con-

chologists.
Patella vulgaris                Modiola vulgaris          Venus gallina
Turbo littoreus                 Mytilus edulis            Venerupis pullastra
Turbo rudis                     Cardium edule             Venerupis Virginea
Nerita littoralis               Cardium echinatum         Pholas dactylus
Tornatella tornatilis           Tellina tenuis            Hiatella rugosa
Buccinum undatum                Psammobia solidula        Mya arenaria
Rostellaria pes-pelecani        Astarte Scotica           Mya truncata.

   Botany.--Tbe soil seems favourable for the growth of trees of
all descriptions; and evergreens, shy, or rather difficult of culture,
shoot up in the more sheltered spots with wonderful celerity and
luxuriance There are in the woods of Campsail, as well as in
the policies contiguous to the Castle, and around the church, trees
of great magnitude and beauty. But the botanic glory of the pa-
rish, are the two silver firs near the site of the old mansion of
the Campbells of Carrick. They are supposed to have been
among the first specimens, and coeval with the introduction of
that species of pine into this country. Their circumference, five
feet from the ground, is about 19 feet, and their lofty stems support
a profusion of mighty boughs, by the -peculiar form and grouping
of which, such an expression of power and majesty is conveyed, as
to excite, even in the most insensible, sublime emotions. They
singularly combine, by their relative position, to effect this. A
distinguished artist greatly erred, when preparing his work on fo-
rest, trees; he sketched only one of these magnificent forms. Would
a section of York Minster do justice to that noble pile in a collec-
tion of Gothic cathedrals?
