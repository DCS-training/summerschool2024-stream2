     Statistical Account

   There has been a great alteration in the style of building
churches in the Synod of Aberdeen since its erection, but
without attending to the strict proportion and simplicity of
this plan, which might serve as a model for any church,
the pulpit being placed at an equal distance from the east
and west end of the north wall, and every person both see-
ing and hearing the minister.  The whole expence of the
building was only L. 520 Sterling; and a small fund being
obtained, by the rent of a few seats, which were fixed after
the plan was completed, at present under the management
of the kirk-session, the heritors have paid nothing for re-
pairs ever since the church was built.
   The Scotch and English Episcopals and Seceders have
each a very convenient place of worship in the town of
Peterhead.  There is an organ in each of the Episcopal
chapels.

   Poor.-There are no assessments on the heritors for the
subsistence of the poor.  They are supported chiefly from
collections in the church, which are very liberal.  When
I was settled in 1763, there was about L. 90 Sterling
in the box; the money at present settled on interest does
not much exceed that sum.  Thirty years ago, ordinary
collections every Lord's day were from 7 s. to 8 s.; they
are now from 18 s. to L. 1.  This, with the ordinary per-
quisites, under the management of the kirk-session, and the
interest of a small capital, affords considerable relief to the
poor, who for some years have varied from 70 to 80.
There are few beggars in the parish, excepting on Friday,
on which there is always a market in the town of Peter-
head: many on that day come in from the neighbouring
parishes.  At the communion, which is dispensed once
every year, there is collected from L. 16 to L. 17 Sterling.
A collection of L. 5 Sterling is sent each year to the In-
