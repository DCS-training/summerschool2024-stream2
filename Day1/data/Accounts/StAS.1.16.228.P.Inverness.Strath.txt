kets for both, it would undoubtedly spur on the tenants to
industry.  Would not the bounties and premiums (exclu-
sive of the fish) be of essential benefit to the Highlands, if
the inhabitants could obtain them?  Would not the money
thus acquired be in part, at least, laid out in improving the
country?  Peat is the only fuel used here; a great part of
the summer is wasted in digging and leading them home.
The roads through the parish are very indifferent.  There
is but one inn in the parish, yet whisky, brought from
Ferrintosh, is sold by the bottle in many places.  If this
pratice is tolerated, there is danger that the people be-

and a barrel of herring has sold fresh for 2 s. which, if
salted, would have sold for 12 s.  Some waste lands have

straw, and the flame and heat parches the grain; it is then
made into meal on the quern.  This meal looks very black,
but tastes well enough, and is esteemed very wholesome.
The whole of the work is performed by the women.  The
