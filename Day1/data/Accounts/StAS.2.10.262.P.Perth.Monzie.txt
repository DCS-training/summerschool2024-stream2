                  PARISH OF MONZIE. *

      PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH & STIRLING.

            THE REV. JOHN REID OMOND, MINISTER.


        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-MONZIE is derived from the Gaelic, Moighidh, and
signifies a level tract.
   Figure.-The parish, though extremel irregular in its outline,
and not reducible to any known figure in mathematics, neverthe-
less approaches more nearly to the form of the parallelogram than
any other,-being intersected throughout its entire length by the
river Almond.
   Boundaries and Extent.-It is bounded on the north by Dull,
Weem, and Kenmore; on the east by Fowlis; on the south by
Crieff; and on the west by Monivaird and Comrie.  It extends
about 12 miles along the course of the Almond, and its greatest
breadth is estimated at 7.
   Topographical Appearances.-Situated within the limits of the
Gr`mpians, it presents a wearisome succession of hills, seldom
trodden by the foot of man; but, to compensate for this mono-
tony, it contains two valleys, Glenalmond and the Vale of Mon-
zie,-the only habitable parts of the parish,-both of which pos-
sess no small degree of attraction to the admirers of natural beauty.
   Vale of Monzie.-The vale of Monzie commences at the south-
ern boundary of the parish, and extends about five miles in a di-
rection north-east, with a rise of several hundred feet, where it
unites with Glenalmond, at nearly right angles.  It is watered for
about three miles by the Shaggie. The upper part of this small
stream,-tbe lofty banks of which are covered with luxuriant copse-
wood,-is rendered picturesque by three waterfalls, one Of them
55 feet in height.  At that point where the wood terminates, the
banks suddenly widen, giving place to a pretty extensive plain.
Here stand the parish church, the hamlet, and at some distance
