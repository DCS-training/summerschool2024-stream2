	Scotlandand is greatly set off by its fine large play-ground, which
	has been of late tastefully planted, walled in, and railed. The new
	church is a substantial, but rather heavy-looking editice; a tower
	is its great desideratum.  There was erected in 1825, a handsome
	town and county house, close to the antique five spired prison-
	tower, which forms the most prominent object in the town : unfor-
	tunately, it was not constructed fire-proof; and the upper rooms,
	being appropriated for the confinement of debtors, were, a few years
	ago, by some accident, inflamed. Several lives were lost, and the
	building was almost burnt to the ground. It has not since been re-
	built, and what was once an ornament, is now the greatest defor-
	mity in the place.

        <TABLE POPULATION>

        	The population in 1755 was 1870
				  1811	   2384
				  1821	   2861
				  1881	   3078
				  1836     2915; males, 1299; females, 1616.

	  The decrease during the last five years may be ascribed in part
	to the ravages of cholera in the village of Inver, where above a
	third of the inhabitants were swept off in a few weeks; and partly
	to emigration; while some diminution of trade is thought, besides,
	to have taken place in the town, in consequence of the non-resi-
	dence at present of many of the neighbouring proprietors, and per-
	haps, too, from the number of shops recently opened in the sur-
	rounding villages. However occasioned, it ascertain that the value of
	houses in the town has, within the last few years, fallen nearly a half.
