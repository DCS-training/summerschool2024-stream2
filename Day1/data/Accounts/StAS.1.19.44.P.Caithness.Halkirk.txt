to oral tradition, hoping to find access by that quarter.
Alas! tradition is too much the work of fancy.  Like Ho-
mer's Iliad, it may amuse as a pleasant dream, but can give
him as little authenticated information of the truth, as that
poem can give of ancient Troy, and the siege of it, which
I suppose was as confused a story in that poet's time; as
that of these antiquities, and gave equal play and scope to
the imagination.  Where now will the antiquarian turn

he may find something like the object of his enquiry and
wish; but it is too vague and general, too much clothed

I will attempt it, at all adventures, and do what I can.

events, which would amply reward the memory, of the hi-
storian, had they not escaped his notice.  I myself, this mo-
ment, when I am at a loss for information, could I but find
a proper historian on the subject, would have said, Peace to

be happy if any correct me with the light of authenticity
and truth.

   Ecclesiastical Antiquities,-claim my attention, in the
first place.  Among these, the religious house that was at
Spittal is the most distinguished.  This house, it is certain,
was originally founded and endowed by a St Magnus of
