mellington was a Roman station; the Corda which Dr Henry sets
down upon the Ayr at Cumnock. The Gaelic etymology of the
name agrees also entirely with the appearance of the place, cor-
responding to the first portion of its modern appellation.
	There have been three considerable cairns or heaps of loose
stones in the parish, all above the village. One oftbese immense
heaps, about half a mile to the east-south-east, on the top of a little hill,
measured about ll5 yards in circumference. The materials of it were,
a few years ago, applied by the present occupant of the land to the
more useful purpose of building dikes. There were found under
it several graves covered with flat stones, and containing dry hu-
man bones. Sometime before, another about a mile from it, in a
valley, was applied to the same purpose. Under it also were found
graves and bones. Some remains of a third, called the White Cairn
of Carnannock, have been left in the middle of the moor, about
half a mile from the head of the parish, and as far to the south-
west of the Galloway road. It is said to mark the spot where the
chiefs of one party were buried, after some severe conflict of ancient
days; and tradition farther says the slain of the opposite party were
buried under a similar cairn, some miles farther on, in the farm of
Holm, in the parish of Carsphairn.
