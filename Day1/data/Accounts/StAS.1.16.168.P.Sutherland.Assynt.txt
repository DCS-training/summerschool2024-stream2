live in peace, and exchange mutual good offices; their yell
cattle graze in common only for about three months in
the year, on those very high and bleak summits.  Quitting
marches with Edrachilish as above, this parish, at the very
same Cloich-an-tnive, begins to bound with the most re-
mote Highland grazings*, now of the parish of Creech,
and since 1732 a property of the Balnagown family.
From Cloich-an-tnive the present runs thus:  By the
heights of Lead-ri-voch; by Tu-on; by Maul an-fear-loch;
the heights of Lead-na-bea-kach, until you arrive at the Ca
(i. e. the slap or pass) of that hill; the pass lies betwixt
Be-a-kich and Gone-vaul-hill, the latter still belongs to this
parish; the march is continued by a burn, which descends
from the pass betwixt these two very high hills last
mentioned; at the distance of a mile from its source, it
forms a loch called Du-loch-more+, the stream issuing
from it at the distance of about half a mile, falls along a
precipice; here the march forms a curve to Fowran-bal-
lach-tra-li-gal++; this spring is situated on the verge of the
same precipice, southward of the above stream; its pure ri-
vulet glides along a similar course, both to Stra-an-an, now

<FOOTNOTE>

*These grazings are, Kor-a-vad-ag-beg, Kor-a. vad-ag-more, Beak-
ach-hill and Stra-an-an.  Contests had arisen betwixt the herds of the
Laird of Assint and those of Balnagown.  The Sheriff-depute of the
Right Honourable the Earl of Sutherland, who then, as of old, held heri-
table jurisdiction of the whole county, necessarily interfered; and think-
ing, that by the situation of these places, they should be attached to Bal-
nagown's neighbouring property, they were accordingly made over, by
which Assint lost what of old was reckoned grazing belonging to it.

tra-li-gal.
