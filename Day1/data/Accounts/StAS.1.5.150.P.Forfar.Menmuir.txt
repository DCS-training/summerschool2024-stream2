ges of artisans vary much:  Some carpenters will be got for
3 d. a-day, others can hardly be hired for 1 s. 6 d.  The
case is similar with regard to tailors.  Some of them only
demand 4 d. and other 8 d. a-day, just as they happen to be

   Poor.-There are 10 at present on the funds.  The an-

   Church.-The church was built in 1767.  The stipend

The patron is John Eriskine, Esq; of Dun.

and in winter the greatest number never exceed 30.  The
encouragement given to the master is extremely poor.  A
paltry house, about 100 merks of salary, and the emolu-

   Antiquities.-On the top of a hill call Catertbun,

consists of an immense quantity of loose stones, ranged
round the summit of the mountain in an elliptic form.
Whether these are the ruins for a stupenduons wall, or whe-
