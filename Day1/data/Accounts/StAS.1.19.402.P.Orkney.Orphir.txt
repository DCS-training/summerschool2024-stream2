   Hills.-The principal hill in this parish is about 700
feet high.  It is called the Wart Hill, as is erroneously sup-
posed, from a small hillock raised on the top of it by Mr
Murdoch Mackenzie, when he surveyed these islands.  This
gentleman, who is still alive, is a native of Orkney; and
the first who brought surveying to that degree of accuracy
which it has of late attained.  Sir Robert Strange, the late
famous engraver, was also a native of this country; and,
as he told the present incumbent, passed some of the hap-

manse of Orphir, are to be seen, at one view, 25 islands
and 23 parishes, including most of the Orkney islands, and
part of the island of Great Britain, with an extensive view
of the Atlantic and Germanic Oceans, together with that
truly sublime object, the stupenduous mountain of Hoy,
washed on one side by the Pentland Firth, and on the other
by the Orkney Mediterranean, which is as beautiful a piece
of water as any country in Scotland can boast of, and much
frequented by shipping.  The Lord Advocate of Scotland,
upon a late visit to these islands, arriving at this enchanted
spot, from whence he first beheld the Atlantic Ocean, is
said to have exclaimed with ecstacy, "Happy is the cler-
