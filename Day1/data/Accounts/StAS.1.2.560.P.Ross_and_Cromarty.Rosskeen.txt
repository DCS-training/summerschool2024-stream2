     Statistical Account

that some skilful farmer of spirit, from those districts where
marle is much used, did not take some of the capital farms
in this neighbourhood.  While he enriched himself, he
might teach others how to add considerably to the means of
their subsistence, and to the improvement of their country.

   Population.-The population of the parish, as returned to
Dr Webster in 1755, was 1958 souls.  There are now in it
1400 examinable persons above, and 300 under 6 years of
age.  The births are, at an average, from 40 to 50 per annum.
No accurate account of deaths and marriages can be given.
The number of inhabitants has of late been much increased, by
a species of cottagers, here called meallers, who build a small
house for themselves, on a waste spot of ground, with the con-
sent of the proprietor, and there, are ready to hire themselves
out as day-labourers.  At their spare hours, they trench and
improve small bits of the muir around them, which they first
plant with potatoes, and afterwards sow with grain.  Though
their improvements, taken individually, are trisling and slow, yet
in the aggregate, they amount, in a course of years, to something
considerable.  They pay hardly any consideration to the land-
lord, during the life of the first settler. But, upon the whole,
it is observed, that from their labour, and the industry of
their wivse and children, they live more comfortably, than
those in a supposed superior class, and enjoy perfect indepen-
dence.

   Rents.-Lands in general are let in this parish, from 10 s
to 12 s. per acre, of arable, though, on some situations, near
the shore, they draw from 15 s. to 20 s. and 21 s.  In the heights
of the parish, the value is not ascertained by the acre, but by
the joint judgement of the tenant and landlord.
