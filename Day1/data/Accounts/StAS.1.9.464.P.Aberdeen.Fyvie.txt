     Statistical Account

the education of youth is at present carried on at this
school on the most approved plan; and besides what is ge-
nerally taught at grammar schools, the French and English
languages are taught here with as much purity and exact-
ness as in most of the English academies, (the present ma-

in the neighbourhood of London), a circumstance which
deserves to be remarked, as few country parishes enjoy the

Fyvie, not far from the church.

it into hose.  The hose manufacturers in Aberdeen come out
to different stations every 4 weeks, and give out their wool,
which they receive knit into stockings.  Thus, the work-
ers are not put to the trouble and expense of providing

also employ themselves in the winter evenings, in knitting
their own stockings.  A much better way of employing
their time than frequenting the ale-house, of which there
are only 3 in the parish.
   Miscellaneous Articles.-There are in the parish 13 corn-

turned by the machinery of the mill, which not only faci-
