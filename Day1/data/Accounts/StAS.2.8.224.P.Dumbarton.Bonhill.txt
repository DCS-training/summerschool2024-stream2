   The first printfield on the Leven was begun about the year
1768. At first the printing was almost entirely confined to hand-

the parish had acquired some celebrity for its bleaching processes,
from the introduction of workmen from Holland, and the establish-

mer Statistical Account was published, there were three printfields
and four bleachfields in the parish. The number of these has
since much increased, and both departments are simultaneously car-
ried on in the same establishments. The print-works and bleach-
fields now in operation are as follows:
