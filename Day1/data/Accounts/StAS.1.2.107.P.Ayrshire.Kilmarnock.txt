drainings from the stables and dunghill should be conducted
over it; by which means three or four rich crops of grass
would be raised in a season.  Round this spot, some rows of
trees should be planted, of such kinds as are proper for farm
utensils, for covering the houses, etc.  Should this be done
properly, the yard alone would supply much more than ever
the farm would need; the tenant would always have timber
at hand for all he wanted, and be at no farther expence but
that of cutting down the trees, and making his utensils; by
which means he might always have them good in their kinds,
and in perfect order at very little expence; the country would
be highly beautified and adorned, while the tenant would af-
ter all reap more benefit from the ground thus employed, than
from any other part of the farm of equal extent.  A few fruit
trees might be planted in one of the corners of this plot, and
would seldom fail, in such a situation, to produce a valuable
crop.-The forest trees, which are reckoned most proper for
general use, are the ash, the elm, the larix, and above all, the
Huntington willow.  From the top of one of these willows
when it comes to the size fo a tree, and has been formerly cut
over, there may be cut again, once in 16 or 20 years, for
country purposes, as much as is equal in value to 8 s or 10 s.
They grow rapidly in almost all foils, and are peculiarly ex-
cellent for the roofs of farm-houses, thatched in the manner
before described.  If they are allowed to grow to a sufficient
age without being cut over, they make excellent household
furniture, take a fine polish, are very light, and last long.
   If these plans were generally followed, it would complete,
in the space of a few years, the improved appearance of this 
part of the country, and add greatly to the comfort and hap-
piness of its inhabitants.  The plain of Cunninghame, of which
this parish makes a part, when viewed from the high grounds
of Kyle, lies in the form of a large and beautiful amphitheatre,
