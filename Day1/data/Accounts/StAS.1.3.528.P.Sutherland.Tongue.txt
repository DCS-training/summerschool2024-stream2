   Rent and conversion of Services.-The real rent of the pa-
rish is 525 L. 19 s. Sterling, in which are included 20 L. as the
conversion of those services, which the tenants were former-
ly used to perform to the proprietor, as the remains of the
feudal system.  These services were thought a very great
grievance, as the tenants were obliged to perform them, at the
time they should have been employed in cultivating their
own farms.  To work without maintenance from their em-
ployers, from morning to night, at the distance of several
miles from their respective homes, they justly deemed cruel
and oppressive, and a violation of the precepts of religion,
of justice, and the rights of men.  They therefore applied,
by petition, to the late Hon. and worthy Commander in
Chief of his Majesty's Forces in North Britain, General
M'Kay, (tutor to Lord Reay, the sole proprietor of this pa-
rish), praying for a conversion of said services into money,
which that humane and public spirited gentleman most
chearfully granted; and, in a letter to the minister of Tongue,
reprobated, in very severe terms, every remnant of such bar-
barity.  Thus the last vestige of feudal domination, and ty-
rannical oppression, in this remote northern corner of the
Highlands, has been abolished, under the auspices and influ-
ence of an honourable military gentleman, whose patriotic
character, and generous conduct, shall be perpetuated while
there is a M'Kay living in this country.  The farms, in ge-
neral, of which there are 130, consist of from 1 acre to 40
of arable land, besides pasture; and let at from 10 s. to 12 s.
the acre.
