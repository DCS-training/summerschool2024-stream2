	building, which remains in much the same state as it has done since
	1774, when it was rebuilt.
	   Mansion-Houses.-Besides the house of Abden, a plain old grey
	building, situated on the east side of Kinghorn, and commanding
	a beautiful and extensive view of the Forth, the mansion-house of
	Balmuto is almost the only other building in the parish worthy of
	the name.  Its square tower is of great antiquity, but the chief
	accommodation is of modern architecture.  It is well sheltered by
	the finely wooded grounds immediately, surrounding, and by the
	hills to the north and south.  The flower garden and conserva-
	tory mark the taste of the proprietor.

                            At the last census there were 1302 males-1632 females.

	   There, are no resident heritors in this parish.  Out 675 fa-
	milies in the parish, about 610 belong to the labouring classes,
	leaving only 65, consisting of farmers, shopkeepers, proprietors
	of houses, who cannot be classed among those who depend solely
	on their manual labour for subsistence.
	   The chief cause for the increase of the population since 1821,
	is the extension of the flax spinning mills, which has brought a
	considerable number of strangers to the place for employment.
	Females are chiefly employed in spinning, which accounts for the
	greater proportion of females above males in this place.
	   There are three or four famous persons in this parish, but none
	insane.  There is one deaf and dumb.

<FOOTNOTE>The population of this parish must have been as great as the close of the 16th
	century as it now is; for we find that the National Covenant has adhibited to it be-
	tween 800 and 900 names-a considerable proportion of which were heads of fami-
	lies, and probably all of them communicate.
