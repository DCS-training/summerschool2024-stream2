   Poor and Schools.-They are very attentive to the poor in
sickness and want.  They rarely have cash, but liberally be-
stow grain, etc.  The kirk session funds do not afford to
give annually above 3 s. to each of 50 poor in Tiry, and 34
in Coll.  There are also 5 s. or 6 s. allowed to help their in-

   Whatever these Islanders may be behind their neighbours,
any where on the mainland, is wholly owing to their great
disadvantages as to education.  I hope the period is now
arrived when the cloud shall be dispelled.  Till lately there
were only 10 L. of a parochial salary for a school.  Nine
years ago, the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian
Knowledge, bestowed 10 L. for another school.  These two
schools generally had not ten scholars each.  The people
had not taste for education, and there were complaints against
the teachers.  The Society have, since the Reverend Dr
Kemp's visit, added to these salaries a sum that enables the
teachers to teach all gratis, and bestowed a number of books
upon them.  The Duke of Argyle is pleased to add so much
for provisions which the parish should make.  A salary is
now granted, by the Society, for a school in Coll.  I doubt
not but they shall henceforth be all well attended, if the
schoolmasters be well chosen.  There are now often from 60
to 80 scholars in each.  From whatever source funds may
be obtained to accomodate this parish properly, Tiry requires
4 schools and Coll two.
   Our congregations were untaught singers, till the begin-

a small salary, employed by the Society for Propagating
Christian Knowledge, was sent for.  He teaches at so cheap
a rate, that it is belived 800 or 900 in the parish will attend
him this year.  The good effects may be great.  Singing is
