<FOOTNOTE>

*It should be adverted to, that the years 1739, 1740, and 1741,
were bad years, in which many died for want; however, the state of
these years cannot be well known at this time of day.  The parish may
not much differ from what is has been 5, 10, or 25 years ago, with re-
gard to the annual births, and the whole population; but it must be
attentively noticed, that there are great emigrations from our parish;
numbers of our young people go to sea, to Hudson's Bay, and to trades
out of the parish.  Our young female people run off to Newcastle, Leith,
and other places, and never rake certificates, which is now out of fashion,
and may be very discouraging to the more honest set; because every one
now, it seems, takes servants just as they get them-There are 3 or 
4 old men about 80, but none above at present.  I have known some
arrive at go or 95 years.  We have a number between 60 and 70; and,
in general, our people arrive to a good old age; owing, I suppose, to
temperance, drinking beer, and eating, some animal food, working hard,
and sheeping cheerfully, and following their employments with alacrity.
