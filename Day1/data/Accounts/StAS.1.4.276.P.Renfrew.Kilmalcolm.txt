     Statistical Account

   Agriculture, etc.-Planting is scarce, excepting about
Finlayston, Duchal, Carncuran and craigbate, where the
lime-tree abounds, and the soil is favourable for its growth;
there is also the elm, oak, plane and fir, and at Duchal
beech is in considerable perfection.  Farms are generally
inclosed.  Farmers are small and numerous.  For the
most part the farms rent from L. 20 to L. 60 Sterling
yearly; arable land lets at an average from 15 s. to 20 s.
the acre; meadow-ground from 30 s. to 45 s. oats (which
is the prevailing crop) are generally sown in the end
of March and beginning of April, and the reaping begins
for the most part in September.  Natural grass abounds;
the artificial is little cultivated, though the lime quar-
ry is only about 3 miles distant.  The farmer imagines him-
self more profited by collecting earthen dunghills.  Few
horses are reared.  The cows are generally of a small size be-
tween the highland and Galloway breed, but are mostly
good milk cows.  Sheep are rare.  The ploughs are gene-
rally of the Scots form, and made very strong, as the ground
is stony; each farmer uses only one, as the farms are small.
The plough is generally drawn by 3 horses, and 2 men are
employed.  Much of the ground might be ploughed with 2
horses and a ploughman accustomed to drive by the rein,
which is introduced of late with success.  Each farmer has
generally a single cart.  The farmer has a ready market for eve-
ry article at Port-Glasgow and Greenock, and a high price.

   Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-The stipend is L. 63: 17: 9 1/6
money, with three chalders of meal, which may be rated
at 16 s. the boll, amounting in all to about L. 102.  The
glebe of a shallow soil, at an average, may be valued at L. 8.
