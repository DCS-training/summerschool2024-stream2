     NEW PARISH,

     OR,

     TOWN OF GREENOCK.

     Situation, Extent, and Erection.

   ON the west side of the united bay of Greenock and
Crawfurdsdike, formerly called the Bay of St Lau-
rence, from a chapel near it, dedicated to that saint, and a-
bouth half way between the east and west boundaries of the
parish, is situated the town of Greenock.  In the beginning
of the present century, it consisted of a row of houses, cover-
ed with thatch, along the bay, and had no harbour what-
ever for vessels.  Now, with its suburbs, and the village of
Crawsurdsdike, adjoining to it on the east, Greenock may
be said to extend along the frith something more than an
English mile.  Its greatest breadth is scarcely an eighth of
a mile.  A few years previous to the year 1745, a new
parish was erected in Greenock, with consent of Sir John
Shaw, who made over the right of patronage to the heri-
tors and elders.
