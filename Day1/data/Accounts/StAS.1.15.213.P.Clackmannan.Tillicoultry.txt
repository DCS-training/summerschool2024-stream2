mains.  It unfortunately happened, that standing one day
on a stone, and looking up to the thorn tree, describing his
battles, he fell down the sloping bank of the terrace, and, it
is said, was killed on the spot, in the year 1620.  It may not
be improper to add, under this article, that in the popish le-
gends, Tillicoultry is mentioned as having been visited by St.
SERF or SERVANUS, and the scene of some of his pretended
miracles. St. Serf lived in the end of the 6th century, and
there is a particular account of him in Winton's Chronicle ^^,
a manuscript in the Cottonian library+.  Notwithstanding
the very remote antiquity of St Serf, his memory is still in
some degree, preserved, though his name is almost en-
tirely forgot; but he is represented, by tradition, as a holy
man, who travelled about the country, with a Scape Goat++,
which was unfortunately killed.  There is a heap of stones,
called Cairn Cur or Gur, which seems to have been intend-
ed to perpetuate the story of the goat.  The name has an e-
vident affinity to the Latin word Caper, and to the Gaelic,
Gobhur, which signifies a goat.

<FOOTNOTE>

^^WINTON, the author of the chronicle, was canon regular of St An-
drews, and prior of the monastery of Loch Leven, and lived in the end of the
14 century.

   +An excerpt from this chronicle was lately published by PINKERTON, in
the Appendix to his collection of Old Scottish poems.  One of the miracles
reported to have been performed by St Serf, was, the raising two young men
to life, who appear to have been brothers.  The account given of this in the
chronicle, if not very elegant, has at least the merit of being abundantly
brief:

     "In Tullycultry, til a wif
     "Two sonys he raisit frae ded to lyf."

   ++ In WINTON'S chronicle, in place of a scape goat, mention is made of a
ram.  The killing of the ram occasioned another miracle.  The story is a-
bundantly ludicrous, and as ludicrously related by the poetical biographer:
