the manners of preceding generations, it not seldom fired
the bosom with heroic ardour,
   But now, a company of country men, despising the pro-
verb, may be ranked among the disciples of the financial Ches-
terfield.  The allegory, no longer necessary to illustrate the
laws of economy, is reserved for the amusement of the nur-
sery.  The fret presents its terrors to the weakest class of old
women only.  And the song, to my sorrow, no longer paint-
ing the character of antient times, may vic in inanity with
the ordinary vehicles of Italian music.

   Opinion.-In opinion, an amazing alteration has been pro-
duced by education and social intercourse.  Few of the old
being able to read, and fewer still to write, their minds were
clouded by ignorance.  The mind being uncultivated, the
imagination readily admitted the terrors of superstition.  The
appearance of ghosts and demons too frequently engrossed the
conversation of the young and the old.  The Fye gave due
warning by certain signs of approaching mortality.  Elves by
their arrows destroyed, and not seldom unmercifully, cows
and oxen.  Fairies held from time immemorial certain fields,
which could not be taken away without gratifying these
merry spirits by a piece of money.  The old man's sold,
where the druid sacrisiced to the demon for his corn and cat-
tle, could not be violated by the ploughshare.  Lucky and
unlucky days, dreams and omens, were most religiously at-
tended to*; and reputed witches, by their spells and their
prayers, were artful enough to lay every parish under contri-
bution.  In short, a system of mythology full as absurd and
amusing as the mythology of Homer obtained general belief.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Lucky and unlucky days, dreams and omens, are still too much observed
by the country people: but in this respect, the meanest1 Christian far surpasses,
in strength of mind, Gibbon's all-accomplished and philosophic Julian!
