     Statistical Account

mon;-the larix is the favourite plant of the day; but its
rapid and towring growth renders it incommodious to be in-
terspersed in plantations.  It seems thus to be threatened
with exile to the tops of hills.  Even there, few of the spe-
cies fail.

   Schools.-Knowledge, as to both its state and extent, is as
respectable in Buittle as could well be supposed, whilst the
opportunities of acquiring it are considered.  There is a
public school, to which most of the children attending it
travel some 2, some 3 miles.  The schoolmaster is chosen
from year to year, as it is called, and the only security for
his salary of 10 l. is the good will of the heritors.  There
is also a cheaper school, having a stipend of 3 l. per annum:
Thus the whole funds of public instruction, for the rising
generation, for the whole parish of Buittle, are 13 l. Ster-
ling!-What can be the meaning of this parsimony?  Is it
from the learned, the well informed, the religious,-or is it
from the ignorant, "the mole-ey'd, half discerning," and
consequently unprincipled, that civil society just now stands
in dread?-From some circumstances, one would think it
was from the former.

   Poor.-Buittle has no poor's rate, in consequence few
poor, and no travelling beggars.  The colletions in the
church, joined to the prudent charity of well disposed per-
sons, afford abundant supply to those really in need.-Vaga-
bond beggars, the scum of cities, who beg half-a-crown a
day to drink it at night, are pretty numerous, and often
troublesome; nor is the law of the land very strictly execu-
ted, in repressing these pests of society.  Indeed, the failure
of manufactures at present, affords them too good an excuse
for their idleness.
