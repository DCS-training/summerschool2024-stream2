ten acre field, which was the last done, was nearly about
L. 6 per acre for labourers alone, exclusive of carts, horses,
and farm-servants.  But the whole might very probably
have been done at about L. 8 per acre, including every ex-
pence.  The same year, that field was well dunged and
limed, and sown with wheat, and yielded very near 14
bolls per Scotch acre, near 7 1/2 quarters Whinchester measure.
Wages are higher now; but still he thinks it would be
well worth while to dress many fields in the Carfe in the
same manner.  It is also worthy of remark, that the field
above mentioned had originally been a meadow, with a
great part of it moss, and before it was levelled and dressed,
the middle of it was so low and wet, it scarce ever bore a
crop worth reaping.

   Surface-drinking on Clay.-As clay is perfectly imper-
vious to water, surface-draining is the only means by which
this species of improvement can be accomplished; and all
over the Carfe of Gowrie, this operation is extremely
simple.  There are certain large common drains, which
pass through the district in different directions, sufficiently
capacious to receive the water drained from the fields by
the ditches which surround them, and of such a level as to
carry it clear off, and to empty their contents into the river
Tay.  There are also ditches which surround every farm,
or pass through them, as their situations may require, but
in such manner as to communicate with every field upon
the farm.  There ditches are made from 2 to 4 feet wide
at top, and from 1 1/2 to 1 foot at bottom; a shape which
prevents their sides from falling in; but even then they
must be cleansed and scoured every year at a considerable
expence.  If the fields be of an uniform level surface, the
common surrows between the ridges, provided they be
sufficiently deepened at their, extremities, will serve to lay
