ment,this great and extensive survey will probably
be completed.

   Astonished with so rapid a progress, and convin-
ced that the most important and beneficial conse-
quences must be derived from it, to Europe in gene-
ral, but more especially, to these kingdoms of Great
Britain and Ireland, I flatter myself, that it will not
be deemed improper or presumptuous, to submit, to
persons of power and authority abroad, the proprie-
ty of carrying on, in other states, similar investiga-
tions.  It is an undertaking which, though great and
laborious, yet may be effected in smaller kingdoms, by
the exertions of one individual; and, in the greatest
empires, by any body of men constituted for that pur-
pose.  In order to explain its nature, and the best means
of carrying it into execution, there is herewith printed,
an analysis of the statistical account of a parochial dis-
trict, a table which may render such accounts less ob-
scure or voluminous, and specimens of the accounts of
certain districs in Scotland, in many respects diffe-
rent from each other, and including almost every
possible variety.

   If similar surveys were instituted in the other
kingdom of Europe, it might be the means of esta-
blishing, on fure foundations, the principles of that
most important of all science, to wit, political or sta-
tistical philosophy.  That is the science, which, in pre-
ference to every other ought to be held in reverence.
