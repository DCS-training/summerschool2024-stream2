     Statistical Account

Masie about the middle of the parish, and the river Truime
at the eastern extremity.  Both these rivers fall into it from
the south, and have their rise in the Grampians.  Loch-lag-
gan, which, with  its environs, forms a district by itself, lies
on the south west extremity of the parish.  It is very deep,
with a bold rocky shore; and it is surrounded with woody
mountains.  On the south side is the Coill More, or Great
Wood, the most considerable remain of the great Coledo-
nian Forest.  This wood, which extends five miles along
the loch side, is the scene of many traditions.  At the east
end of the lake, the river Pattack, which is formed by a lake
of the same name, falls into Loch-laggan, which runs from
east to west, and discharges itself by the Spean river into
Loch-lochy, near Fort William.  The rivers Masie and Pat-
tack rum almost parallel to one another.  They are about
two miles distant.  The former goes by the Spey into the
German Ocean; the latter into the Western Sea.  There are
some other smaller lochs, as Loch n'Righ, or the King's Loch,
remarkable for large black trout, very fat and high flavour-
ed.  Loch laggan abounds with char, and various kinds of
trout.  In the Spey, there are some salmon, with plenty of
fine trout and pike, of a large size.

   Air, Soil, and Climate.-The air is moist, and generally ve-
ry cold; yet, so purified by storms, and kept in motion by
rapid currents, that it is, upon the whole, clear and healthy.
Along the banks of the river is a very rich and deep soil;
which, were it not for the disadvantages of inundations,
frosts, and mildews, would produce as rich crops as any in
the kingdom.  The lands that lie in slopes and declivities,
without the water-mark, are, though stoney, of a good qua-
lity, and produce surer crops than the rich meadows, being
earlier ripened, by the reflection of the sun from the adja-
