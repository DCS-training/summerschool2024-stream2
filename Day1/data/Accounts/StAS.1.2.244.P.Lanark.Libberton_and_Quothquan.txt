     Statistical Account

   Miscellaneous. Observations.- About a quarter of a mile to
the southward of the village of Libberton, there are quarries
of free-stone.  These stones are very easily got at; and are general-
ly used in building the few houses that are erected in the parish.
In the east part of the parish, there is a coal mine.  It has
not been wrought for these many years, which is a great loss,
not only to this, but to all the neighbouring parishes towards
the east, as we are obliged, for want of it to drive our coals
from places at the distance of 12 or 15 miles.
   The fuel made use of in the parish, is peat and coal.  There
is little, or no peat moss here.  They are mostly brought
from Carnwath; where each of the farmers, on Mr Lock-
hart's estate, have, what is called a room, in a large peat moss,
that lies to the southward of that village.  Coal is brought
partly from Douglass, and partly from Cleugh, in the parish
of Carnwath.  Fifteen stone of coals, (or what the people
here call a load,) cost 5 d. at Douglass; and at Cleugh, the
same quantity is bought for 4 d.
   The number of ploughs in the parish may amount to 46.
They are of the old Scottish kind, and made in a very clum-
sy manner.- The carts may amount to about 180.
   The people in this parish are very economical, and far from
being expensive or luxurious for their circumstances, except in
the use of tobacco.  Smoaking is almost universally practised
among both men and women.
   The people of this parish enjoy, upon the whole, a consi-
derable share of the comforts and advantages of life; and, from
their outward appearance, they seem to be contented with 
their situation.  The firm persuasion of a future state is their
great support, in the midst of all their poverty.  The first
way to meliorate their condition, is to give them better houses:
for at present, the cottages, and many, even of the farm houses,
are fitter for the habitation of beasts, than of human beings.
