thrive well in this district.  The trees promise well for a
few years, but soon decay.  It appears that not long ago,
the face of the country was mostly covered with woods.
It was then a great object to clear the ground of them;
but this spirit has been carried too far, as there are many
spots of ground which would make better returns to the
landlord, if producing wood, that if pastured, besides their
utility and ornament to the country.

9 yearly; of baptisms 33. It is only within these 40
years that any register was kept, and for 28 of these not
very regular.  Till within 40 years, the population is said
to have continued nearly the same for a long time back;
since that period, it has decreased by a third, and is still
decreasing.  There are not now 1000 persons in the pa-
rish.-  There are 12 weavers in the parish, who weave
coarse cloths and linens, such as the country people wear.
There is 1 mason, 3 carpenters; there are 2 blacksmiths, 5
tailors, 2 ferrymen, 2 innkeepers.  The people are sober
and industrious.  No person from this parish has been tried
for a crime, for many years back.  They respect the laws,
and pay due regard to their superiors, civil and ecclesiasti-
cal.  They are all of the established religion, and very
punctual in attending the service of the church.
