Whitehaven, and the other towns on the opposite side of the
Solway Frith, is daily, it is believed the utensils of husbandry
are just as well made here as any where else, and better ac-
commodated to the state and situation of the ground, than
could be done by a stranger tradesmen.  No oxen are used
for draught, probably owing to the temptation people have
of selling those home-bred horses, that are good, to the Eng-
lish and to jockeys in general.  The breeding of black cat-
tle, too, is followed by almost every farmer, as far as the
nature of things will permit.

   Prices of Labour, Improvements, etc.-The wages of ser-
vants are, for lot men, as they are called, or cottagers, about
14 l. per annum; but the articles of maintenance furnished
are, perhaps, estimated in Galloway, 2 l. or 3 l. a year lower
than in Lothian, and some other countries of Scotland.-La-
bourers, by the day, get from 1 s. 2 d. to 1 s. 4 d.-Farm
houses are generally very good, as well as offices.  In a word,
the continual repair of drovers, cattle-dealers, and even la-
bourers, to England, and the spirit of improvement that has
prevailed in this country for these 2o years past, has made
the farming of these parts nearly equal to what it is in the
southern part of the island, in all ordinary matters, and due
regard being had to the means of the inhabitants of the dif-
ferent countries.  As a test of the happy consequences, 4 or
5 of the best farms in Buittle, which, about the year 1747,
were rented at 200 l. Scotch, or 400 merks each, now pay,
(or would pay if out of lease), 230 l. a piece, whilst the te-
nants would live incomparably better than their predecesors.
One prejudice seems much to obstruct the success of the far-
mer in this part of the world-it is that of sowing too late.
The fields, where the corns shaken by violent winds, if early
ploughed, have been known to yield a respectable crop in
