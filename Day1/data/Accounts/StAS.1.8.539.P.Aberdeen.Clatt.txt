   Occupations.-Almost all the inhabitants occupy farms, of
greater or less extent, from 5 L. to 40 L. Sterling a year.  There
are even some as low as 1 L. 10 s.; and a few have only a house,
with the liberty of fuel, but no ground.  The artificers, or
trades people, such as wrights, tailors, smiths, etc. are merely
sufficient to supply the inhabitants with their respective forts
of work:  Some are paid by the day, or piece; others have
what is called custom work, i. e. a stipulated quantity of grain,
with their crosts plowed, and fuel brought in.  All have as
much land as enables them to keep a cow or two, and a yard,
er garden.

*There is no register of burials for this year.
+The above is the exact number buried in this church-yard, since 1783; but of these,
several are brought from other parishes, it being customary here, (as well as elsewhere)
for the posterity of former residenter, though removed from the parish, to bring back
their dead to what they call their own burial place.  Only a few of the residenters
have buried elsewhere.
