     Situation and Extent.

and harbours in Delting and Aisthsting.  On the south, it is
washed by the ocean.  It is, in most places, 9 miles long,
and 6 miles broad.  A very inconsiderable part of it is under
cultivation, and no exact measurement has ever been taken

extent of a merk land is very indefinite.  Some farms, which
are rentalled for 6 merks, are of mere extent, and worth more

These merks are valued by sixpenny, ninepenny, and twelve-
penny land.  Sixpenny land pays to the proprietor 8 merks
butter, and 12 s. Scotch, per merk.  Ninepenny land pays
12 merks butter, and 1 L. Scotch; and twelvepenny land pays
