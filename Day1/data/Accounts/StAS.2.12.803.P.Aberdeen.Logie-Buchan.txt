   The water of the Ythan is brackish, more or less, for nearly four
miles, but abounds with trout of various kinds, as the sea-trout,
bull-trout, yellow or burn-trout, finnock, salmon, eels, flounders,
&c. The salmon and sea-trout are said by the overseer to ascend
the river for spawning in summer, and to return towards the sea
with their fry in the months of March and April following.
The salmon-fishing, which belongs to the Honourable William
Gordon of Ellon, has been very unsuccessful of late years. Mr
Buchan of Auchmacoy has right to a private net for flounder-
fishing, which he occasionally exercises with success.  The river
is much resorted to by gentlemen from Aberdeen for rod-fishing.
Otter bunting has lately been practised by parties from Haddo
House, with Lord Aberdeen's hounds.  Seals sometimes make
their appearance in the river, opposite the church.
   The pearl muscle is found in the Ythan; and the pearl-fishery
seems to have been, in former times, an object of more attention
than it is now.  My predecessor mentions, that, in the list of un-
printed acts of the first Parliament of Charles I., there is an act
" for repealing the patent for the pearl-fishery in the Ythan,
granted to Robert Buchan."  This gives countenance to a preva-
lent tradition that the large pearl in the Crown of Scotland was
procured in the Ythan, it is said, by a person of the name of
Jamieson, and the very spot is pointed out where it was found.
About the middle of last century, a gentleman in Aberdeen got
L.100 Sterling, from a jeweller in London, for a lot of pearls
found in the Ythan. *  No wonder, then, that the Ythan has been
called " the rich rig of Scotland."  Pearls of considerable value
are yet occasionally found in it, during both the droughts of sum-
