   Swine, etc.-There is a superabundance of swine throughout
the parish: they are of a small size, fatten well, and their flesh
is peculiarly tender and delicate; but the damage they do, in the
winter season, to the grass and corn lands, as they are allowed to
roam at large, far exceeds any advantages, that can accrue from
the rearing of them.  Geese and other poultry are also in
great plenty, though not above half the number are reared,
since what was payable in kind to the proprietor, has been
converted into money.

   Coasts.-Dungisbay Head, the Berubium of Ptolemy, is si-
tuated in the N. E. corner of the island of Great Britain,
where the line of the coast, from a northern direction, turns
directly due west, and continues its course, till it reaches Cape
Wrath, with little or no variation in its restilinear direction.
This beautiful promontory is of a circular shape, about 2
miles in circumference.  Towards the sea, which encompasses
two thirds of the Head, it is one continued precipice.  On the
land side, you descend by a gentle slope into a deep valley, hav-
ing a small mossy rivulet running through it, which termi-
nates the Head on that quarter.  Near the top of the rock,
and on that side which faces the Orkneys, there, is a vast
gulph or cavern, (called, by the neighbouring inhabitants, the
Glupe), stretching all around perpendicularly down, till its
