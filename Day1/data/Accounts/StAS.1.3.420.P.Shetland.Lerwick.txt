     Statistical Account

by the town.  The church was built in 1782, on a very
handsome and commodious plan.

   Education.-There has not, as yet, been any established
school in the parish; but there are always one or two teach-
ers of English, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and navi-
gation, in it, who depend entirely on the quarterly payments.
Those, therefore, who wish to give their sons a grammatical
education, are under the necessity of bringing teachers from
the continent of Scotland, upon salaries paid according to 
their respective subscriptions.

   Rents, and Cattle.-No valuation of lands has as yet taken
place in Shetland.  The yearly rent of the country part of
the parish may be about 50 L. Sterling; and that of the
town 400 L.  The houses in both are all inhabited.  The
parish contains about 250 merks of arable land, besides
very extensive grass, meadow, and pasture grounds.  A
merk of land is a term perfectly indefinite:  In this parish it
is not nearly a Scottish acre.  There are about 200 cows,
1500 sheep, and many small horses in the parish.

   Antiquities.-In the country part of the parish, the ruins
of two Popish chapels, and two Pictish castles are to be seen.
At a rising ground, near the north end of the town, there
is a sort, said to have been built in the days of Oliver Crom-
well.  In the year 1781, it was repaired, under the direction
of Captain Fraser, Chief Engineer for Scotland, and called
Fort Charlotte.  It was garrisoned, until the peace of 1783.
It is now committed to the care of a corporal and 4 privates
of the train of artillery.
