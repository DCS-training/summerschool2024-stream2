we call here the Galloway sheep; they are black faced
and black legged, strong and hardy, but rather coarse in the 
wool.  There are still a few of the small white-faced sheep,
the original stock of this country, whose wool is far superior
to the present stock; but their weight is so inferior, that
they are much on the decrease, and only kept by some of 
the smaller tenants.  The white wool fold for the six years 
preceding Whitsunday 1793, at 7 a. 6 d. the stone in whole-
sale; the laid wool at 5 s.; but what was retailed (probably
3/4 of the whole) sold from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s. higher the stone.
Six, and often five sleeces of the laid wool make a stone;
from eight to ten go to a stone of the white.

   Price of Labour.-A male servant bred to common la-
bour, and fed by his employers, draws from L. 5, 15 s. to
L. 6, 6 s. yearly; a female servant bred and fed as above,
from L. 3 Sterling to L. 3, 10 s. and scarcely to be had for
the two years ending Whitsunday 1793 at these wages;
a common labourer without victuals from 1 s. 2 d. to 1 s.
4 d. the day, from the middle of March to the 1st of No-
vember; a tailor and shoemaker from 8 d. to 10 d. with 
victuals; a joiner, when employed for a temporary job,
and not by the piece, 2 s. the day; and a mason 2 s. 4 d.
A married workman employed through the year by the 
farmer, gets a house, kail-yard, peats, two cows grass, pota-
toe land, a stone of meal a-week, and L.1 Sterling, a-
mounting in all, communibus annis, to L. 12 Sterling.

   Church, Stipend, School, etc.-There are three places of
worship, and but one church in the parish; the incumbent 
should be absent every third Sunday from the mother-
church, at the distance of six and twelve miles alternately;
but the climate, and want of churches, render his attendance,
