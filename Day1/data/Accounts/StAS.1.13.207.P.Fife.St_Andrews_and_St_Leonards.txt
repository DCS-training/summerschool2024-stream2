     of St. Andrew's

As the average of births in these two periods is so equal,
the average of marriages so nearly the same, and the ave-
rage of deaths in the latter period is so much below that of 
the former, the presumption is, that the number of inha-
bitants is increasing.  And the reason why the average of
deaths has of late years decreased, may be, that the com-
mon people now use more generous food, are better clothed,
and more attentive to cleanliness in their persons, their 
manners, and their dwellings.  By the foregoing table it
appears, that the modern average of births in this parish is 
to the real number of inhabitants as 1 to 37 very nearly;
averaage of marriages as 1 to 160 nearly; average of deaths, 
as 1 to 49 1/2 nearly.-The number of artificers in the pa-
rish, masters and freemen, is nearly as follows:  Smiths, in-
cluding 1 watchmaker, 2 tinmen, 2 workers in brass, and 
3 glovers, incorporated with smiths, 21; wrights, car-
penters, and masons, 50; bakers, 19; fleshers, 19; tailors,
23; shoemakers, 34; weavers, 52; saddler, 1.-Besides
the prosessor of medicine in the university, there are in St.
Andrew's other 2 regular physicians; all the three practice
in midwifery and surgery, as occasion offers; on apotheca-
ry, who is also a practitioner in physic.  Several shopkeep-
ers vend a few of the more common medicines, such as eve-
ry neighbour prescribes to another; 5 writers or attornies;
2 messengers at arms.  The courts of law here are the Bailie
court, the Dean of Guild court, Justice of Peace court, and
the commissary court for the diocese of St. Andrew's whose
regular place of meeting is the church of St Salvator's Col-
lege.-There are no known instances of people dying here
for want, nor of murder, nor of suicide, excepting the cafe
of one man who hanged himself about fourscore years ago;
his body was dissected, and his skeleton remains in the uni-
versity library.  NO emigrations from this parish; and
