are other tradesmen in the village also employed in the manufac-
ture."

	Markets, &c.--There are no market-towns in the parish, and
there is, no village except Laurencekirk. In terms of the charter

quarters of a mile. A bailie and four councillors are triennially
elected on the first Wednesday of June, all resident feuars of
