surface, remarkably hard and durable.  One or two of the
hills are conical; but are so completely covered with grass, or
rurf, that nothing like Java can be seen.  Nor are there any
figured stones, coal, minerals, marble, freestone, or petri-
sactions in the parish.

   Soil and Agriculture.-The soil is various; and the striking
difference, between the soil on the south, and that on the north
of the Tweed, deserves particular attention.  In the former,
it is, in general, deep, heavy, cold, and wet, on a bottom of
clay or of rock.  It is, in some parts, perfectly red, and iron
stones are found amongst it.  In other places, it is very po-
rous; but though light, is not sandy, or lying on gravel.-
There are several small lakes, and mosses, which yield excel-
lent peats; and, when drained, some of them are full of shell
marle, of a good quality.-Oats, a small quantity of barley,
and a few pease, were the only crops raised, till within these
few years, that marle began to be used.  Turnips, red and
white clover, are now introduced, and the annual quantity of
pease and barley, is considerably increased.  Of 500 acres,
which, for the last five years, have been annually ploughed,
not above four-fifths, have, at an average, been sown with oats;
whereas, formerly, that grain was sown upon, at least, nine-
tenths of the ploughed ground.  The other fifth is employed
in turnips, clover, peace, barley, and a few potatoes; and,
sometimes, in low grounds, there are small spots of wheat.-
They sow as early as the season will permit, which is never
before March; yet they reap late, seldom before September,
and sometimes have corn in the fields in November.
   Though only 500 acres, or thereabouts, are, at an average,
in corn every year, yet, of the 2700, of which this part of
the parish consists, at least 1500 acres have, in a kind of rota-
tion, been torn up, partly for the sake of enriching the soil with
