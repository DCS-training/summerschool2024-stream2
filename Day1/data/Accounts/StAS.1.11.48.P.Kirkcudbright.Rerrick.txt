     Statistical Account

great plenty and variety of fish on the coast, though hitherto
there have been no spirited exertions to ascertain the truth of
this.  There have indeed been several feeble attempts made
in the Bay of Heston, which have proved successful, and cor-
roborated the common opinion.  Along the whole shore, but
particularly about Heston, there is plenty of shell fish of the
common kinds.

   Minerals.-In the lands of Lord M'CARTNEY, there is a rich
iron mine, which was opened up and carried on for some time
by an English company, but is now desisted from: Not, how-
ever, that it is by any means exhausted; but owing entirely
to the expence and inconvenience of shipping it.  The coast
every where abounds with free-stone, which hath been much
in request of late, for the ornamental parts of some of the most
elegant houses, both in this and the neighbouring parishes;
and last year it was carried by land, at the distance of 12
miles, to one of the most magnificent structures in the country.
There are no less than three places on the shore, which have
been laid open, and declared, by act of parliament, to be free
ports, viz. Balcarry, formerly mentioned, on the E,; Port
Mary, (so called from MARY Queen of Scots taking shipping
after the battle of Langside), on the S.; and Mullock Bay on
the S. W.  The first of these is safe and commodious by na-
ture; the other two might be made so, by a little assistance
from art; that at Port Mary especially, by expending a few
hundred pounds upon it, might be rendered inconceivably ad-
vantageous.  And as all the gentlemen, whose properties lie
contiguous to it, are very public spirited, it is to be hoped,
that, in this improving age, they will soon take up the matter
in a serious light.
