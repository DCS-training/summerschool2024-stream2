*In order to give some idea of the populousness of this part of the
country, it may not be improper to observe, that there are 20 parishes in
this presbytery exclusive of the town of Perth, all of which lie round it as
their common centre, and are all, except 4, within 6 miles of it.  These
4 are about 9 or 10 miles distant from Perth.  Six parishes lie south of
Earn; S, north of Tay; and the rest, including Perth itself, between the
Earn and the Tay.
