of other parishes, they certainly enjoy better health.  Medi-
cal assistance is seldom necessary, unless for those who have
been infected elsewhere.

   Cattle.-Owing to a circumstance formerly mentioned,
there are probably more horses in this parish than in most
others of the same extent.  As they are continually chang-
ing their pastures, and frequently their owners, it is impos-
sible to calculate their number with precision.  From the
most accurate and authentic information, there are at present
in the parish,
     309 horses
     2009 black cattle
     3460 sheep.

The sheep are mostly of the Golloway breed.  A few of the
larger kind of English sheep have been lately tried, and have
turned to good account.
   The wool is generally sold to the people of Kilmarnock,
from 6 s. to 12 s. per stone, and about 570 stone is sold an-
nually.
   It may be added, that some horses and black cattle are fed
in Kelburn parks after the first stock is removed.

   Roads, etc.-The great road from Glasgow to Port-Pa-
trick runs through the whole extent of the parish.  Formerly,
it went over some high roads towards the north end of it;
but, about five years ago, a new road was made from Skel-
murly to Largs, along the shore.  The expence of this is
defrayed by a toll at Kelly-bridge, rested at 72 l. 15 s.  The
conversion of statute labour is 47 l. 10 s.  The roads is kept
in good repair; there are bridges upon it, three of which are
lately built.
