ther fortified the castle of Kilkerran, and left in it a garrison
to overawe Macdonald of Kintyre, whose castle of Duniveg
stood within half a mile of the King's.  But the daring
chieftain and his followers were not to be thus intimidated.
Before the King had got clear of the harbour, they added in-
sult to rebellion, took the castle, and hung the governor from
the wall, as a signal of their conquest.
   As the troubles of the times, and the impotence of govern-

bringing the Macdonalds to order.  The Revolution in 1688,
gave such strength and vigour to government, as to make
its influence extend to those distant corners of the kingdom.

his chance of a share in that LIBERTY, which is the peculiar
boast and blessing of the natives of this isle.
   Since that period, the nature of civil liberty is undoubtedly
better known in the Highlands, and property is much more se-

predecessors, the fierce sovereigns of this country, ever sported
wantonly with the lives of their subjects, otherwise than by
exposing them to the calamities of war; and in this respect it
is hardly necessary to remark, that the politest people of our
own times will match them.
   It is but justice to say of the M'Donalds, that they were
probably no worse than the times required.  A rough people
