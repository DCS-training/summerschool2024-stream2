     General Appendix to

   It is unfriendly to the interests of this parish, in many re-
spects, that although there be no fewer than ten heritors,
none of them reside in the parish, except Mr Thomson of
Banchory, who resides during summer.
   Agriculture appears in this parish in all its various forms;
insomuch, that to give any particular account of the treat-
ment of the land were impossible.  I am happy, however, in
being able to state, that a spirit of improvement is diffusing
itself fast; and to this the turnpike roads, which are made
in different directions through the parish, contribute not a
little.
   There are three midwives in the parish; and from the
vicinity of Aberdeen, where is an infirmary and many pro-
fessional men of abilities, the parishioners here can be at no
loss for excellent medical and surgical aid, when necessary.
But it unfortunately happens that the cheapest is often pre-
ferred; and any half-taught apothecary, who places a Cullen's
head over his door, and impudently has the word Doctor
painted under it in large characters before his name, pro-
cures more employment among the lower classes, than the
most able physician.
   Prejudice against inoculation is so deeply rooted here,
that very little progress has as yet been made towards re-
moving it.
