mortifications for the poor of Chanory; the one by BARBARA
M'KENZIE Countess of Seaforth, anno 1680, of 17 bolls
firlots land rent, under the administration of the ministers of
Rosemarkie and Avoch; and the other of 27 bolls, from some
lands disponed by Bishop PATERSON, and others purchased
with money mortified by Sir ALEXANDER M'KENZIE of Coul,
whereof the magistrates are administrators.  These are no

Countess of SEAFORTH; and, in the deed of mortification, the
ministers of Rosemarkie and Avoch, are left sole administra-

in Fortrose, having been nominated during their lifetime only.
At what time this money was first received, or how it was
applied for many years, there is no evidence to be found.  It
is certain, however, that the mortification was much neglected,
and in danger of being entirely lost.  Its recovery was greatly
owing to the exertions of Mr. ALEXANDER RAY, minister of
Avoch, with the assistance of Mr. NICOL SPENCE, then agent
for the church, who were forced to raise a process against those
