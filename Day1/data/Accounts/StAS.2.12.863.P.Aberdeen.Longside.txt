ants is given as being 1979 ; but there is reason to think this state-
ment inaccurate.  In the beginning of 1791 the writer of the last
Statistical Account found the number to be only 1792, of whom
817 were males, and 975 females, there being nearly, 4 persons to
a family.

<TABLE>
     The population in  1801 was 1825-  846 males,  979 females.
			      1811,    2077-  940 do.    1137 do
			      1821,	   2357- 1079 do.    1278 do.
         		      1831,	   2479- 1111 do.    1368 do.
			      1841,	   2612- 1165 do.    1445 do.

   From this it appears that no decrease has been found at any cen-
sus within the last fifty years ; but that the rate of increase has been
smaller, during the last twenty years, than during the previous part
of this century.  One cause most probably is, that., during the
first quarter of the century, two villages, Longside and Mintlaw,
had been founded and encouraged, in which, for about fifteen
years past, scarcely an additional house has been built.  Another
cause is, that, during the former period, there was a flourishing
manufactory of woollen cloth, which ceased in 1828, and thus oc-
casioned the removal of many of the people employed, previously
to the census of 1831.

   Instances of insanity are very rare.  There are, at present, 3
fatuous persons, 3 blind, and none deaf and dumb.
   Illicit distillation and smuggling of all kinds have been disused
for many years.  The people are diligent and painstaking.  They
are also, in general, contented with their circumstances, unless we
except from this remark the unmarried servants of both sexes,
who, of late years and throughout this district, have been haunted
by a restless spirit, which causes them to change their employ-
ers almost every six months.  In many cases, however, it is hard
