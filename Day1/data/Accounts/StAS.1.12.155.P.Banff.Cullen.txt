<FOOTNOTE>

probable answer to this is, that as the had a daughter married to the then
Earl of Sutherland, she had come upon a visit to her daughter.  And as
She family of Sutherland had then considerable property in the Boyn and Enzie,
probably some friend of that family lived in this house, where the Queen is
said to have died.  Whether the burying her bowels in the church implies the
burial of the whole body, or whether the bowels only were interred in Cullen.
I shall not take upon me to determine; but I never heard of any other place for
her interment.
