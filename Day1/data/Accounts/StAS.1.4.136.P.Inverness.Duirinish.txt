dale.  There are also the ruins of several towers, reported
by tradition to have been built by the Danes.  These
towers seem not to have ever exceeded 20 feet in height.
They are circular in their form, and were built in a very
substantial manner, with large stones, without any cement.
They had an inner wall, very neatly built, with an empty
space of about 5 feet in breadth, between the two walls,
with openings through the inner wall, into the void space
or interval between the two walls.  They do not appear
to have been ever roofed; but the two walls were joined
to each other at the top, by long flag-stones laid across be-
tween the two walls, and covered with earth.  The void
spaces between the walls, probably were intended for places
of shelter and repose, and for preserving arms and provi-
sions from the weather; and as every one of these towers
is built in sight of one or more of the same, it is natural to
think that they were intended for places to make signals
from by smoke and fire, upon an alarm, or the sight of an
enemy, and likewise for defence; for as they are all built
upon eminences, a few men could defend one of them a-
gainst a thousand, before the invention of cannon and gun-
powder.  There are two tombs in the parish.  In one of
them, about 70 years since, an urn was found, containing 
some ashes.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-As to the size of the people,
they are of a low stature, the men in general from 5 feet

6 feet high; they are however active and lively.  The
common people of Sky are blessed with excellent parts; a 
liberal share of strong natural lense, and great acuteness of
understanding.  They are peaceable and gentle in their 
dispositions, and are very industrious when they work for
themselves; but when they work for hire or wages, they
