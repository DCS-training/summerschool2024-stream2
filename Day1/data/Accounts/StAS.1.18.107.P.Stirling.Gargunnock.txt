is commonly this; oats for two years in succession, and barley
the third year with grass seeds, hay for two years, and pas-
ture for three or four.  Potatoes are also raised in considera-
able quantities, and there is not a crop to which the soil is
better suited.  The return is very encouraging.  A boll and a
half, and often two bolls are digged where one peck was
planted.  Some lay the sets in drills, which undoubtedly is
the best way, as by this means the rows are distant from each
other near 2 feet, the plough can be used among them,
throughout the summer, and while this answers every pur-
pose of summer fallow, the earth is raised about their roots,
which makes them dry and mealy, and promotes vegetation.
A field in potatoes is a fine preparation for wheat or barley.
None of the red kind are here used, excepting the yam,
which grows to a very large size, and affords good food for
cattle.
   The carse farmers are careful to procure horses of superior
size and strength.  For the most part the ploughing, summer
fallow excepted, is conducted with two horses, without a
driver.  Four must at times be employed in summer fallow-
ing.  Less progress perhaps may be made with two horses
than with four, but the work is better done, as two pro-
perly trained, and acquainted with the ploughman's voice,
will proceed with more steadiness, and in a straighter direc-
tion than four, drawing unequally, and injudiciously driven
by an ignorant boy.
   In each farm there is a field in wheat, well dressed and
limed.  It has been found that dung is more advantageous to
the wheat than lime, and several farmers now give lime to the
barley fields, and dung to the wheat.  One of them this year
gave the wheat field a past of both, and the return is
luxuriant.
