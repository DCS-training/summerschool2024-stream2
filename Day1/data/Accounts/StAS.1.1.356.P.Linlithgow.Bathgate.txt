     Statistical Account

now consumed in the parish in a month, than was in a twelve-
month forty years ago.  The alteration in dress since 1750 is also
remarkable.  When the good man and his sons went to kirk,
market, wedding, or burial, they were clothed in a home
spun suit of freezed cloth, called kelt, pladden hose, with a
blue or brown bonnet; and the good wife and her daughters
were dressed in gowns and petticoats of their own spinning,
with a cloth cloak and hood of the same, or a tartan or red
plaid.  But now, the former, when they go abroad, wear
suits of English cloth, good hats, etc.; and the latter the finest
printed cottons, and sometimes silk gowns, silk caps, and bon-
nets, of different shapes, sizes, and colours, white stockings,
cloth shoes, etc.

     Roads.-The turnpike road leading from the iron works
at Cleugh to Borrowstounness runs through the parish, as
also a branch from the great road between Edinburgh and
Glasgow by Whitburn.  Considering the great number of
coal and lime carts daily on them, the roads are in pretty good
order.  They were originally made, as well as kept in repair,
mostly by the statute labour, which is sometimes commuted,
but chiefly exacted in kind, at the discretion of the overseer.
Each ploughgate of land is obliged to work at the rate, or
pay 12 s. per annum; and the village of Bathgate pays a con-
siderable sum for repairing the roads, though the streets  of
the town are in very bad order.
