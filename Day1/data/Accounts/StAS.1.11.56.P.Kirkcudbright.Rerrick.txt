which men of their rank now make, it must necessarily pro-
duce a material difference in the face of things, in comparison
of former days.

   Manufactures and Villages.-What now gives a prospect of
comfort, affluence, and importance to the lower class, is a spi-
rit of cotton manufacture got in amongst us; which we hope
will in time lead to the woollen.  Here we have two small
villages; one at the old Abbey, and another at the head of
Heston Bay At the former, a few spirited young men com-
menced business last summer.  At the latter, a company of
farmers, headed by a patriotic gentleman, are making pre-
parations for beginning the next; having subscribed a capital
of 1,200 L. for that purpose.  The machinery of the last men-
tioned place is to go with water.  And it is now also in con-
templation, to erect a similar house in the lands of Mr. Cairns
of Dundranen.  Close by each of these villages runs a burn,
with water sufficient to drive pretty heavy machinery; and,
as their fountain heads are several hundred feet higher than
where they empty themselves into the sea, works of that kind
might be erected alongst them, in succession, for miles.  Be-
sides these, we have other three not greatly inferior.

   Disadvantage.-But with all these natural advantages, be-
sides the exportation of such a surplus of grain, and our
commodious situation with respect to harbours, there is one,
and only one, insuperable barrier to the carrying on of manu-
factures here, to any considerable extent, viz. the want of
fuel.  For notwithstanding our large and numerous mosses,
such are the circumstances (which it would be needless here
to narrate); that peats, to the generality of the inhabitants,
are nearly as high, and ten times less comfortable, than coals
