tains, its breadth is very irregular.  In the S. E. and N. W.
where the Elk divides it from the parishes of Laugholin and
Eskdalemuir, the breadth, at an average, does not exceed
miles; whereas between the church, which is nearly in the
centre, and the N. W. end of the parish, the breadth, in some
places, is little short of its length.  Though the length on the
S. exceeds, by 2 miles, that on the N. bank of the Elk, yet
as Westerkirk extends a great way among the hills to the
northward, till it reaches the boundaries of Tiviotdale, two
thirds of the parish, or thereabouts, are situated on the N.
side of the river.  The parish consists of 27,307 acres; but
not more, perhaps, than a twentieth part of it arable.

   Surface, Soil, and Climate.-The appearance of the country
is hilly; and the hills in general are high.  Some of them
are covered with heath, but they are mostly green and dry,
and afford excellent pasture for sheep.-The soil is various;
the lower grounds along the hanks of the Esk, which are flat,
consist in general of a light loam, and produce plentiful crops
when under proper management: The soil on the rising
grounds is a deep strong loam, interspersed with stones; and
the tops of many of the hills are covered with moss.-The
climate is not unhealthy, though somewhat moist, as the hills
on the S. side of the parish are among the first that intercept
the clouds, in their progress northward, from the Irish sea and
the Solway Frith.

   Rivers.-The Black, Esk, dividing the parish of Westerkirk
on the S. from that of Eskdalemuir on the N., for about a
mile in length, falls into the white Esk at a place named the
King Pool*, in the neighbourhood of the farm house of Bailie-
