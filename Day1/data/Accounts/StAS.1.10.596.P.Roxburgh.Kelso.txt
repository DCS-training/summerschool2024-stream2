warm and the air moist; but it would not probably have
proved so baneful, had proper attention been paid to clean-
ing the gutters of the streets, and to cleanliness in general.
The greatest part of the town stands upon a level, it there-

more applicable to the inhabitants of Kelso, than to the north
in general.  Did they but know what a fomes for disease un-

plague has been often attributed; for ever since they became

hills, whose wool and skins are lent to the most distant parts
of the island, are circumstances so peculiarly favourable to

Galashiels, the one 20, and the other only 16 miles from
