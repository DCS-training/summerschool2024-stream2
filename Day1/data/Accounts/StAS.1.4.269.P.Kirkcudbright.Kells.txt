of the parish that is within 2 or three miles of it.  Such as
are farther distant, hire young lads into their families, that
have been bred at the public school, to teach their children
English, and the first principles of writing and arithmetic,
which they can do for L. 3 or L. 4 a-year.  When 4 or 5
families lie contiguous to one another, they hire a teacher
among them, for which they pay from L. 5 to L. 6, with
victuals; and by this means all the children in the parish
are taught to read and write.-At an average for the last
12 years, the number of poor, quarterly supplied with alms,
is 12; average of collections for that time, L. 12, 10s.;
interest of a fund received in legacies, and otherwise, L. 8,
10 s.; which together make L. 21, given annually to the
poor.

servant, from L. 3 to L. 4.  A healthy and industrious man
is able to maintain and bring up a family.-The fuel com-
monly made use of is peat; scarce at New Galloway and
neighbourhood.  The moss is 3 miles distant, inaccessible
to carts, by reason of the badness of the roads; carried
home in corn-sacks, on horses backs, which, considering
the distance, greatly increase the expence, and hinder the
poorer fort, who have not horses of their own, from get-

broom, furze, and other brush-wood, to supply the defi-

of easy access, and of good quality.  Every family out
