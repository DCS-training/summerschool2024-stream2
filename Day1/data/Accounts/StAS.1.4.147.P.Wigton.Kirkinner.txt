manufacturers in a situation such as ours, where our new e-
stablishments must rival old ones in neighbouring districts.
But, perhaps, the greatest barrier against household indu
stry and manugacture among us, is the scarcity of fuel in
many parts of the country.  A human being pinched with
cold, when confined within doors, is always and inactive be-
ing.  The day-light, during the winter, is spent by many 
of the women and children in gathering elding, as they call
it, that is, sticks, furze, or broom, for fuel, and the even-

which this produces.  Could our Legislators be conducted
through this  parish in the winter months; could  the Lords
and Commons, during the Christmas recess, visit the cot-
tages of the poor through these parts of the united king-
dom, where nature hath refused coal, and their laws have
more than doubled the price of it, this would be Shake
speare's "wholesome physic;" and would, more than any
thing else, quicken their invention to find ways and means
of supplying the place of the worst of taxes.
