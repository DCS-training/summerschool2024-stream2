   Fish.-The lakes produce trouts and slounders.  Ling, cod,
tusk, skate, hollibut, and dogfish are caught in abundance on
the coast of Unst, as well as of all the other Shetland isles.
Pitlocks, fillocks*, haddocks, mackarels, and slounders, are
got immediately upon the shore.  The shell-fish are spouts,
muscles, cockles, cullocks, smurlins, partans, crabs, limpets,
and black wilks.  A few sturgeons are sometimes driven a-
shore here, by high winds.  The porpoise is frequently seen,
but seldom caught.  Large lean whales are sometimes
stranded in the creeks, and somtimes chased ashore by
boats.  These commonly measure from 60 to 90 feet in
length, and are denominated sinners.  The spermaceti
whale, a much more valuable prize, sometimes wanders to
this coast, and is here entangled and taken.

   Fisbery.-Fishing is an important branch of the industry
of these inslanders.  By the safe of the ling, cod, and tusk
which they take, the tenants obtain money to pay their
rents.  About 80 tons of these fish have, upon an average,
been annually taken, for these last seven years.  These are
salted and dried, and in this state exported to Barcelona,
Ancona, Lisbon, Leith, and Hamburgh.  The season for
taking them, is from the beginning of June to the middle
of August.  All the men, in health, from the age of 16 to

*These are a species of small grey fish, which are taken in large quan-
tities upon the coast, and contribute greatly to the sustenance of the poorer
inhabitants.  They are a very nourishing article of food, and good oil is
also prepared from them.  In the present season, they have been taken
in such abundance, that about 100 hogsheads of their oil will probably be
exported, besides what may be used in the island.  The oil is prepared
from the livers of these fishes.  They are fished with rods, and the bait
used in angling for them is limpets, which have been previously boiled, to
part them from the shell.
