     Statistical Account

   School.-There are in the parish 3 schools, at which about
300 boys and girls are annually educated.  At the parochial
school there are often about 100, many of whom come from
distant parts of the country; and at each of the other two
schools from 60 to 80.  One of these schools has been esta-
blished by the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge,
with a salary of 12 L.  There, 30 or 40 boys and girls
are annually taught gratis.  The other schoolmaster is pre-
centor at the chapel of ease, lately built on the south side of
the parish, and has a small salary, but chiefly depends upon
the profits of his school,

   Poor.-In a parish so extensive, where the farms are small,
and where there are many day labourers and cottagers, situat-
ed at a distance from fuel, there is, as may naturally be
supposed, a great number of poor.  At present there are up-
wards of 20, who receive a monthly supply, and perhaps 30
more, who receive a little now and then from the parish funds.
There are also some poor families, who, once a year, get what
may serve to pay their house rent, to clothe one or more of
their children, or to buy a few coals.-The funds consist of
the collections at the church, which amount to about 30 L. per
annum:-The mortcloth dues, the rent of a few seats in the
church, and interest of money, make about 18 L. or 19 L. more;
to which the heritors (much to their honour), add 20 L. Sterling,
amounting, in whole, to within a trifle of 70 L. Sterling; which,
with what is given by the family at Drummond Castle, over
and above Mr. Drummond's share, in common with other heri-
tors, serves to keep the poor (in that neighbourhood), at
home, without begging from door to door.

   Antiquities.-There are two Roman camps in the parish; one
at Strageath, and another at Ardoch; besides several forts of
