     Statistical Account

the house, which is beautifully situated on the banks of the
river Clyde, occupy 500 acres of rich land, and have been
laid out with great taste.

   Antiquities.-The only Roman camp in this part of the
country had been on the south side of this parish, on a rising
ground near the Clyde.  The camp itself is an exact square of
six acres, and notwithstanding the attempts of the plough and
spade to destroy the works of that great people, the praeto-
rium is still visible, and the walls of circumvallation pretty
entire.  The causeway leading to the camp and from it, is in
a direct line, and can be traced several miles.  Pots and dishes
of different sizes, and instruments of war and sacrifice, have
been lately discovered.  Coins of various kinds and of differ-
ent value have been digged up, bearing the inscription of
M. Aurelius, M. Antoninus, etc.  Some of these coins have
been sent by Mr Fullerton, to the Antiquarian Society, and
to the University of Glasgow.

   Character.-As the writer of this account has resided in this
parish only for a very short time, he is by no means qualified to
draw the character of the people.  He can say with truth, that
they are regular in attending divine worship; and is told, that
they all adhere to the church of Scotland, a few persons in
the extremity of the parish excepted, who find it convenient to
attend a burgher meeting at Davie's Dykes.
