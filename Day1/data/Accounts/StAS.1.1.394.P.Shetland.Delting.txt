Every man, from the age of 18 to 70, must attend the fishing
from the 1st June to the 14th August.  None are left at home
but a wife, with perhaps a number of young children, who
require all her attention.  Every thing in the farming line 
must consequently go to wreck.

   The horned cattle and sheep are small, but the beef and
mutton sweet and well flavoured.  The sheep, in general, carry
very soft fleeces.  A few are to be found which carry wool of 
a very fine quality, of which stockings are made, that sell at
different prices, from 15 s. to 40 s. a pair.  Some are knit so
fine as to be easily drawn through a common ring, and do not
weigh above 2 ounces.  In the year 1782, the best ox could
have been bought for L. 20 Scots; the best cow from L. 12 
to 15 Scots.  This year, 1790, and for a few years past, 
L. 36 Scots is thought a moderate price for a good ox; and 
L. 24 Scots is often paid for a fat cow.  The price of
sheep seems to have varied very little in the memory of man.
In the neighbourhood of Lerwick, 5 s. are paid for a wedder;
but in this parish, and many other parts of the country, 3 s.
is thought a high price.  The carcase of an ox weighs
from 3 to 4 cwt.; that of a cow from 170 to 230 lb.  A well
grazed cow yields from 32 to 42 lb. tallow; a well grazed
ox from 48 to 70 lb. sometimes 90 lb. tallow.

   Population.-In 1752, the number of souls in the parish were
956.  In 1785, there were 1417.  In 1790, there were 1504.
There are now alive only 5 householders who were living 25
years ago.  One woman is now alive aged 101 years; another
died lately at the age of 105; and another died in 1784 at
the age of 98.  She died in the same house in which she 
was born, and had slept only two nights out of it.  The
number of families is now 223.  Each householder has a
