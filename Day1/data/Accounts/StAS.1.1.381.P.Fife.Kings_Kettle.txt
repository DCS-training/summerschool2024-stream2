kind, and partly committed.  A turnpike bill for the county
was obtained last session, and the gentlemen of the county
are using every exertion for putting it in execution.

   Antiquities, etc.-On Banden Hill, which overlooks Coal-
ton from the eastward, and commands an extensive view of
the Strath of Eden, from Kinross to St Andrews Bay, are
some remains of a circumvallation and rampart, of which
tradition is silent.  It is of a circular form, and nearly 200
yards in diameter.  About half a mile to the eastward
is another eminence, with ruins of the same kind on its
summit.  It is called Down Hill; is the highest in the pa-
rish; and commands the whole Strath of Leven, the Firth,
and the Lothians.  From the situation of these buildings, they
were probably used as places of observation.  The Knock of
Clathe is a beautiful hill, rising smoothly without any appear-
ance of fortifications.  A regular coffin, of fix stones, was
found here some time ago, by men who were digging for
gravel.  Within it were human bones, and several trinkets
among which was the brass head of a spear, now in the pos-
session of the Earl of Leven.  There are at least 8 barrows
in the parish, 3 of which have names:  Pandler's Know, and
Lowrie's Know, in Forthar ground; and Liquorich Stone in
Kettle ground.  Bones have been found in the rest.  There
is a tradition about the first, that, when dissensions arose be-
tween families in different parts of the country, they met
there to decide their contention by arms, and those who fell
were buried in the tumulus.  The barrow in Forthar is said
to have been a regular place of burial, and to have had a 
church or chapel near it.  But of this no vertiges are now
extant.
