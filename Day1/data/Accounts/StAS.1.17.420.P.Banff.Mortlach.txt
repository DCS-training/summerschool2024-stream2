   These occupied 415 houses, for every family had its own
separate dwelling, making between 4 and 5 at a medium in
each, though very unequally divided, some as large as 18 or
20, including husband, wife, chidren, land servants, and some
as small as one.  Such solitary householders, however, and
such numerous families were both but few.
   Of the above 415 houses, farmers might be said to possess
176; and crofters, or cottagers, the remaining 239:  And
on the lands of the several proprietors, the proportions of
the people and their habitations were as follows:

On the Duke of Gordon's        927       in      193 houses.
            Lord Fife's        761       in      176 ditto
            Kinninvie's        226       in       45 ditto
And on Drummuir's                4       in        1 house.
                            ----------        ------------
                 As before    1918       in   415 houses.

   The subjoined statement of births, for 30 years, from the
1st of January 1763 to the 31st of December 1792 inclu-
sive, arranged in 3 equal periods, is taken from the parish
register, and is thought tolerably correct.  An allowance
may be made perhaps for 2 or 3 being omitted every year.
