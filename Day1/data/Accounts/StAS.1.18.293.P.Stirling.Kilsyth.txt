size; being nearly 40 or 50 yards diameter.  The outer wall
or inclosure, for some of them have evident marks of smaller,
but irregular inclosures within, consists of a rude mass, of
large and small tumbling stones, built without any regularity
or order; and without mortar of any kind.  In times of ig-
norance and barbarism, they may however have been places
of considerable strength.  Though it seems very uncertain
for what purpose they were at first erected.
   That they were strong holds, or places of defence, or shel-
ter, seems unquestionable.  Indeed the name they bear, seems
to indicate this much; for chester in Gaelic, signifies a camp.
And as the name is of Gaelic original, for this as well as
other reasons, I am disposed to think they are of greater an-
tiquity, than even Agricola's wall, or Graham's dyke.  Per-
haps they are coeval with the Roman forts; and it is general-
ly allowed, that these were formed before the wall.
   If this be the case, in all probability, these chesters may
have been intended as places of refuge, for the women and
children, and the defenceless and unarmed inhabitants of
this district.  To them they would naturally fly for shelter,
in case of an unexpected defeat, or sudden incursion of the
Roman invaders, The situation and structure of these forti-
fications, seem both to favour this conjecture.  They are si-
tuated at no great distance from the Roman wall; lying along
the north side of the valley, which was the boundary of that
empire.  Besides this, they contain a number of small subdi-
visions, like the ruins of rude huts, which might have served
for shelter from the storm; as the great outer wall was for
safety from the invader.
   This at least seems a more plausible conjecture, than that
they were intended as a place of security for cattle, and the
other stock and moveables of the natives.  They are too small
to contain any considerable number of cattle.  And besides
