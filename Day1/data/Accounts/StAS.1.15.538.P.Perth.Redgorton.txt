they build with whin-stone, either in time of rain or in
thaw after frost, the houses become damp by the stones
sweating, or becoming moist; a fault which only can be
remedied by lathing the walls with wood, which is the case
with the manse.  There are many clay pits from which they
make excellent bricks.
   The gross rental of the whole parish, amounts nearly to
one thousand and seven hundred pounds, including the fish-
ings.  But this conveys but an imperfect idea of what the
yearly rental will soon be.  For the farm of Loncarty, which
contains about five hundred acres, rents only at eighty guin-
eas, and there are other farms in a similar situation.  The
Duke of Athol's tacks have been lately set for twenty two
years, but the most of Colonel Graham's are nearly expired.
The detached part of the parish, which runs along the
Grampians, is not remarkable for any thing but its blue

the Easdale slates, are very durable.  There are two kinds,
a light and dark blue; the last is generally preferred.
   There is no other church than the established one; and
the various sects of seceders, burgers, relief and indepen-

parish.  The manse and church were built within these
twenty years; and though both are more elegant than the

estimating the victual at the usual conversion, is scarce eighty
pounds; it is probable, however, it will soon be augmented.
There were originally three chapels depending on the Ab-
bacy of Scone, with a glebe annexed to each, but were
sometime after the Reformation erected into one parish,
which afterwards took its name from the centrical one,
Redgorton.  Two of the glebes are contiguous to the pre-
