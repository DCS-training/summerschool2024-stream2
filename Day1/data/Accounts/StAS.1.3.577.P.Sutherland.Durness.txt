called Westmoine; with the tract denominated Strathmore,
and intersected by the river Hope.  It forms a part of the coun-
ty of Sutherland, of the presbytery of Tounge, and of the sy-
nod of Caithness and Sutherland.  The greatest length of the
parish is computed to be 15 miles, and the greatest breadth,
13.

   Surface and Scenery.-The scenery of this parish is mostly
wild and mountainous.  Considerable tracts are occupied by
mosses.  Towards the shore, howevers, where the peninsula
terminates in Far-out-head, there is a series of beautiful fields,
and rich green pasture.  On the sides of the hills, too, upon
spots where shields have been occasionally erected, to shelter
the shepherds, in summer and harvest, when feeding their
stocks at a distance from their ordinary dwellings, the sward
is richly variegated with clover, daisies, and other valuable
grasses and wild flowers.  Loch-Borley, a lake which is a
full quarter of a mile in length, and about two thirds as
much in breadth, lies in the middle of the peninsula of Dur-
ness.  A small river falls into the Bay of Durness, and the
river Hope holds its course upon the east side of Loch Erri-
boll.  Along the shore, a tract of flat land extends, in some
places, to the very verge of the ocean; in others, there is a
considerable extent of bare sands; at the head lands, piles od
rocks tower to a vast height.

   Shores and Tides.-The shores are almost every where rocky,
barren, and even destitute of vegetables.  In Loch Erriboll, and
indeed in some creeks, red-ware, or sea-weed, is produced
in such quantity, as to afford, yearly, 10 or 12 tons of kelp;
and on the shores, upon both sides of Far-out-head, great
quantities of this weed are driven in by the waves, and used
for manure by the possessors of the adjoining lands.  Great
