            NUMBER I.

       PARISH OF JEDBURGH.

  From Materials furnished by the Rev. Dr. THOMAS SOMER-
                 VILLE Minister of Jedburgh.

     Origin of the Name.

IN a charter granted by William the Lyon of Scotland, to
the abbot and monks of Jedburgh, in the year 1165*,
the names of Jedwarth and Jedburgh are promiscuously
used; but in modern times the name of Jedburgh alone is
retained.  The name is sometimes written with a G; and is
said to be derived from the Gadeni, a tribe who antiently in-
habited the whole tract of country that lies between Nor-
thumberland and the river Tiviot.  It was perhaps the capi-
tal city belonging to the tribe, and hence obtained the name
of Gadburgh or Jedburgh.
