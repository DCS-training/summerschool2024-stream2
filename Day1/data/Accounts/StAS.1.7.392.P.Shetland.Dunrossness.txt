to the north.  The arable grounds are chiefly by the sea-
shore, and on the margins of the creeks, which on all sides
run up into the country.  On these grounds barley and oats
are raised; large fields of potatoes are also planted, which are
of great benefit to this country.  Cabbages, turnips, carrots,
and other kitchen stuffs, are to be found in the gardens of
the Zetlanders, in the same abundance as on the continent of
Scotland.  No grass seeds are sown in this parish; but it is
remarkable, that on the sandy grounds, when properly pro-
tected from cattle, natural crops of clover and rye-grass

kingdom.-No trees are to be seen in this region, excepting
a few shrubby, roan trees, and willows in the more sheltered
valleys.  The spray of the sea, which is blown over the whole
country by the westerly winds, forms a natural obstacle to
the success of plantations.  The force and duration of the
tempests from the west, are among the most striking features
of a Zetland winter; and if to these are added, the thunder

of the heavens, although they have less of frost and snow
than the inhabitants of wider countries.

   Minerals.-There are many mineral springs in this parish,
as in other districts of Zetland, which bear the appearance of
iron-ore.  Near the island of Whalsey, which lies to the east-
ward, mariners have observed, that the compass reels, and
cannot fix as usual to a point, which is believed to be owing
to the attraction of iron-mines in that place.  In the years
1789 and 1790, Zetland was visited by some gentlemen from
London, who found on the estate of Quendal a rich iron-
mine; and, in various parts of the islands, the ores of copper,
