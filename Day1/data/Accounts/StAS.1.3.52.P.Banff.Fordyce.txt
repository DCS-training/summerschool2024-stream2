constant employment in Lord Findlater's works; and a con-
siderable number of lint-dressers dispersed into different
parts upon the failure of the thread manufactory at Portsoy,
a few years ago.

   Cultivation and Produce, etc.-Horse ploughing has in
some farms superseded the use of oxen; sheep have greatly
decreased by winter herding, and the wearing out of the
commons by tillage and much seat.  A great deal of oats
and barley, and also a considerable quantity of wheat, are
raised in this parish, especially since the erection of flour-
mills.  Almost every farmer has fields of turnip and pota-
toes; the last are sometimes sold for exportation.  The cul-
ture of field cabbage and coleworts is likewise coming into
practice.  The parish does surely more than supply itself
with provisions, though there is, no doubt, a considerable
importation of meal and flesh at Portsoy, from other pa-
rishes; yet that must be more than balanced by exportation.
Almost all the farmers raise flax for their own use, and some of
them for sale; while others let their land for a crop to the
flax-raisers at Portsoy.  The sowing of grass-seeds has be-
come very general.  The rage of ploughing and raising corn
had long ago destroyed the natural best pastures of the pa-
rish, except a few on the sides of burns and rising grounds,
which could not be lately touched by the plough.  There
are, however, still remaining in some parts of the parish,
what they call outfields, which may be called pasture, as
they do not undergo the culture of the plough, except for
two or three crops in a dozen or twenty years.  The use
of lime has much diminished the quantity of out-field.
Wheat is generally sown in the end of harvest, pease,
beans, oats, and barley, are sown from the beginning of
