much that most of them can speak it tolerably.  But it is to
be regretted, that they adulterate their native forcible lan-
guage with Anglicisms, which produce a disagreeable medley.

   Morals.-The people of this parish have been, since the
present incumbent's admission, as regular, on the whole, as
any on the Western Coast.  Indeed, he has observed, that,
not only within his own parish, but within the bounds of the
presbytery in general, there has been, since his first acquaint-
ance with them, a very remarkable change to the better, in
one very important part of duty, namely, in their attendance
on, and decent behaviour at public worship, and at all religious
ordinances.  Most of them are likewise docile and fond of in-
struction:  And few people are less subject to religious divi-
sions.  A tincture of enthusiasm indeed, never before known,
began of late years, to infect a certain corner within the
bounds of this presbytery, and to spread its baneful influence
among a few individuals in the adjacent parish; but, by every
appearance, it is now on the decline.  The inhabitants, in
general, are rational in their religion; sober, with a very few
exceptions; laborious and industrious:  The gentlemen are
well-bred, polite, discreet and hospitable.

   The writer of this article cannot conclude without expressing
his sentiments, in common with his brethren of this district,
concerning the severe and impolitic duty on coals; which has
hitherto retarded every species of improvement in this coun-
try, and amounted, indeed, to an absolute prohibition of its
engaging in any manufactures.  But now that the tax is taken
off, the most happy consequences may be prognosticated, to
the prosperity of the West Coast of Scotland, and the High-
lands in general, both in point of cultivation and manufactures.
