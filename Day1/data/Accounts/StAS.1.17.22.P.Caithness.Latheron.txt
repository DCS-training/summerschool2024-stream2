     Statistical Account

ful.  The stations are Dunbeath and Clyth.  It is commonly
about the beginning or middle of July, before they appear
in such shoals as to induce the fishermen to shoot their nets.
This fishing continues to the beginning, or even the middle of
September.  The lobster fishing only commenced last spring,
(1793), and such numbers do they catch, that many of them
die before the smacks take them away, the chests being so
full.  The stations are Dunbeath and Lybster.  Two Eng-
lish companies have sent boats and crews to fish this season.
The inhabitants propose to carry on the lobster fishing a-
gainst next season.  These companies have a concern in the
cod and herring fisheries.  There are from 40 to 50 boats
of different sizes in the parish.

   Proposed Harbours, etc.- In order to improve the fisheries
on this coast, nothing would be of greater importance than
having two or three good harbours.  Dunbeath and Lybster
seem to be the places best calculated for this purpose.  Some-
thing might also be done at Clyth and Berrindale, at a mo-
derate expence.  It would likewise be of advantage to get some
fishermen to settle from other parts, and to have the present
fishers confined to a house and garden, instead of labouring
small tacks, as they do at present, which makes the fishing
but a secondary consideration with them.

   Population.-As the records have not been regularly kept,
the antient state of the population cannot be precisely ascer-
tained.  This much, however, is pretty certain, that there
are nearly double the number of inhabitants now, that there
were about 70 years ago, when Mr Andrew Sutherland, the
then incumbent, obtained an augmentation to his living.
