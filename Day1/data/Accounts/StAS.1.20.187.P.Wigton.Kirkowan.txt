and on the north and west, by that division of Ayrshire
called Carrick.

   Rivers.-The river Bladenoch runs along the north-east
side of this parish, and forms a natural boundary between it
and the parish of Penningham.  This river rises from a
lake called Loch Macbeary, situated mostly between the
two parishes of Kirkowen and Penningham; but a small
part of it extends beyond the Galloway march, into Car-
rick.  There are several small islands in it, upon the lar-
gest of which are the remains of a considerable building,
and small garden; but, at present, these islands are famous
only as the habitation of some eagles, which have chosen
them as a place of safety.  The river, which has its source
in this lake, runs in a south-east direction for about two-
thirds of its length, after which it takes a more easterly
course, and empties itself into the Bay of Wigton.  Its
whole length, abstracting from the windings of teh river, is
about 24 miles.  Tarf is another river, on the south-west
side of the parish, which rises from a bog in Carrick, which,
after a course of about 12 miles, crosses the parish to the 
eastward, and joins Bladenoch a little to the south-east of
this church.
 
   Roads.-The military road from Carlisle to Port-Patrick
crosses the parish, about 2 miles to the northward of the pa-

since an act of Parliament was passed for converting the sta-
tute-labour of the county into money.  This act has alrea-

still more beneficial.

   Soil.-The surface of this district is various, consisting of
moorlands interspersed with plots of arable; but the greatest
