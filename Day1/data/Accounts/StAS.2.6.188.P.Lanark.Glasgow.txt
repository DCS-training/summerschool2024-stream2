	The stipend of the minister of the Cathedral Church (St Mungo
or Inner High) is paid in victual from teind (converted into mo-
ney,) * viz. 12 1/2 chalders of meal; 12 1/2 chalders of barley; L. 30 in
money; and a glebe, which has been feued under the authority of
Parliament. This stipend, when grain is at a moderate price,
amount to about L. 500. It is very remarkable, that the stipend
of the Barony parish, with the largest population in Scotland, was
only 2000 merks Scots, (L.111, 2s, 2 2/5d.) till 22d February 1815,
when the Court of Teinds raised it to 22 chalders of victual, and
L. 30 in money. The glebe was afterwards authorized to be feued.
When the Gorbals parish was erected on 20th February 1771, the
stipend was L. 90. It has since been incresed to L. 300.
	Church Accommodation.--In 1831, the population of the city
and suburbs, as before stated, was 202,426, and the total sittings in
the various place of worship in the city and suburbs 73,425; viz.
in the Established Church, 30,928; Seceders, Dissenters, Episco-
palians, and Roman Catholics, 42,497. This is in the proportion

<FOOTNOTE>His Majestry's Justice of the Peace the County of Lannark, taking into their
consideration that, by act 4th and 5th William IV. cap, 49, all measures are
repealed; and that in Scotland, on 1st January 1835, the fiar prices of all grain in
every county, for ascertaining the value of ministers' stipens, teinds, &c. shall be
struck by the imperial quarter, it therefore becomes necessary to know how many im-
perial brushels and parts of a bushel are equal to a Linlithgow wheat chalders, and an
oat and barley chalder; and having full confidence in the science and skill of Dr Wil-
liam Meiklecham, Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Glasgow; Dr
Thomas Thomson, Professor Chemistry in said University; and Dr. Jales Cle-
land of Glasgow, Fellow of the Statistical Society of London, the meeting appointed
the said gentlemen aforesaid.
	After mature investigation, commensurate to the importance of the remit, they re-
ported inter alia.
