more trouble than sea ware, and having failed the only time
it was tried, owing to a mistake in the quantity laid on, and
the nature of the soil on which it was put.  To people who

maintain, that this valuable kind of manure is preferable to

banks of another kind of sand, which is used in making win-

1 boat by way of trial.  In 1789, 2 boats were employed,
and every year since, from 5 to 8.  But their success has, by

owing partly to the want of large failing boats, which would
