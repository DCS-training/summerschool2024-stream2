of plantations in different parts of the parish.

   Heritors, Town, Schools, Poor, etc.-There are 8 larger,
and above 100 smaller heritors, who are called portioners,
and who mostly reside in the parish.  Mr Cunningham of
Lainshaw is patron.  The roof of the church was taken off
in 1772, and the walls heightened; it is now well seated, and

a tolls in the parish, one on the road to Kilmarnock, the
other on the road to Irvine, but none on the road to Glas-
gow, which was made more than 30 years ago.-There are
2 schools in the country part of the parish, and 3 in the
town, in some of which, (besides English), Latin, Greek,

soon be augmented.-The number of weekly pensioners is
6.  They get 1 s.  And there are 20 quarterly, who get
