General Appendix to [Vol. i.

   Banking Companies.-The first banking company establish-
ed here, was that of John M'Adam and Company, which
consisted of 12 members, who carried on that business from
1760 to 1770, with advantage to themselves, and benefit to
the country.  The next was the famous and well known
bank of Douglas, Heron and Company, which commenced in
1769, and continued 'till about the end of 1772.  Upon the
dissolution of that concern, another company was formed,
under the firm of Hunters' and Company, which with a
branch of the Bank of Scotland, now carries on all that busi-
ness in this place.

   Fairs, etc.-There are two market days in the town eve-
ry week, Tuesday and Friday; this last is the principal one.
And we have four fairs in the year, one every quarter.  At
the beginning of each fair, coarse raw woolen cloths, manu-
factured in this, and the neighbouring parishes, are sold to
merchants from Glasgow, Paisley, etc. to the amount of
L. 4000 or upwards yearly, at the four fairs.  At three of
them, when the cloth market is over, is a large horse mar-
ket, chiefly of Irish horses.
   In a sea-port town, many as usual, addict themselves to a
sea-faring life, also some inlist in the army, and many young
men go abroad to push their fortunes.  But no emigrations
took place, even when they were most in fashion.
   The people in general are humane and charitable, live
comfortably, and are contented with their circumstances.
Their morals in many instances have suffered by the practice
of smuggling, which is not yet entirely suppressed in this
place; and it is not to be doubted but their condition might
be ameliorated, chiefly by an inerease of true piety, and vir-
tue, and honest industry among them.
