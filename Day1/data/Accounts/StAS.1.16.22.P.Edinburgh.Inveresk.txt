   The number of registered baptisms has been, at an average
for seven years preceding this year, (1793,) not quite 183,
which, multipled by 26, gives only 4758, a number far
below that of the actual enumeration at this time.

   THE BAPTISMS, MARRIAGES and DEATHS, during those
years, were as below:

in the towns is much increased, and there are many handsome houses,
where there were only cottages before, yet sereral of these must have been
demolished, to make room for one good house; as the towns are likewise
much resorted to in summer for sea-bathing, there are many good houses,
which are not more than half inhabited in winter.  There is ground to
believe, that this parish was nearly as populous last century as it is now,
because it is certain, that at that time, when every person arrived, at a ma-
ture age, was obliged to communicate, there were 3000 communicants
in the parish.  In those days there were some small, but populous
villages scattered about, and many small farms that are now no more.
This applies to the first part of this century likewise; for, on an average
of the burials for 12 years, from 1717 to 1728, there died annually 159,
which multiplied by 36, produces 5724; whereas from 1769 to 1780 in-
clusive, the average was only 121, which produces 4356.  This last
period, however, was probably that of the lowest population, as all the
small farms were abolished, and the distelleries, starch-works, etc. were
not introduced, adn few coa-pits were open.  The number of baptisms
does dot form so just a rule of computation as that of deaths, as many
children die without baptism, and not a few of the sectaries than entering
the names of their children in the register, which affords a good reason
for abolisbing a tax that is so little productive.
