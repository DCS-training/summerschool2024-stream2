     of Achterarder.

   The village of Auchterarder labours under the disad-
vantage of not having a constant supply of water.  The
stream which runs through it being brought a considerable
way from the town, is dry in the summer-season; and the
greatest part of the inhabitants are then obliged to bring
their water from an inconvenient distance.  Pit-wells have
been sunk in different parts of the town, but without suc-
cess.  A proposal has been lately made for bringing in
pipes of the Honourable Proprietor of the estate of Perth is
requisite, as the spring lies in his ground; this, with his pe-
cuniary aid, has been solicited, and both it is hoped will be
granted: The advantage to the town in general, and to
his feuars in particular, would be unspeakable.  But without
the assistance of others, the inhabitants are unable themselves
to accomplish so expensive a work, as to bring water, even
in wooden pipes, from the fountain-head to the bottom of
the town, which is a distance of nearly 2 miles.
