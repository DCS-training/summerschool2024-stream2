   Minerals, Fuel, Inns, etc.-The E. end of the parish a-
bounds with inexhaustible quarries of excellent freestone,
very fit for either building or mill-stones.-This parish was
once abundantly accommodated with peats for fuel; but,the
mosses are now almost exhausted, and many of the country
people are necessitated to purchase coals.-There is but one
inn or public house in the parish.  It lies on the county road
from Elgin to Forres, which passes through Alves.

   Heritors and Rent.-The heritors are, the Earl of Moray;
the Earl of Fife; William Brodie of Windyhills, Esq.; Peter
Rose Watson of Callsield, Esq.; Miss Brodie of Lethen; John
Spence Munro of Kirktown, Esq.; and George Forteath of
Newton, Esq.-two of whom only have their residence in
the parish.  It is not pretended to give an accurate statement
of the real rent, as that must depend upon the price of grain;
but, at an average, it may be estimated at upwards of 3000 L.
Sterling per annum.  Land, in general, here lets at from 20 s.
to 30 s. per Scotch acre.  The rents are paid, partly in mo-
ney, and partly in grain; that is, oats, at 5 firlots per boll,
and barley.

   Pupolation*.-By every information, the population of
this parish is very considerably diminished.  This is still far-
ther confirmed, by comparing the return to Dr. Webster in

with the present population, in 1793,               1111
Which shews an evident decrease+, within these 50
   years, of                                         580
