<FOOTNOTE>Dr. Parnell's elaborate contributions to the Memoirs of the Royal and Wernerian
Societies, (see Vol. xiv. of the former, and Vol. vii. of the latter,) on the fishes inha.
biting or frequenting the Firth of Forth, form one of the most valuable additions to
the zoology of Scotland within the last fifty years. Thousands of persons never ima-
gined that the Forth possessed any other kinds of fish than the eight or ten seen in our
markets, salmon, cod, haddock, herring, skate, flounder, eel, smelt, &c. It will
surprise such persons to learn that this arm of the sea contains no less than 125 spe-
cies, of which 40 were not known to exist in it until they were discovered by this
enthusiastic young naturalist, and six had not been previously recorded by any
writer, as frequenting the British seas.
             The sword-fish has been occasionally found here; but is rare in our seas, its pro-
per habitation being the Mediterranean.
             A large specimen of this very deformed fish (which is also named frog-fish, toad.
fish, and sea-devil,) was captured here on the 20th September 1837. It is rare on
our coasts.
             Pikes were introduced into Gartmorn dam several years ago, much to the in-
jury of the other fishes. One was captured there last season, weighing 16 lbs., and
one some years ago of 24 lbs. weight.
             In tbe Old Statistical Account, these fishes are called gaudenooks, or Egyptian
herrings; and when it was written, were said to be a great help to many poor peo-
ple. During the last thirty years, very few of them have been seen here.
             The Lochleven and some other species of trout were introduced into Gartmorn
dam, soon after its formation. Dr Parnell's learned communication to the Royal
Society (Transact. Vol. xiv. pp. 9 and 10,) contains an interesting account of this sin.
ngular species, and of the much disputed par.
             A sturgeon, which weighed 180 lbs., was captured here in 1823.
             Of the thornback or thorny skate, a gigantic specimen was taken in the yair
at Alloa, on the 25th of November 1777. The following account of it is taken from
the handwriting of the late worthy Alexander Bald, Esg. Senior.

	                     WEIGHT.
	The (total) weight, 18 stone, 7 lb., 940 pts. Dutch.
        The weight of the estable part, 8 stone, 0 lbs., 152 pts.
        The weight of the head and tail, 2 stone, 7 lbs.
