     The Statistical Account.

   If, in such situations, he can obtain possession of no more
land than a mere legal glebe, it is evident, from what has
been already stated, at what disadvantage he must farm it;
how dear his accommodation must stand to the clergyman;
how dear to the public, from the idle expence of labour in
effecting nothing, which if properly applied might have been
highly productive.
   If the glebe is properly inclosed and subdivided; I should
apprehend that the most profitable mode of occupancy,
would be to lay out the whole in grass; and, alternately, to
pasture the different fields for a season; and to close them
up for hay after having all the winter's dung spread upon
them as a top dressing in spring.  The cattle kept would be
merely one horse, which would perform no work but the
carrying out of the dung to the field to be allotted for hay;
and to carry in the hay; the other cattle would be milk
cows.  The only expence of servants would be an house-
maid and assistant girl.  The fuel must be hired in Pro-
bably it might be necessary to buy in yearly a quantity of
fodder, and certainly some straw for litter to the cattle-if
any part of the glebe could be converted into water meadow,
it would greatly add to the winter provision of fodder, al-
lowing all the dung to be laid upon a different field for hay
This scheme however necessarily implies, that the carriage
of fuel can be procured for hire.
   A still better resource (where attainable) would be to rent
a small quantity of land lying contiguous; which, in con-
junction with the glebe, might constitute the requisite size
of farm taken notice of (p. 400.)  It is however, evident,
that no legal arrangement can possibly be formed to secure
clergymen, in such situations, in the requisite size of farm.
Neither does there exist any stable motive of interest to se-
cure such voluntary arrangement on the part of any of the
