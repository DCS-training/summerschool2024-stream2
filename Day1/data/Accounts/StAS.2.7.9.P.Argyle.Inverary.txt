  Chlorite rock occurs frequently; masses of it are strewn over
the mountains, and it is found in beds of great extent. Sometimes
it appears very soft, so as to yield to the tools of the carpenter, and
feels soapy, showing that it is passing into talc slate. Beds of this
description are frequent, and the Duke of Argyle's Castle is built
of it. As a building stone, its only fault seems to be its liabi-
lity to crack. It is not otherwise affected by the weather, and oil
prevents this defect from amounting to any serious evil.
  The soil near the shore consists, for the most part, of a thin
light loam on a gravelly bottom; at the base of the mountainr
in the valleys, and especially in Glenshira, it is a deep and dark
loam on a sandy or clayey bottom; and much of it is moss with
a small quantity of earth washed down from the higher soils, oc-
casionally mingled with it near the surface. The plants which
these soils yield, depend much upon their elevation above the sea,
but in general, the first ma be said to yield species of Anemone,
Hyacinthus, Cynosurus, Phleum, Leontodon, Rhinanthus, &c.;
the second, species of Trifolium, Plantago, Bellis, Alopecurus,
Poa, &c.; and the third, species of Scirpus, Carex, Juncus, Vac-
cinium, Eriophorum, &c.
