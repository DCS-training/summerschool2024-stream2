     1. HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY BEFORE THE REFOR-
     MATION.

   Origin.-At the request of King JAMES II. Pope NICOLAS
V. granted a Bull, constituting a "studium generale, tam in
"theologia, et in jure canonum et civili, guam in artibus, et
"in quacunque licita facultate," to continue in all time to
come in the city of Glasgow; as being a notable place, and fit
for the purpose, by the temperature of the air, and the plenty
of all kinds of provisions for human life: and, by his apostoli-

students shall enjoy all the privileges, liberties, honours, ex-

his city of BONONIA.  He likewise appointed WILLIAM TURN-
BULL, then bishop of Glasgow, and his successors in that see,
to be the rectors, called chancellors, of the said studium; and
to have the same authority over the doctors, masters, and

Bull is dated at Rome the 7th of the month of January 1450,
and the fourth year of his pontificate.

   Establishment.-By the care of the bishop and his chapter,
a body of statutes was prepared, and an university established,
in the year I451: consisting, besides the chancellor, of a rec-

their degrees in other universities; and students, who, after a
course of study and examination, prescribed by their several
faculties, might be promoted to academical degrees.-That
this institution might open with the greater celebrity, the bi-
shop had procured and published a Bull from the Pope, grant-

visit the cathedral church of Glasgow, in the year I451.-We
