of red, and four pounds of white clover seed sown on an acre,
return 200 stones of hay.
   Oats are sown about the middle of March.  Barley about
the beginning of May.  Beans about the first of March.
   Oats and beans are reaped about the middle of September.
Barley about the latter end of August.
   When wheat is sown on the dryfield lands, which is not
generally done, the preparation, excepting two plowings, is
the same as in the carses.
   The carse land is too wet during winter, for the profitable
cultivation of turnips; they are sometimes sown on the dry-
fields.
   A few potatoes are planted by almost every farmer, whe-
ther in the carses or in the dryfields.  Three bolls planted on
an acre return about sixty bolls.  A little flax also is generally
sown after potatoes.  Twelve pecks of lintfeed sown on an
acre, return thirty six stones of lint from the mill.  Diffe-
rent kinds of ploughs are used.  The price also varies from 12 s.
to L. 2:12 s:6 d.  Two horses are usually put to a plough;
and are sufficient to cultivate a farm of thirty acres.
   It need hardly be added, that these statements have been
made at an average, and must frequently and considerably
vary according to the circumstances of particular seasons, and
of different farmers.

   Roads.-Seven miles of the great turnpike road from Edin-
burgh to Stirling, five or six miles of the turnpike road from
Stirling to Glasgow, about twelve miles of the road from
Dunbarton to the ferry near Alloa, lie in this parish.  All our
roads and bridges are kept in excellent repair by the attention
of the country gentlemen.  The expences are defrayed by the
produce of the tolls, or of the statute labour.
