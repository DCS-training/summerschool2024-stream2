which in this parish would be near 40 per cent.  of the rent.
   Add to these, the very material difference in the expen-
diture for farming utensils, manures, and improvements, the
material deficiency in the article of manure, together with
the prodigious public loss*, which would result from the uni-
versal adoption of the modern plan of using horses instead
of oxen.
   These circumstances shew, that the introduction of the
more approved plans of husbandry would not, in a pecunia-
ry view, be so advantageous to the proprietors as might at
first be imagined.  And indeed it is a well known fact, that
very distant as farms in this part of the country most un-
questionably are from improvement, yet that from the incon-
siderable necessary expence of an intrant tenant, the average
rent of some of them equals that of some in the county of
Essex.
   But other circumstances have contributed to that back-
wardness in agricultural improvement, too evident in this
and the neighbouring parishes.
   Before any persons can be induced to deviate from esta-
blished practice, they must have access to observe the supe-
rior advantages of a new system; they must have the prospect
of reaping the fruits of that system by long leases; and also
(as already observed) a sufficient stock to enable them to per-
severe until their farms are brought to proper heart.
   The farmers of this parish have never had the advantage
of the first of these.  It is true, the proprietors have occa-
sionally introduced the improvements of modern husbandry,
but from the efforts of proprietors as examples, the peasantry
never will act.  These generally improve more for pleasure
