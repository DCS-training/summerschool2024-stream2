     of Durris.

   There are no manufacturers, strictly speaking, in the parish.
The women and children make a great many hose, but are not
fond of spinning lint.  There is one Roman Catholic, one
Episcopalian; all the rest are of the established church.
There is no map of the parish; but there is one of the
county by Mr Garden.  He makes the number of acres in
this parish 13,309 Scots, 16,912 English.-About a quarter
of a mile below the church, on the north side of the Aber-
deen road, there is a little hill, called the Castle-hill.  It has
formerly been a place of some strength.  Places on the top,
where cannon have been planted, are very visible.  There is
a pretty deep ditch round the foot of it, on the east, south,
and west.  A stream of water, coming from a neighbouring
hill, can easily be brought to fill the ditch.
