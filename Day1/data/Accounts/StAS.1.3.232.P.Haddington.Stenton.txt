free stone quarries, which are to be found almost in every
field.

   Productions.-The crops are the same as elsewhere in East-
Lothian.  The grain is in general good; but, in Lammer-
moor and its confines, the corn is of a very inferior quality.
Fortunately, in that bleak country, they depend little upon
corn crops; their sheep farms are their chief support.  The 
passion for the tornip crop seems to grow in this part of the
country, and is perhaps justified by its success.

   Population.-The numbers in this parish, by an accurate
list just now made up, are 624 souls.  In Dr Webster's re-
port, the number is 631.  For the last 10 years the average
of baptisms was   14
   marriages       3
   burials         7

   Poor.-Without the aid of assessments, the poor of this
parish are well provided for; the trustees, at same time,
take care, that every individual shall do the best he can, for
supporting himself, and no encouragement is given to idle-
ness.  They have a capital of about L. 500 , most of which 
has been bequeathed at different times by individuals of the
family of Beild.  The collections, added to the interest of this
capital, afford the poor a decent and comfortable supply.
The poor here are under no temptation, and indeed, they
receive no encouragement to beg, because they are aware of
the consequence, that they should thereby be cut off from
all parochial aid.  But, though there are no vagrants from
this parish, the country is perpetually harrassed, and perhaps
never more so than at present, by stranger beggars, who pour
in from all quarters, and greatly distress the honest and in-
dustrious.
