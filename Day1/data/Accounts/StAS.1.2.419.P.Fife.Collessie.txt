ders in his name, and thus made the castle hold out, until the
enemy raised the siege.-In the middle of this ruin, there
are two stones fixed in the ground, (covering, it is supposed,
human bones,) but of no very remarkable size.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The number of the greater he-
ritors, is 12; of whom 6 reside in the parish.  There are also
a number of feuers, or smaller proprietors.-There are
no turnpikes; but the roads and bridges, in general, are in good
repair.  The rent of the best arable land is, at an average, be-
tween 30 and 40 s. the acre; the next best about 20 s.-The
number of ploughs may be about 60.-There are only 3
slocks of sheep, the largest of which belongs to Lord Leven.
-A considerable part of the parish is inclosed, and
inclosures are going forward.-The common fuel is coals,
brought about 6 miles from Balbirnie, or Balgonie.-
The schoolmaster's salary is about L. 8 Sterling, with a dwell-
ing house, school house, and a small garden; and the dues
paid him by his scholars, who, at an average, are about 40 in
number.  The poor who get supplies, either statedly or occa-
sionally, are about 10.  The only funds, for their relief, are,
the collections at the church doors, amounting, at an average,
to L. II. or L. 12 yearly, and a mortification from the Rossie
family of a boll of meal per annum.-Upon the prospect
of a war, many of our young men have shewn themselves
ready to serve their country, both by sea and land.  None have
been under the necessity of emigrating from this parish, for
want of employment, and none have died of want.
