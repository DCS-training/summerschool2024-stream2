are like small spots of rich verdure; and, though distant, near
30 miles, seem quite near, and under the beholder.  The low
parts of Jura, cannot be discerned, nor any part of Isla; far
less, the coast of Ireland, which some have pretended to see
from the top of Benevis.  Such, however, is the wide extent
of view, from the summit of this mountain, that it reaches
170 miles, from the horizon of the sea, at the Murray Frith, on
the north east, to the island of Colunsa, on the south west.
Could one pass a night, in October, on the summit of Bene-
vis, it is probable, that he would discover the heavenly bo-
dies in greater splendour, than upon Mount Blanc itself.  The
latter, it is true, is much higher; but the the former, is in a
colder climate, and consequently, when fair, in a less shaded
sky.
   The high hills on each side of the lakes and rivers, men-

hand, yield a curious variety of agreeable wild prospects; the
vast windings whereof make the several turnings of the
mountains rather diversify the scene, than obstruct the eye.
Their extremities, declining gradually from their several
summits, open into vallies; where one has variegated views of
woods, rivers, plains, and lakes.  The torrents of water,
which, here and there, tumble down the precipices, and, in
many places, break through the cracks and cliffs of the rocks,
arrest the eye, and suspend the mind, in awful astonish-
ment.  In a word, the number, the extent, and the variety of
the several prospects,-the irregular wildness of the hills, of the
rocks, and of the precipices,-the noise of rivulets, and of
torrents, breaking and foaming among the stones, in such a di-
versity of shapes and colours,-the shining smoothness of the
seas, and of the lakes,-the rapidity, and rumbling of the ri-
vers, falling from shelve to shelve, and forcing their streams
through a multitude of obstructions,-the serenity of the
