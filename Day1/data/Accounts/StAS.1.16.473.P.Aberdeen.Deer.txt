   Rearing of cattle has, for these ten or twelve years past,
been the most lucrative part of the farming business, great
numbers having been bought by drovers for the English
market, A couple of oxen sells at from L. 10 to L. 20
Sterling.  Sufficient attention, however, has not been paid
to the breed.  The breed of horses has been much impro-
red of late years, by means of itinerant stallions, and their
value is generally double that of oxen.  The number of
black cattle in the parish may be estimated at 3400; the
number of horses at 700.

   Produce.-About 20,000* bolls of grain are raised an-
nually in this parish, of which one-fifth may be barley.  It
is supposed, that 4000 bolls of meal and grain are in ordi-
nary years exported.  Oat-meal sells at from 10 s. to 16 s.
per boll of 8 stones Dutch.  Bear-meal is of one-fourth less
value.  No less than 3000 bushels of malt, according to
the excise-books, are annually made, and as the bear of
this country is inferior in weight to that of the more sou-
thern counties, the price of malt is seldom more than 4 s.
above the price of oat-meal current at the time.  Sixteen
hogsheads of lintseed, mostly American, are sown annually
in this parish.  This is reckoned sufficient for 36 acres;
and the produce, on an average, does not much exceed
1000 stones of scutched flax.  The tenant of one of the
lint-mills has, for several years past, received the greatest
premium for raising flax of any in the county.  Hay is sold
at 6 d. per stone, equal to 20 lb.  Dutch.  An acre of tur-
nips, when carried off the field, fetches L. 4 Sterling.  Po-
tatoes are universally cultivated, and sell at 5 d. or 6 d.
per peck, of 2 stones Dutch.  Cabbages are planted in the
