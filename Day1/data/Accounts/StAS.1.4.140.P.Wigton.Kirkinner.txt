the town of Wigton.  Between this parish Sorbie and
Glasserton, on the S. W. lies the lake or loch of Dowal-
ton, about 2 miles long, by 1 1/2 broad, containing pike and
herring; and a little island on the Kirkinner side of it, a-
bout 30 acres arable.  I wish I could fee it stocked with
Shetland sheep.  The extent of waste ground along the frith
of Cree, is about 3 miles.  A few small cod and haddocks,
skate and foals, are taken there, and sold in the market of
Wigton, from 1 d. to 1 1/2 d. 2 pound.  None exported.  The
hills were formerly covered with furze or broom, now

gray whinstone, used in building, principally for doors,
corners, and windows.

   Population, etc.-With respect to the ancient population,
little is known.  It is to be observed, however, that there
have been many houses, where now there are none, and
probably the tenements of land, as they were called, were
smaller, and more numerous; consequently this parish,
wherein, to this day, there is not a village, might perhaps
be more populous than it now is, at least than it was 10 or
12 years ago.  From the register of births, for 10 years.
down, from 1695 inclusive, the average was between 23
and 24; for the 10 following years, it is between 28 and
29.  After that, the register begins to have been ill kept,
down to the 1734; of which year, and the five following,
the average of births is not quite 24.  From that time,
down to the year 1782, the register has been so ill kept,
that it cannot be depended on.  The annual average of
births since that year, appears to be very nearly 29.  Ac-
cording to Dr Webster's returns, the number was 792.
The present population is 1152; makes 563; females,
589.  No register of deaths has ever been kept.  But from
