there were above 20 or 25 religious at a time; but the ordi-
nance bears, that sums appointed for buying provisions that
year exceeded the appointments for the year 1528, notwith-
standing the king's highness had been there twice, and the
archbishop thrice; so that the great as well as the poor felt
the fruits of their hospitality.
   The privileges of the convent were extended even to
England; for there is still extant, although much spoiled,
an original charter of king John, under his seal, exempting
them a thelonio et confustudinee in all parts of England, London
excepted.
   The abbey was all inclosed with a strong wall, the ground
forming an oblong square, the length from north to south
about 190 geometrical paces, and the mean breadth from
east to west 113, the breadth on the north end exceeding
the south upwards of one third.  On the S. W. corner is a
tower, which is turned into a.  steeple for the present church
and at the S. E. corner is the Darngate, which, from the
name, appears to have been a private entry; over which was
a house for catechising, and bore that name.  The greatest
part of the walls were standing within the memory of the
present generation, but are now in a great measure demo-
lished.  On the N. of the square, and almost in the middle
betwixt the two corners, stood the abbey church: a stately
Gothic fabric, having a cross near the east end, and two rows
of pillars, one on each side, with the side aisles without the
pillars, from the entry to the cross church.  The length of
the whole is about 275 feet; the breadth of the body and
side aisles 67; the length from the entry to the cross church
150; the length of the cross from N. to S. 165; the breadth
of this last 27.  There were two square steeples on each
side of the entry, surrounded by round pillars on the corners,
one of which Rood entire until the great wind in January
