   The natural curiosity that chiefly deserves notice is the
rock called Craig-grande, or the ugly rock.  This is a deep
chasm or abyss, formed by two opposite precipices that rise
perpendicularly to a great height, through which the Ault-
grande runs for the space of 2 miles.  It begins at the di-
stance of 4 miles from the sea, by a bold projection into the
channel of the river, which it diminishes in breadth by a least
one half.  The river continues to run with rapidity for about
three quarters of a mile, when it is confined by a sudden jut-
ting out of the rock.  Here, the side view from the summit
is very striking.  The course of the stream being thus im-
peded, it whirls and foams, and beats with violence against
the opposing rock, till, collecting strength, it shoots up per-
pendicularly with great fury, and, forcing its way, darts with
the switness of an arrow through the winding passage on the
other side.  After passing this obstruction, it becomes in
many places invisible, owing partly to the increasing depth
and narrowness of the chasm, and partly to the view being
intercepted by the numerous branches of trees which grow
on each side of the precipice.  About a quarter of a mile far-
ther down, the contry people have thrown a slight bridge,
composed of trunks of trees covered with turs, over the rock,
where the chasm is about 16 feet wide.  Here the observer,
if he has intrepidity enough to venture himself on such a tot-
tering support, and can look down on the gulph below with-
out any uneasy sensations, will be gratified with a view equal-
ly awful and astonishing.  The wildness of the steep and rug-
ged rocks; the gloomy horror of the cliffs and caverns, "in-
"accessible by mortal's trod," and where the genial rays of
the fun never yet penetrated; the water falls which are heard
pouring down in different places of the precipice, with fonds
various in proportion to their distance, the hoarse and hol-
low murmuring of the river, which runs at the depth of near
