lightful prospect of Gordon Castle, of the river and part
of Murray, of the Murray Frith, and the mountains of
Sutherland and Caithness*.
   Bellie extends from S. to N., near 6 measured miles,
and from E. to W. almost 4.  It is bounded on the N.
by the Murray Frith, and on the W. by the river Spey.
A considerable part of this space, to about 4 miles from
the sea, is contained within the ancient banks of this ri-
ver, which are very high.  What these banks enclose
may be considered as the range or territory of the Spey
at this place, though it has greatly shifted its channels
in different periods.  At Gordon castle, which is be-
tween them, but near that on the E. these banks are
near a mile distant from each other.  They gradually
widen in their approach to the sea, and where the river
falls into the frith, are near 2 miles asunder.  Between
the bank on the E, and the present bed of Spey, is a fine
extensive plain, with many farms, and a great number
of inhabitants, the river having kept near the W. side
for tome immemorial, though it has frequently made
ravages, that have rendered many embankments and
bulwarks requisite.  This bank is for about a mile be-
low Gordon castle, handsomely dressed in imitation of
nature, and adorned by fine plantations of trees and
shrubs, with very pleasant walks.  Here is a very great
number of large clusters of hollies, which have produced
it the appellation of the Holy Bank, as below it is styled

   *All the old names of farms here are of Celtic or Gin, as Dalachy, the plain
field; Auchenrealh, the field of heath; Auchenhalrigg, the field of the spectres or hob-
gobins, etc.  The Gaelic tongue, however, has long disappeared in this part
of the country; the language, in general, being that dialect of English com-
mon to the North of Scotland; though, among all persons who pretend to any
thing like education, the English language is daily gaining ground.
