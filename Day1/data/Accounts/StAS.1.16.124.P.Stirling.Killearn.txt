time it generally acquires the taste.  Salmon kippered in
this manner usually sells 2 d. per lb. higher than when fresh.
   This parish and neighbourhood were, for a long time,
unhappily exposed to the plundering inroads of large com-
panies of migratory freebooters, who for safety lurked in
the borders of the Highlands.  These depredators made
frequent incursions into the parishes of Buchanan, Balfrone,
Killearn, Dumbarton, Kilpatricks, etc. and carried off all
the cattle they could find.  This infamous practice was
continued so late as the year 1743, and perhaps later.
Long before that, however, some gentlemen near the bor-
der of the Highlands, undertook, for certain sums of money,
to protect the property of their neighbours, or to make a
full recompence for what was stolen from them.  The
money paid for this protection was called the Black Mail,
and was paid agreeably to a bargain concluded upon by the
two contracting parties.  One of the original contracts re-
mains in the possession of Mr Dunmore at Ballikinrain.
As this contract is not only a literary curiosity, but is per-
haps the only contract of the kind now existing, and as it
exhibits a true picture of the state of the country so late as
the year 1741, and likewise leads us to form an idea of the
happy alteration that has since taken place, the subjoined
copy of it verbatim will not, it is presumed, be unaccept-
able to the public, especially as the report of the Black
Mail is so generally, yet so imperfectly known*.
