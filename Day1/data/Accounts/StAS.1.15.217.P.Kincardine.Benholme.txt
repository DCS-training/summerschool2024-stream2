     NUMBER XIII.

     PARISH OF BENHOLME.

     (COUNTY OF KINCARDINE, PRESBYTERY OF FORDUN, SY-
     NOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.)

     By the Rev. MR. JAMES SCOTT, Minister.

     Extent and Surface.

   THIS parish is about 3 English miles in length, and near-
ly as much in breadth.  The German Ocean bounds it on
the S. E.  The face of the country is considerably diversified.
Close upon the shore lies a narrow strip of land almost level
with the sea:  Adjoining to this, a bank or rising ground, of
considerable height, extends the whole length of the parish.
Above this ancient boundary of the ocean, which is steep in
some places, and slopes gently in others, the ground rises by
an unequal ascent towards the N. W.  A chain of little
hills, whose summits are covered with heath, run along the
S. W. boundary, and a rising ground, some hundred yards
above the level of the sea, terminates the view on the N. E.
The interior parts of the parish consist of hill and dale.
