ry cheap, and in small quantities, by means of the coal ships,
to many parts in Scotland, and by the vicinity to Leith, to
any foreign port.  There is a branch of the Borrowstounness
custom-house established here for the convenience of the
coasting trade carried on from this port, and from Sir. Davids,
the property of Sir John Henderson, Baronet, of Fordel, and
the shipping place of his great coal works.

   Ecclesiastical State, School, etc.-Sir William Erskine, Ba-
ronet, of Torry, is the patrons having lately purchased the
estate of Spencerfield, to which is annexed the right of pa-
tronage.  The church was repaired and partly rebuilt within
these 20 years.  It is large enough to contain the parishioners.
It is a little singular in outward appearance, being covered
with three roofs of equal dimensions, which are supported
by two rows of arches within, and the two side walls.  It
could easily be made a handsome, commodious, and elegant
church.  Upon the west side, adjoining to it, is the
steeple, which seems to be very ancient, from the appea-
rance of the stones and the form of the building.  The
stipend at present consists of 5 chalders victual, and 500
merks Scots, besides 4 l. Sterling, of what is called vicarage.
The free teinds are considerable: There has been no augmen-
tation since the year 1636, and a process is now carrying on
for that purpose.  There is no manse or garden, but an al-
lowance for house rent is paid by the town and some of the
heritors.  A small house and garden at Rosyth goes by that
name.  There are two glebes and a small park by itself, mak-
ing in all eight acres of excellent ground.  The one is the
glebe of Rosyth, which was annexed to this parish, and lies
adjacent to that old church now in ruins; but it is proposed
to have it exchanged and placed with the other, which is near
the town.
