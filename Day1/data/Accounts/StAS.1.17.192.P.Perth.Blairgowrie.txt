is only about 9 miles long, and from one to two miles broad.
The parish is divided into two districts by a branch of the
Grampian mountains, which is the northern boundary of
this part of the beautiful rainy of Strathmore.  The sou-
thern districts which lies in the strath, is about 4 miles long,
and from one to two miles broad.  In general it is flat.  The
northern district, which includes the detached parts of the
parish, is high ground, very uneven in the surface.  The a-
rable land in it is in general sloping, and, in many places,
very steep.  The hills are mostly covered with heath.  Some
of them may be about 600 feet above the level of the sea.
The soil in both districts, as may be supposed, is various.  A-
long the side of the Illa, it is a deep rich loam, free from
stones.  Immediately north from that, it is a stiff loam upon
a till bottoms wet and spouty.  This last is a prevailing soil
in the parish, and also a light dry earth full of stones, on a
gravel bottom.  In easy places there is a thin stratum of a
light black earth, either upon gravel or cold till.  There are
considerable tracts of hill, muir and moss, and more, than
1000 acres are covered with Wood.  Not above a third part
of the parish consists of arable ground.

   Climate and Diseases.-The climate varies in different parts
of the parish, It is often mild and temperate in the sou-
thern district, while it is sharp and cold in the northern.  A
remarkable difference is felt, on leaving the former to go to
the latter.  In both, however, the air, on the whole is very
salubrious, and the inhabitants are not subject to any pecu-
liar distempers.  Formerly, indeed, the lower part of the pa-
rish was much distressed with the ague, but since some of the
lakes have been drained, than disease has totally disappeared.
The rheumatism is the most common disorder, particularly
among the poorer class of the people, when well advanced
