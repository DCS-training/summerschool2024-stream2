smith in the Crook of Dovan before the Reformation.  At
that time, a Roman Catholic priest officiated in the parish;
who was a great declaimer against the marriage of the
clergy.  The blacksmith, had notwithstanding reason to
suspect that he was too familiar with his wife; and pre-
tending to go on a journey, he returned unexpectedly, and
found the priest and his wife together.  This son of Vulcan,
however, did not, like his predecessor in the case of Mars and
Venus, prepare a net to link them together; but he ham-
mered out a most substantial staple, and indignantly dragging
the priest to the anvil stock, he nailed him to it by means of
the staple, and by that part of his body which had done the
mischief.  He then laid down a knife, and setting fire to the
smith's shop, gave the priest his choice, either "to cut or to
"burn."  The priest hesitated, till the flames approached
him; but was at last obliged to have recourse to the knife.
He never afterwards made his appearance in the parish; and
no other Roman Catholic priest was permitted to succeed
him; the anvil stock, has therefore the name of "the Refor-
"mation Clogg;" and the story is known by the title of "cut
"or burn."  The original clogg itself has been in the pos-
session of the last 5 ministers of the parish; and is now in the
possession of the writer of this account.  This affair is said to
have happened during the time that Mary Queen of Scots was
confined a prisoner in the castle of Lochleven, under the care
of William Douglas, to whom it belonged.

   Natural Curiosities.-In working the lime rock, the work-
men sometimes meet with pieces of it resembling the shells
of sea-fish.  Lately, there was a piece found, exactly si-
milar to a common octavo bible bound in white vellum.
Both from the appearance of leaves, uncut, and from its
cover, every person who has seen it, takes it for a book.
