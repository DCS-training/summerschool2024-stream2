     Statistical Account

   Inclosures, Etc-Part of the estate of Stobo, contiguous
to the house, was inclosed early in this century, to which the
present proprietor has added largely.  The inclosures east
from the manse extend about a mile, and to the west about
two miles, and in depth, from north to south, from half a 
mile to a mile.  The river Tweed is the south boundary.
The fences are quickset hedges, or dry stone walls.  Inclosures
are begun in other parts of the parish, but hitherto they have
made no considerable progress.  There are few full grown
trees in the parish, except in the old inclosures of Stobo,
where there are a good many; and in the new inclosures,
considerable young plantations have been made of all kinds
of trees usually planted in Scotland.  The farmers are in
general sensible of the advantages of inclosures.  One farmer,
upon a three-nineteen years lease, has begun to inclose part
of his farm at his own expence; and others, upon shorter
leases, solicit the aid of their landlords, (who are not averse
to encourage them),to assist them in making small inclosures.

   Productions.-Oats, bear, and pease are the staple crops in
the parish.  Wheat is sown, but in small quantities.  Turnip
is sown by those who have inclosures; and potatoes are
found to be so generally useful, and the soil so well suited to
the growth of them, that they are raised by every person.
Clover and rye-grass are also sown, and some sow as much
slax or lint-feed as is necessary for family uses.  There is 
more grain produced in the parish than is necessary for the
maintainance of its inhabitants.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants, of  which this
parish consisted, preceding the year 1734, is not ascertained.

now much defaced, but are still in the remembrance of old
