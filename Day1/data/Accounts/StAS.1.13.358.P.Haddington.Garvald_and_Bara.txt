high price which horses now bring at market hath induced
the tenants to rear their own horses, and a few for sale.
In this country the price of a draught horse is from L. 25
to L. 30, some higher.  The number of black cattle a-
mounts to 575, consisting chiefly of young and milch-cows.
The tenants breed 2 considerable number, not only to sup-
ply their own demands, but likewise for sale; but this num-
ber cannot be easily ascertained, as it varies every year;
besides these, for many years past upwards of 100 black
cattle have been annually fed on turnip, and sold to the 
butcher.

   Villages.-There are 2 villages in these parishes, Gar-
vald and Baro. The village of Garvald contains 214 in-
habitants.  Within these 14 or 15 years upwards of 30
new houses have been built in this village; but prior to
this period, and even since, almost an equal number of old
ones have been pulled down.  All the new houses (except
2 or 3) are feus at the rate of L.3 the acre, built by ma-
sons, wrights, weavers, etc. In the vicinity of the village
there is a great number of freestone quarries, of an ex-
cellent quality, some of which are only at the distance of
200 yards.  The grounds in this neighbourhood are almost
all enclosed with stones from these quarries.  There are 4
public houses in the village; besides these, there is an inn
or public house at Danskine, on the great road from Had-
dington to Dunfe, and where travellers receive proper accom-
modation.  These, however, have had no bad effect on the 
morals of the people.  Drinking to excess is less prevalent 
here than it was 20 years ago.  The inhabitants of these
parishes, with a very few exceptions, are sober, virtuous,
industrious, and remarkably attentive to their different em-
ployments.  The village of Baro is small, thinly inhabited,
