moss.  The dimensions proper for the drain are found to be
two feet for the breadth and the same for the depth.  If
smaller, it could not conveniently receive the spadefuls of
moss; if larger, the water would escape, leaving the moss
behind.  The drain has an inclination of one foot in 100
yards: tile more regularly this inclination is observed through-
out, the less will the moss be liable to obstructions in its pro-
gress with the water.  The drain being formed, the opera-
tor marks off to a convenient extent along-side of it a sec-
tion of moss 10 feet broad; the greatest distance from which
he can heave his spadeful into the drain.  This he repeatedly
does till the entire mass be removed down to the clay.  He
then digs a new drain at the foot of the moss bank, turns the
water into it, and proceeds as before, leaving the moss to
pursue its course into the river Forth, a receptacle equally
convenient and capacious; upon the fortunate situation of
which, happily forming for several miles the southern boun-
dary of the estate, without the interposition of any neigh-
bouring proprietor, depended the very existence of the whole
operations.
   When the moss is entirely removed, the clay is found to
be encumbered with the roots of different kinds of trees
standing in it as they grew, often very large: their trunks
also are frequently found lying beside them.  All these the
tenants remove, often with great labour.  In the course of
their operations they purposedly leave upon the clay a stratum
of moss six inches thick.  This, in Spring, when the season
offers, they reduce to ashes, which in a great measure ensures
the first crop.  The ground thus cleared is turned over,
where the dryness admits with a plough, and, where too
soft, with a spade.  A month's exposure to the sum, wind,
and frost, reduces the clay to a powder fitting it for the seed
in March and April.  A crop of oats is the first, which sel-
