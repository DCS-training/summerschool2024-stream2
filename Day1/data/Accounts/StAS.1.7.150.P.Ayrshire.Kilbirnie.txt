matisms, inflammatory and nervous fevers; with a few con-
sumptions, and very seldom the putrid fever and sore throat.

   Waters.-There is a-fine loch, about two miles in length,
and near half a mile in breadth, well stored with pike, perch,
trout, and eel.  The late Earl of Crawfurd kept a pleasure-
boat on it; and now there is a collier-boat erected on it,
much more useful, for conveying coals from this to the Beith
side of the loch.
   Garnock is the only river of any consequence, but not na-
vigable.  It rises from the foot of a very high hill in the
muir called the Misty Law, and runs shallow, clear, and
dimpling beautifully down the hills southward, and almost
divides the parish into two halves, circulating the lower
grounds on the south-east side; and then holding on its
course through Dalry and Kilwinning, enlarging as it flows,
until near Irvine it pours a torrent into the sea.
   There are no bleachfields, nor printfields, nor cotton mills
as yet on this river, though it is finely situated for them all;
and, as there is plenty of fire and provisions in this place, and
the manufacturing business going on briskly in this west
country, it is not to be doubted but that there will soon be
some of these public works in this parish.

   Mansion.-The mansion-house of Kilbirny, an old castle,
was built by the Crawfurd family near 300 years ago, and a
new house, with large office-houses adjoined, about 100
years ago, and long inhabited by the Crawfurd family, and
Viscounts of Garnock; and again, about 36 years ago, re-
paired and beautified by the late Earl of Crawfurd; but soon
thereafter was unfortunately burnt; so that now it stands
quite unroofed and ruinous.  It was pleasantly situated, com-
manding a noble prospect, with fine gardens, large parks,
