they continued in a blooming, lively, and thriving state, until
by degrees they overtopped the dikes and fences whereby
they are inclosed.  From that date they withered and de-
cayed gradually in their crops; the baleful infection, which
made an easy prey of the tender crops of the branches,
communicating itself therefrom downwards to the stronger
parts, and from thence to the surface of the ground.  The
whole planting is now decayed to the very root, which still
retains some life and vigour, and the branches shoot out
from it almost flat on the surface of the ground to some
distance, and wear a green and vivid appearance.  From this
circumstance it is evident, that though the soil is not the
most favourable to planting, yet if the influences of the
north could be prevented from the crop, timber of some
kinds would thrive here pretty well; yet I by no means
think, that the fir is anywise calculated for growing in this
country.
   To these causes must also be attributed the difficulty of
making roads in this parish, and indeed in the country in
general.  By Sir John Sinclair's example, and the encou-
ragement given by him, the whole country was animated,
and heartily engaged, in making, repairing, and improving
roads, which proved to be a great advantage; but yet, from
the causes above mentioned, there is reason to apprehend,
that what is already done in this way will soon serve no
other purpose but only a direcion to strangers, if more labour
and expence, with more attention, be not bestowed upon it;
and we may be thankful, if even after that the roads will
be tolerable for more than one half of the year.  However,
the country has great credit from the exertions they have
already made, and still continues to make, in opposition to
these difficulties; and it is to be regretted, that their success
has hitherto been far, very far short of their laudable exer-
tions.  At the same time, it is to be hoped, that by the plan
