although the faith of the people in witchcraft is much en-
feebled.  The people have nothing remarkable in their size,
strength, or features.  They are generally of the middle size,
and of a dusky complexion.  There are some, however, 6
feet in height.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The principal disadvan-
rage this parish labours under, is its great distance from fuel
The nearest coal to Monzie is 20 miles distant.  The com-
mon people burn turf, heath, peats, wood, shrubs, and
broom.  Last winter, coals were sold here at 8 d. a stone; and
even in summer, they are 2 d. the stone.  Another disadvan-
tage is the want of lime; for although it can be got at no
great distance, yet the expence of fuel for burning it, renders
it useless.  Marl is near us, but said not to be very good;
besides it is extremely dear, and the farmers would all give
the preference to lime.  Great advantages, however, are ex-
pected from the improvement and extension of the roads.
In particular, from that excellent one now opened between
Perth and Crieff, and which is intended to be carried for-
ward to Stirling.  There are also some other roads in con-
templation.  Great honour is due to the public spirit and
activity of those Gentlemen, in this and the neighbouring
parishes, for the attempts they are at present making to dis-
cover coal in this part of the country.  We hope, by perse-
verance, these attempts will at last be crowned with success.
