     Statistical Account

Mr. Pennant, on account of the richness and variety of this
prospect, calls it "the GLORY of SCOTLAND."

   River, Fish, and Bridge.-The river Earn, which runs through
the parish, has its source in the loch of that name, and joins
the Tay about 3 English miles below the bridge.  The tide
flows about 2 miles above the bridge; but the water is not
salt.  Sloops, from 30 to 50 tons burden, with lime and coals,
come to the bridge, and, by a little attention, the country
might, by the same navigation, be supplied with wood, iron,
and other articles of foreign commerce.  Salmon, trout, pike,
and some perch, are found in the river; and the proprie-
tors, on each side of it, have salmon fishings, which are of no
great value.  The bridge over the Earn is supposed to be of
great antiquity.  It is kept in repair by the town of Perth,
for which the town has always had a custom or toll; but this
is far from being an adequate fund, considering the great sums
that have been expended in repairs.

   Soil, Cultivation, etc.-The soil of this parish is various.
Clay, till, loam, and some light land, are found.  The pre-
sent fertility of the land is, in a great measure, owing to the ef-
fects of lime, which is a powerful and successful manure,
especially on the clay land.  They lay from 40 to 60 bolls
of shells, or unflacked lime, on the acre.  Summer fallow is a
good deal in use; but the culture of turnips is little attended
to.  The soil in general, being strong, is not easily pulverized, to
make it fit for that crop; besides which, the ploughing is sole-
ly performed by horses.

   Rents.-The rents in general, are from 1 L. 10 s. to 1 L. 13 s.
4 d. per acre.  The valuation of the parish of Dumbarny, in
