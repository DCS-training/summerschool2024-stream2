nued.  Many, however, lately submitted to this salutary
operation, and only a few died.

   Lakes, and Sea-coast.-There are a great many lakes
throughout the ministry, but none so considerable as to me-
rit description.  They are only serviceable as reservoirs
for the rain which descends from the adjoining hills, affording
water for small mills, erected on them for grinding corn.
Some eels and trout are found in them.  These sheets of
water are hurtful to sheep, in time of deep snow and frost, as
they sometimes go upon them when frozen, to reach green
holms, or small islands, in the middle; and, when the thaw
succeeds, they are prevented from reaching their ordinary
pasture.-From the almost insular situation of the ministry,
the sea-coast must be very extensive; but cannot easily be
ascertained.  A good chart of the coast, and bearings, is 
laid down by a Captain Preston.  Not much kelp is made
on these coasts.

   Fish.-Various kinds of fish are caught on the coast,
as ling, cod, mackerel, haddocks, hoes, or dog-fish, skate,
pillocks, and        , and sometimes herrings.  These last
are fluctuating and uncertain: but are excellent in their
kind, and, when well cured, fetch a higher price at market
than those caught on the cost of Scotland.  Ling is the
principal fish caught here.  They are fished on a bank from
30 to 60 miles distant from the shore.  This bank is called
the Haass.  To this ministry belong 42 six-oared boats, and
16 of four oars each.  The large, or six-oared boats, carry
each 6 men; and the small carry 3 or 4 men, who are ei-
ther too young, or too old, for being employed in the lar-
ger fishing.  The haass fishing begins about the first of June,
and till Lammas, when the night becomes too long for
