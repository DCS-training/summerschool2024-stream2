     Statistiscal Account

   Poor.-There are about 58 poor people who receive the
small collections made at the church-door, together with
five guineas, as a donation from Mrs Mackenzie of Seaforth
yearly, and all the money arriving from fines inflicted of de-
linquents.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The fuel used here is peat.
There is no plough in the parish; the little ground that is
tilled, is by the crooked and straight spades.  There are 70
fishing-boats belonging to the parish.  the people from
their youth are accustomed to a sea-faring life; they are of
human dispositions, and shew great hospitality to strangers.
There is no doubt that the condition of the inhabitants of
this poor parish might be greatly meliorated by the intro-
duction of manufactures.  In this particular, Mrs Colonel
Mackenzie of Seaforth has already made some considerable 
advances, by directing the industry of the female inhabitants
to the useful are rational occupation of spinning flax.  Se-
veral marchants at Aberdeen send a great quantity of flax
annually to a trustee at Stornoway, who distributes it to be
spun, not only in this, but in all the parishes of Lewis.  In
this parish there are two spinning schools, the mistresses of
each of them are paid jointly by Mrs Mackenzie of Sea-
forth, and the society for Propagating Christian Knowledge.
The forementioned trustee has a yearly salary paid him by
Mrs Mackenzie and the said society.  To encourage the
young women to acquire the perfect knowledge of spinning
there is an annual competition at each of the schools, and 
premiums given by Mrs Mackenzie to the best performers,
for the purpose of exciting a laudable emulation. The 
premiums are held out to all the taught spinsters in the
island*.
