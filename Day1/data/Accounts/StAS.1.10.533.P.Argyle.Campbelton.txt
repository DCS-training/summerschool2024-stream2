had need of rough lords; and as, in the course of ages, the
influence of no regular government reached these remote
corners, which the Scottish sovreigns had totally abandoned,
the Macdonalds, who made annual circuits to receive and to
spend their revenues, to administer justice, and to enforce a
few simple laws, were, in many respects, useful to their peo-
ple, and of service to society.
   On this account it is not to be wondered, that these little
sovereigns claimed, and were allowed, a very high degree of
consequence.  The representative of the last of these kings, hap-
pening to he in Ireland, was invited to an entertainment given
by the Lord Lieutenant.  He chanted to be among the last
in coming in, and set himself down at the foot of the table,
near the door.  The Lord Lieutenant asked him to sit beside
him; and Macdonald, who had no English, asked "What
"the carl said?" He bids you move towards the head of
the table.  "Tell the carl, that wherever Macdonald sits, that
"is the head of the table."  The opinion conceived of these
lords in their own country, is emphatically expressed in the
short epitaph discovered lately on one of their tombs in Ico-
lumkill, "MAC DONUILL fato hic;"-as much as to say,
that Fate alone could lay Macdonald there.
   The Macdonald, were much celebrated for their hospitality,
and no less for their generosity.  A night`s lodging, or a
simple meal furnished to Macdonald, was often rewarded with
a farm.  That of Coul in Islay was given to one who had pro-
cured him a flounder, when he had probably stood much in
need of it.  Many families in the Highlands hold their pro-
perty in consequence of grants from these lords, who con-
veyed them in charters extremely short, but abundantly
strong.  This will appear from the following specimen,
though divested of the spirit and rhyme of the original: "I
