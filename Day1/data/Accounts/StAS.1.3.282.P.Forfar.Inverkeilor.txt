   Fish.-On this part of the coast there is a small fishing
town, called Etbie-hoven, inhabited by ten industrious fishermen,
who employ two boats.  The fish caught are baddocks, skate,
cod, ling, hody but, and sometimes turbot.  Salted cod, about
nine inches in length), were sent to the London market, and
sold at 5 s per hundred.  In the year 1755, a lobster fishing
commenced, which considerably hurt the fishing of skate,
killing, ling, and holy but, the small fish were not found
to be searver.  In London the demand for salted cod ceased,
but lobster found there a good market.  In the year 1760, 
a salmon fishing was begun on Redcastle and Lunan sands.
It was pretty successful that season, but not since; perhaps,
in some measure, owing to steeping lint in the river Lunan,
which communicates with the bay.  The white fishing con-
tinued much the same, till the year 1786, from which pe-
riod, both the great and the small fish, have been very
scarce, particularly the haddocks.

   Fuel.-The fuel commonly used is coal, brought from
the Frith of Forth, and sold at the harbour of Aberbroth-
ock, at 6s. 6 d a cart load, being 72 stone.  But on all that
pass the Red-head, northward, there is a tax of 18 1\2 d. per
boll.  There are indeed full some whin and broom in the
country, but the supply from these is become, by the im-
provements on agriculture, exceedingly searce.

   Population.-There are no records of this parish, farther
back than the year 1739; since which time the population
has increased.  The number of souls at present in the pa-
rish, is 1747.  In Dr Webster's report, the number is 1286.
The births at an average of seven years amount to45 per
annum, the marriages to 14, the burials to 24.  But it must
be observed, that the number of burials cannot be exactly
