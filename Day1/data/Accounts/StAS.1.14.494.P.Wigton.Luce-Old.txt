900 black cattle, of different ages and descriptions, are
annually sold, including what is bred, and what is bought
in, and kept from 6 to 12 months or more upon the
pasture; about 600 sheep; 150 swine; and 50 packs of

channel to low-water mark, yet the fish of the one river
are easily distinguished by their colour from those of the
