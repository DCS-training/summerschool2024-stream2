ever attempting any measure that might be in their
power for meliorating their farms.  The mosses, at same
time, are so rapidly cut and destroyed, that great dis-
tress for want of fuel must soon ensure; and many of
the people feel this distress already.  It ought to be ob-
served, however, that, under all these unfavourable cir-
cumstances, these parishes, in good years, produce crops
sufficient for the inhabitants, and perhaps never felt a
dearth but in times of general fearcity.  It is obvious,
therefore, that they are capable of improvements.

   Miscellaneous Observations.- Epidemical or chronical
diseases seldom appear in this country.  The people, 
though not robust, are very healthy; and many of both
sexes attain to the age of 80 years and upwards.  There
are, in these parishes, 20 persons now living at and
about that age.  As to the general character of our peo-
ple, they cannot be commended for industry.  The 
small returns for manual labour, may perhaps be the
reason, since none, by the greatest exertions of this kind,
can make rich.  They are however frugal, and have a
sense of honour and shame, in a high degree for their
station; and remarkable for that acuteness of judgement
which has been peculiarly attributed to Highlanders-
In their morals, they are not sufficiency strict in ab-
staining from the smaller breaches of duty; but selony,
or any great crime, has not been committed among them
for many generations.  In their prosession of religion,
they are devout and regular, a little inclined to lay too
much stress upon certain local forms and customs not 
legally imposed, but which, it does not appear, has any
bad effect on their morals.
