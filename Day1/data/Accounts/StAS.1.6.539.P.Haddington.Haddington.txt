During the time of Cromwell's usurpation, an English Com-
pany, of which Colonel Stanfield was the principal person
expended a very considerable sum of money in establishing a
manufactory of fine woollen cloaths.  For this purpose, they 
purchased some lands formerly belonging to the monastery of
Haddington, erected fulling mills, dying houses, etc. and
called the name of the place New mills.  After the restora-

established in 1750 for carrying on the woollen manufactory,
and a large sum was subsribed; but the trade proving un-
successful, the Company dissolved, and a new one formed,
which also in its turn was dissolved a few years ago.

da mother of Malcolm IV. and William the Lion, king of
Scotland, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.  The foundress
and others enriched it with many temporal lands, teinds, and
other benefactions.  The revenues at the time of the Refor-

books of assumption in the Advocates Library, were very con-
siderable.  It was soon after erected into a Lordship, in favour
of John Master of Lauderdale.  It was at this abbey that par-
