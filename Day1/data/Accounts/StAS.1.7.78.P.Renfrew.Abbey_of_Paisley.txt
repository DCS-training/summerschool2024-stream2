but not to the degree that was expected; and probably, to
obtain an unobstructed passage at all times to and from Pais-
ley, some further operations upon the river and canal will still
be necessary.  The tonnage lets at present for 155 l.  But, from
Whitsunday 1792 to that term 1793, it has been let for 250 l.
Paisley has derived considerable advantages from the com-
pleating of the great canal between Forth and Clyde.  The
great and increasing demand for Baltic goods have rendered
that navigation of more consequence to Paisley than it was
perhaps at first supposed it would be.  But, to give this place
the full benefit of it, a branch would be necessary from the
great canal to the Clyde, to terminate as nearly opposite to
the mouth of Paisley river as the ground would permit.
Perhaps it could not be brought nearer than Newshot Isle.
The distance at this place between the canal and the Clyde is
but about one third of a mile; its elevation above the level
of the river nearly 22 feet.  Two locks would therefore be
necessary, and from these the chief expence of the work
would arise.  The advantages, however, would be great.
The navigation would be shortened no less than five miles
for vessels and rafts of wood coming to Paisley.  Two days
would be saved each trip to the proprietors of goods.  The
bulky articles of corn, wood, iron, coal, ashes, soap waste,
etc. etc. which are intended for Paisley, Kilbarchan, John-
stoun, Beith, Houston, Neilstoun, etc. would be brought to
Paisley by water-carriage, instead of being landed at Port-
Dundas, and sent from thence by land-carriage.  The ma-
nufacturers of Paisley might send a great part of their goods
from their warehouses immediately by water carriage to Lon-
don and other places.  A considerable increase of tonnage
would arise to the proprietors of the great canal, and many
important advantages to an extensive and populous tract of
country.
