justice, we are able to assure them, that the bad, and indeed
very indecent state in which they find many of the parish

<FOOTNOTE>

Clergy of Scotland are supported by a small part of the ancient patrimony of
the national church, the remainder thereof being mostly in the possession of
lay titulars or impropriators, whereby, properly speaking, the public can be un-
derstood no more to contribute to the maintenance of the Established Clergy,
than to that of these lay titulars, or impropriators of the patrimony of the church.
Therefore, by our law, when it is judged necessary, from the change on the
value of money, or any other obvious and onerous cause, for the court of teinds,
which was originally a committee of the Parliament of Scotland, to grant
what is called an augmentation, or, more properly speaking, to bring the mi-
nister's present stipend somewhat nearer to its original value, they can have
recourse to these funds only; and no landholders or others are affected either
with stipend, or what is called augmentation of stipend, but only so far as
they are proven to he possessed of them; and though the small remains of the
patrimony of the church, that are full reserved by the Constitution for those
purposes, were, by law, also secularized, and either applied for the lightening
of the taxes, or granted, by royal favour, as the rest have been, to individual,
for services real or supposed, this would not diminish, but, perhaps, rather in-
crease the burden on those on whom it presently lies, who can pretend no
right thereto, more than they can to the old church lands, or free teinds he-
ritably possessed by others, or the free teinds of their own estates, which they,
their ancestors, or authors, have neither obtained by favour from the Crown,
nor as yet purchased, according to law, from their lay titulars, or impro-
priators.  As the secularization of these funds, when understood, in point
of interest, is little to be desired by heritors, so also, if they view the
matter properly, as little by the commonalty, not even by Dissenters
themselves; and, we believe, is really seriously desired by few who have
a sincere regard for the good of their country: because we know of no species
of Christianity it would not be obviously the interest of society to be the Esta-
blished.  Religion, rather than none; for, however in speculative points they
may differ, and, in these, often more in words than ideas, in their regard for
morals, we are satisfied, all the sincere are perfectly united, aud we believe
that most, even of Dissenters, who feel the comfort, and admit the usefulness
of social worship and public instruction, are also friendly to the preservation
