ning with prodigious rapidity and force, and had covered all
the cascades, which are observable when at its ordinary size.
It carried along with it great quantities of grain from the
fields, many trees, and several sheep.  The river, from a little
above the Devil's miln to the Rumbling bridge, is hemmed in
by rocks on each side, not distant, where farthest from each
other, more than 16 feet; and in some places so near, that it
may be stepped over.  The Caldron Linn appeared in its
highest dignity.  As the water filled almost the whole space
between the two falls, up to the summit of the rocks, the
uppermost fall was scarcely discernible; but the other appear-
ed in all its majesty.  The immense body of water, the height
which the fall then had, and the agitation which it produc-
ed in the pool below, formed a most striking and even
an awful scene; and seemed to make the rock quake at the dis-
tance of 30 yards.  When looking up from the side of the
pool below, to the immense body of water rushing over the
fall, it is impossible to describe its dignity, and the amazing
whirling and boiling of the pool.  It was observed about 2
o'clock; the sun shone bright, and there was a fresh gale of
wind.  The gentle vapour which appears at all times, had at
this time increased like a thin cloud; and ascended fully 200
feet above the tops of the rocks.  The rainbow was seen in
full perfection; and the cloud being continually tossed by the
wind, resembled the Aurora Borealis.
   The Dovan, in comparison with other rivers, is exceedingly
small, but at this time, it was a considerable river indeed.  By
an observation made near the present manse of Fossaway, where
it is confined by rocks almost perpendicular, to a channel of 50
feet wide, and running on a declivity of 6 feet in 150, it
was found to exceed its usual size about 12 feet in perpendi-
cular height.
