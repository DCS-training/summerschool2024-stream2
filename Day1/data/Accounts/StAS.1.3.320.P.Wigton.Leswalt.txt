condition.

   Productions, etc.-As this parish has not been measured,
it is impssible to ascertain the number of acres that are in
tillage, though it must be considerable; as, besides assording
a sufficiency for the inhabitants, wheat, meal, and malt
are sold at Stranraer, and there is an annual exportation of
from 6 to 700 bolls of oats and bear, to Ayr, Greenock,
and Port-Glasgow.  Black cattle and sheep are the articles
upon which the farmers cheifly depend for the payment of 
their rents.  There may be about 1500 head of hormes
cattle in this parish, and near 3000 sheep; but these last are
fast decreasing in numbers, as agriculture advances in its
progress.  There are 240 work horses, and above 50 carts
in this parish.-There is no river in it, but there are
two streams of water, called Solburn, and the burn of
Pallanton, both abounding with fine trout, and, a some dis-
tance from the sea, with salmon.  The former empties itself
into the bay of Lochryan, the latter, after many windings
through and extensive plain, into the bay of Luce.  Upon
the sides of these burns, there are large tracks of fine mea-
dow ground, almost to their sources.  None of the hills in
this parish are of any considerable height, though, from the
peninsular situation of the country, they command extensive
prospects.  One in particular, called the Tone of Cragach,
a beautiful green hill, rising in  form of a cone, commands a
full view of the Irish coast, the bay of Belfast, the island of
Arran, and some of the other Western islands.  There are
plain traces of an encampment on the summit of this hill.

   Climate, etc.-The climate here is mild, temperate, and
salubrious, though moist.  There have been several instances
