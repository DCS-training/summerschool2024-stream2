does not appear to be unhealthy, nor is there any distemper
that may be called endemic.  There is one spring strongly
impregnated with iron, and may therefore be useful as a
Tonic; it is about a mile west from the village of Torphi-
chen, and is said to have been much frequented about 40 or
50 years ago.  There is a loch about a mile to the N. E.
of the village of Torphichen, about a mile, or rather more,
in circumference, which affords pike, perch and eel.  There
is a considerable quantity of freestone, and very durable
for building, and plenty of what is commonly called whin-
stone, both made use of for building houses and fences.
Coal is very plenty; a coal-mine has been wrought on the
wester declivity of Cairn Napple for a considerable time,
but is only made use of by the proprietor for burning his
lime, which is in the neighbouring parish of Linlithgow;
about 2 miles farther west, on the farm of Killicanty, a
coal-mine was wrought for a very long period, till within
about 20 years past, and might still be wrought if there
was encouragement.  In this farm, too, there is iron-stone,
2 seams of it having appeared on cutting into a hill for the
purpose of levelling a road; they are about 18 inches a-
funder, and each about 5 inches thick, and of a good qua-
lity.

   Population.-At the time of Dr Webster's report, the
numbers were 1295.  Excepting that the village of Tor-
phichen is considerably increased, it is probable, that the
rest of the parish was more populous even a century ago
than it is at present.  The present amount is 1069.  Deaths,
births and marriages, since 1763 stand thus:
