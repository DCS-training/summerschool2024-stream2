little grass.  Miss Brodie of Lenthen has the right of patron-
age.-There is no fund for the poor, excepting the weekly
collections, which amount to about L. 3 or L. 4 yearly.
The number of poor on the roll is 35, though many more 
might be added.  This sum, joined to the collections made
when the Sacrament is dispensed, furnish but a scanty al-
lowance.  The ordinary method by which the poor in this
country procure a subsistence is by begging.-The salary of
the parish school is L. 10 Sterling, and the number of scho-
lars in winter is about 40.  There is besides a Society
school in a distant part of the parish, for reading and wri-
ting, where the number of children this winter have been 
upwards of 40, and another called a Spinning-school, to
which Miss Brodie of Lethen pays about half the salary,
the rest is paid by the Society, making in all L. 10 Ster-
ling.  Miss Brodie likewise gives the persons who have
charge of this school fuel gratis.
