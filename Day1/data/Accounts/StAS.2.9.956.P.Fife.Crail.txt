joining to Castle Haven several stone-coffins were found with
bones nearly consumed; but, about twenty years ago, about thirty
were discovered lying in regular rows, with bones so entire that the
farmer dug a hole and buried them.  The last were upon the
estate of Wormistone, near the cave in which the Danes are said
to have murdered King Constantine II. in the year 874, and may
have contained the remains of persons killed at that time.
   The only other antiquity in the parish which seems deserving
of notice is the Dane's Dyke, a building of dry stones of about
half a mile in length, said to have been raised by the Danes
when they fled before Constantine II. after defeat at the water of
Leven in 874.  This dike, at one time, enclosed a considerable
piece of ground of a triangular shape, having to the east the little
harbour of Fifeness, whence, it is said, the Danes expected to es-
cape in their boats, which were then hovering at the mouth of the
Frith.  A considerable portion of it is now removed, the farm-
house of Craighead being built upon its site.  From what remains
now faced up on one side as a park fence, some have disputed the
accuracy of the tradition, and maintained that it was a natural,
not an artificial mound.  This supposition, however, is disproved
by the fact, that, in removing a portion of it, human bones were
found, and none but broken and carried stones discovered.  At
the one end, which must have been within the dike, is a natural
cave in the rocks, which the appearance of lime at its mouth in-
dicates to have been extended by artificial means.  This is the
spot of the reputed murder of Constantine.  At the other end,
but without the dike, a place is pointed out called the Long man's
grave, where the ashes of a Danish hero may have been depo-
sited.
             		III.-POPULATION.
   Partly owing to the enlargement of farms and doing away with
cottars, and partly owing to fewer hands being employed in fish-
ery, the population of the town and parish has been diminishing
for a great number of years.
