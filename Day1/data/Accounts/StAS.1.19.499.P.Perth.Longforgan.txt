sist, for the most part, of rich black loam.  Some parts
are covered with a foil of a particular reddish colour, but
very prolific when well dressed; the country people call it
mortar, i. e. a kind of clay 'mixed with gravel, and very dif-
ferent from carfe clay.  The upper part of the parish is of
a very inferior quality.
   About 40 years ago, not half the clay grounds in this
parish were subject to the plough; the ridges were broad,
unequal and crooked, and their crowns only were arable,
between which a broad space, which they called a bauk,
and which conflicted of half of each ridge at least, was left in
natural grafts, upon which the farmers pastured cattle, and
which, in winter, was generally covered with water; even
the surface of there bauks was pared off, and fold for build-
ing and covering houses; and the farmer considered his li-
vots, i. e. the pared surface, as an article of profit.  Clover
and fallow were then unknown; and the clay between For-
gan and the river, which is now the richest part of the pa-
rish, was then so poor, and so unproductive, that tenants
could scarce be got upon any terms; the best of it scarcely
yielding double feed.  Every encouragement therefore was
given; the grounds were drained and fenced at the land-
lords expence, who also gave lime, on leafes for 38 years, to
enable the tenants to improve the land, and indemnify
themselves for labour and expence.  At present, the
ridges in the clay are still in most places unequal and crook-
ed, as it is exceedingly difficult to change their direction,
without very materially injuring the land, and not possible
but at a gret expence; but the whole surface is quite dry,
and the water effectually carried off by means of deep
ditches round and through every farm.  There are no
bauks; but the whole is highly cultivated, well limed, and
kept in good heart by proper management and a regular
