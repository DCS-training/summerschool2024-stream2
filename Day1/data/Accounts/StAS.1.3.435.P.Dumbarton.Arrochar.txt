   Fuel.-The common fuel is peats, which are got in abun-
dance in the hills.  But it sometimes happens, that after all
the expence and trouble of casting and sitting them up, the
season may be so wet as to put it out of the power of the
tenants to get them home.  The better sort of farmers, who
live near Lochlong, make use of coals, which cost about 5 s.
6 d. the Glasgow cart, including freight, etc. It is believed,
upon the whole, every thing being considered, that they are
cheaper than peats.

   Prices of Provisions.-The average price of oat meal may
be estimated at 1 s. per peck.  Sometimes frish meal is im-
ported into Lochlong, and sold under that price; but meal
manufactured in the country is often above it.  The average
price of butter is 9 d. per lib.; of common cheese, 5 s. the
stone tron weight; of a hen 1 s.; and of eggs, 3 d. the do-
zen.  The price of beef is regulated by the Glasgow and
Dumbarton markets.

leading to Tyndrum, is much neglected.  In several places,
particularly at the point of Farkin, and at Craig-an-aren, the
road has been ill planed.  Instead of bringing it up a steep
hill, it should have been brought, at both places, round the
point along the side of the loch, which would not have been
much longer, and might have been executed at nearly as lit-
tle expence as the present line.  It is much wished, that the
roads in these places may be soon altered, and the pulls taken
off, which ara so inconvenient for traverllers, and so oppressive
to horses.  The other roads are kept in repair at the ex-
