and fell for between 4 s. and 5 s. a boll; cows and horses
feed well on them.  Every farmer here sows five or six
lippies of flax-feed; cottagers and those who have small 
possessions, two or three lippies.  Each lippie produces be-

ground in this parish serves for sheep walks; and there may
be of such ground between 70 to 80 acres.

   Church.-The living here is L. 38: 17: 8; one chalder of

   Poor.-The persons receiving charity here, at present, are
one family of five children, another of two, and two single
