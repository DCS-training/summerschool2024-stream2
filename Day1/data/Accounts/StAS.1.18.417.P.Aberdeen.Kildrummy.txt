other towers dissering in magnitude and form, rose for the
protection of the intervening buildings, which appear to have
been but 2 stories in height.  Two of these towers were for
the security alone of the only gate placed in the western wall,
occupying the whole space between them; the walls were 4
feet thick, built of run-lime, and the outside courses of free-
stone, regularly squared; the western wall was reared on the
verge of the acclivity at first described, which rose however
in such a gentle slope, as to afford space for the garden,
which, though warm and finely sheltered, would in the pre-

There may be still traced from the interior of the fortress, a
subterranean vaulted passage, of height sufficient for horses,
opening in the bank, now much above the present bed of the
brook, although it is believed, its channel was then on a

consisting of 3 very long, and very narrow slits.  Tradition
reports, that the chappel was occupied as a magazine of
forage, during the noted siege, by the forces of Edward I.
in the year 1306; that when Robert I. and his wife and
daughter, were understood to have made their escape, by
means of the covered way to the county of Ross, the besieg-

through this window into the forage, occasioned such dis-
traction by the conflagration, that the castle was won by
surprise and storm.
