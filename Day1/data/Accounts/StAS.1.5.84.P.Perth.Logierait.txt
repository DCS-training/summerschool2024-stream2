   Recourse is often had to charms, for the cure of diseases
of horses and cows, no less than in the human species.  In
the case of various diseases, a pilgrimage is performed to a
place called Strathsillan, 40 miles distant from Logierait;
where the patient bathes in a certain pool, and performs
some other rites in a chapel which stands near.  It is
chiefly in the case of madness, however, that the pilgrimage
to Strathsillan is believed to be salutary.  The unfortunate
person is first bathed in the pool, then left for a night bound
in the chapel, and if found loose in the morning, is expected

themselves, of boiled milk and eggs.  These dishes they
eat with a sort of cakes baked for the occasion, and having
small lumps in the form of nipples, raised all over the sur-
face.  The cake might perhaps be an offering to some
deity in the days of Druidism.  On the evening of the 31st
of October, O. S. among many others, one remarkable
enough ceremony is observed.  Heath, broom, and dres-
sings of flax, are tied upon a pole:  This faggot is then
kindled; one takes it upon his shoulders, and running,
bears it round the village; a crowd attend:  When the first
faggot is burnt out, a second is bound to the pole, and
