they are bounded by a steep rock, and on the south they
have outlets which communicate with the river below.
Their form is circular, and they are about a mile and a half
in circumference.  These lakes abound with trouts of various
sizes.

   Hills.-The hills in there parishes are of a very consider-
able height, particularly those in Clova, which form part of
the Grampians.  They are partly conical, and partly almost
perpendicular.  The most romantic are those situated on the
south-east end of the parish of Clova, and which, on the
north and south side, encompass a beautiful valley about 4
miles in length, and half a mile in breadth.  Here the stu-
penduous height of the mountain, contrasted with the de-
lightful narrow plain below, exhibits a scene of grandeur and
beauty united.

   Quadruped and Birds.-The number of horses is about 400,
and of black cattle 1200.  The horses and cattle are generally
of a small size.  A horse of 5 years old brings, in the market,
from 7 L. to 10 L. Sterling; a cow or ox, of 4 years old, from
4 L. to 6 L.  The number of sheep may be about 8000 in
summer, but fewer in winter.  They are mostly of the black
faced kind, bought, when a year old, in the Linton markets,
in the months of June and July, and kept for four years.
They arc sold fat about Martinmas, to butchers, at the neigh-
bouring markets.  They bring from 12 s. to 16 s. a head.
There are also white-faced sheep, but of a smaller size than
the former.  The number of swine in the parish is very
small.  The wild quadrupeds are deers, hares, and foxes.
Of the winged tribe there are, besides tame fowl, muir fowl,
wild ducks, partridges, and tarmacks.
