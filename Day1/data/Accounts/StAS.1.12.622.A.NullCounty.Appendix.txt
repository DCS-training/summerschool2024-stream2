   IT is curious to observe the opposition between the opinion of the Highlanders,
founded upon experience, and the reasoning of philosophers derived from spe-
culation, with respect to the varying degrees of the heat and cold of the sea-
sons in ancient and modern times.  Those who assert that the seasons have be-
come more mild and genial, maintain this opinion upon the authority of the
classick writers, without considering, that in estimating the cold and heat of
other countries, a Greek or Roman, would naturally make their own warm
latitudes the standard of their feelings.  In forming a system, few facts serve as
a foundation for rearing a specious superstructure.  That the quantity of water
upon the face of the globe is decreasing, has been attempted to be proved from
the induction of experiment.  The philosophers of Sweden, by measuring the
waters upon the shores of the Baltick, have found that they sink in the pro-
portion of half an inch annually.  But are there no instances in other countries,
where they rise in a similar proportion.  During the ninth century, the Danes
in their predatory excursions, built a fort upon the Moray Frith, which is now
covered by water, but still visible in its ruins when the sea is tranquil on a se-
rene summer day.  It must, however, be acknowledged, that the above opi-
nion of the gradual decrease of the waters, is not a novelty in speculation.  It
was embraced, in part, by the ancient feet of the Druids, who held the de-
struction and renovation of the world by fire and water alternately.  The Stoicks
also taught the same doctrine, as may be seen, by consulting the second book of
Cicero's beautiful Treatise, "De Natura Deorum."
