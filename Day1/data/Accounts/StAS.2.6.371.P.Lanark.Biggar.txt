	Of the 733 members of these societies, only 323 belong to this parish.

	Inns and Alehouses.--There are five inns in the parish, and ten
grocers who are licensed to sell spirits. The effect of such a
number of public houses is in every respect pernicious.*
	Banks.--A branch of the Commercial Bank was established
here in 1833, and is understood to be flourishing. A handsome
building is at present in course of erection for its accommodation.
A savings bank was instituted in July 1832. The depositors con-
sist chiefly of farm-servants. Their number at this date (August
1835) is 200, and the amount of deposits L. 1168.
	Fairs.--There are three fairs held in Biggar, the Candlemas
fair, the Midsummer fair, and the old Biggar fair, held on the last
Thursday of October, old style. The first is a hiring market,
and very well attended. At the second, a little business is done in
wool. The third is for horses and black cattle.

<FOOTNOTE>It would be quite enough for the public convenience here, and in most places of
the same size, if the license were granted only to persons who keep stables and other
accommodations for travellers. At any rate, the grocers should be restricted from
allowing the spirits they sell to be consumed on their premises. As it is at present,
their shops are often infested with loiterers in all stages of drunkenness,--an exhibition
of the worst influence on young persons, and others who may have occasion to go
there. Another bad practice is the licensing of toll-keepers. Often shifting about,
they are less interested in maintaining a good character than the more stationary in-
habitants; and in order to make the most of their short leases, and eke out a High
rent, perhaps they are often tempted to encourage excess. In many places, however,
ten per cent. of additional rent is given for a toll-bar that is licensed, and while this is
the case, it will be very difficult to get the practice abolished. Candidates for ale and
spirit licenses are generally required to produce a certificate of character from the mi-
nister of the parish in which they reside, but in one instance in this district, where the
ministerial certificate was withheld from a toll-keeper on account of bad character, no
explanation of the circumstances was ever required from the minister, and yet the toll-
keeper-found no difficulty in getting his license.
