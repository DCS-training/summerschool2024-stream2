   Dalswinton.-The estate of Dalswinton is by far the largest
in the parish.  It was there where the Cumings in former
times had one of their chief seats.  It was a large Gothic build-
ing, reared on one of the highest eminences in the neighbour-
hood.  In 1750, and for some time after, large portions of
the old walls were standing; and, from these ruins it appear-

There stones were afterwards used for building a mansion-
house and offices, immediately below the eminence.  The
mount where the castle stood, and the grounds adjacent were

estate was purchased by Patrick Miller, Esq. who has already

improved great part of the estate, and has made Dalswinton
one of the finest feats in the south of Scotland.  He is in a like-
ly way of preventing the river Nith from making such depredations
upon the rich holm lands, as it had formerly done; and is ef-
fecting many other alterations and improvements of equal im-
portance.  He has now built, on the mount where the old cas-
tle stood (and as near to the old foundation as was consistent
with the safety of the building) one of the best and most com-
modious dwelling houses, for its dimensions, of any in this
part of the kingdom.  From its top, there is one of the
most extensive and pleasing prospects any where to be met
with.

1200.  In 1755, according to Dr Webster, the number was
