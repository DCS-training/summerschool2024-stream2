upon a stone, above the entry to the choir of the church, it
appears to have been dedicated during that prelate's incum-
bency, in the year 1197.
   This cathedral is one of those few stately fabrics of Gothic
architecture, which escaped destruction at the time of the Re-
formation, (when the indiscreet zeal, of the first reformers, le-
velled to the ground, almost every place of religious worship
in the kingdom), being saved by the public spirit of the citi-
zens.  It appears, however, from the records of the Town-
council, 19th January 1573, that, notwithstanding the care
of the citizens to prevent the cathedral from utter destruc-
tion, a great part of the lead, slates, and other materials of
the church, had been, through the disorders of the times,
dilapidated:  And that, although the city was not under a-
ny legal obligation, to uphold the fabric in repair, (that be-
ing incumbent on those then in possession of the See), yet they
voluntarily taxed themselves in L. 200 Scotch, to repair
the cathedral, though under express protestations, that such
contributions should infer no precedent.  Archbishop Spot-
tiswood relates, that, in the year 1578, it had nearly been
demolished, but was saved by the public spirit of the crafts,
who took arms to prevent its destruction.
   This cathedral was dedicated to St Mungo or Kentigern.
It had 39 prebends attached to it, the prebendaries of which
had houses and gardens in its neighbourhood, being obliged
to reside there, and to employ curates or vicars in their
respective parishes.  After the Reformation, these houses
were either sold or given to the nobleman or gentlemen, who
were at that time favourites at court.  One of them, which
belonged to the prebendary of Douglas, was given to the Earl
of Eglinton, and, after passing through several hands, was
purchased by the city of Glasgow in 1635, who have since
used it as the correction house.  Another, which belonged
to the parson of Glasgow, was given to Lord Kilmarnock,
