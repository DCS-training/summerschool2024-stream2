     Of St. Vigeans.

A considerable quantity fo flax is also raised here, generally
the 2 d crop after breaking up ley ground, 9 or 10 pecks of
Riga or Dutch lint-seed are sown on the acre, which produce
from 25 to 30 stones avoirdupoise weight of dressed flax; rent
of the acre about 5 L.  About 200 stones of hay are raised on
the acre.  For threshing corns, the farmers allow their barn-
men the 21st boll, without any victuals or the 25th, with 1
meal a-day.  There are now in the parish 4 or 5 threshing
machines; but it will require some time and experience, be-
fore it is known whether or not they will prove advantageous
to the farmers; they seem to think that the working of them
is hurtful to their horses.  It is supposed that the parish does
not now produce meal sufficient for the consumption of the
inhabitants; but there are about 1500 bolls of wheat, and
between 2000 and 3000 bolls of barley sold yearly, the great-
er part of which is sent to Leith and Glasgow.  Turnips are
raised on almost every farm; and some black cattle are fed
and sold to the butchers of Arbroath, form 10 L. to 14 L. the
head*.

   Poor, etc.-There are generally between 20 and 30 poor
persons, who receive alms from the public fund of the parish,
which consists of an annuity paid out of an estate in the parish
