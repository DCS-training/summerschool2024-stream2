and Redgorton; on the north and east by the parish of St.
Martin; and on the south and east by the parish of
Kinnoul.
   Its form is irregular; but, on the whole, it approaches in
a certain degree to a square.  Its extent from north to south,
as well as from east to west, is about 3 English miles; and
consequently it consists of about 9 square miles, containing
about 4600 Scots acres.  Of these, about 3000 are under
grass and corn; 700 planted; 500 common, (now under sub-
mission in order to a division), and the rest is either occupied
by roads and villages, or is hitherto in an uncultivated
state.

   Appearance.-From the side of the Tay, on the west, the
surface of the earth continues, on the whole, to rise to the
east border, where it is considerably above the bed of the
river.  Though there is a considerable part of it in level
ground; yet every where, here and there, it forms itself
into small hills, of a gradual and easy ascent.  But there are
no rocks or precipices, except in the quarries, and scarcely
any steep places, except by the sides of brooks.  Every spot
almost is arable; and there is scarcely a hill, which is not al-
ready either planted or ploughed.  The whole of the west
part of the parish has a cultivated and beautiful appearance.
Towards the middle, and the east border, there is a conside-
rable quantity of ground planted; and some spots which are
still in a state of nature.  The proportion of what is unculti-
vated is comparatively small; and every year serves to di-
minish it.  The whole surface, will, most probably, in a
few years, be either corn fields, or plantations.  Those few
spots on the west side, which have hitherto been neglected,
are covered chiesly with furze and broom; and those of the
same description, on the east, chiefly with dwarf heath.
