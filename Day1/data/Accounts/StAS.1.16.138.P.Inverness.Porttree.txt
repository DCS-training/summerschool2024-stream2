     PARISH OF PORTREE,

     ANCIENTLY KILTARAGLAW,

     (COUNTY OF INVERNESS, SYNOD OF GLENELG, AND
     PRESBYTERY OF SKY.)

     By Mr ALEXANDER CAMPBELL, Schoolmaster, Portree.

     Name, Situation, Extent, etc.

   PORTREE was a part of Snizort till the year 1726,
when it was erected into a separate parish; and is so
called from its excellent harbour of the same name.  Port-
ree, or rather Port a Rio, (the King's Harbour), is a Gaelic
word, compounded of Port, an Harbour, and Rio, a King.
This name was probably given to it as far back as the
thirteenth century, in the reign of Alexander III. of Scot-
land, when Haco, King of Norway, after his dreadful over-
throw at the Largs by Alexander Stuart, great-grandfather
of him, who, the first of that name, reigned in Scotland,
put in there with the remains of his shipwrecked fleet; or,
as some would have it, not till the times of James V. in
