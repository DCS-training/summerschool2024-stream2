have not now those warm summers, which they remembers
fifty years ago.
   With respect to insanity, that most deplorable evil, there
were received at the Infirmary here, in the course of the
24th year from its institution, ending April 1788, 13 lu-
natics.  In the 12th and 13th years, ending April 1791, 20.
These proportions are far greater than they were previous
to 1788; but this must in a considerable degree be ascribed;
to the increased resort of patients to the Infirmary, in con-
sequence of what had been experienced, of the beneficial ef-
fects, of regular treatment and safe custody.  The excessive
and increasing use of spiritous liquors, amongst the lower
ranks of people, is justly to be considered as a great cause of
this, as well as of other diseases, to which they are liable.
   The practice of inoculation for the small pox became
frequent here, as soon, or sooner than in many other parts
of Scotland.  It began as early as the year 1733, about se-
ven years after its introduction into Britain; and has, in ge-
neral, been attended with its ordinary good effects.  Agues
were very prevalent here 40 years ago, but now occur but
rarely amongst us.  Since the year 1623, it is not remem-
bered that Dumfries has suffered, in any extraordinary degree,
from any epidemical distemper.  The small-pox was indeed
very fatal in 1734; and the death of at least 100 persons by that
disease, in a few months, might contribute towards the encou-
ragement of inoculation, then beginning to be introduced.
   Many persons in Dumfries and the neighbourhood have
attained to the age of 70 and 80 years; and two or three
are now living who have passed their 90th.
