in the center, and his relatives or dependents at certain di-
stances around him.  But we shall be at a loss to account for
the smallness of these graves, unless we suppose them to have
contained only ashes or bowels of the deceased person.
These, it is likely, were deposited in earthen pitchers or vases,
as several vessels of that-kind have been dug up by the plough
in the neighbourhood of these cairns.  There is also in the
north side of the river Skiack, and nearly opposite to the
village of Drummond, a grave of an oblong form, lined with
stone in the same manner as those above described; it is call-
ed the Priest's Sepulchre, and is 7 feet long, 3 broad, and
about 3 1/2 deep.  It is evident from these remains, and many
others of a similar nature, which abound in almost every part
of the Highlands of Scotland, that it was the custom of our
ancestos to cover their burying places with heaps of stones;
and the reason probably was, to prevent the bodies from be-
ing dug up, and devoured by the wolves, wild boars, and
other beasts of prey, which then insested the country*.
There are ruins of five different chapels and burying places
in this parish, viz. one at Balcony, called St Ninian' Chapel,
one at Culnaskeath, one at Wester Fowlis, one at Kilchoan,
and one at Limlair, near the sea shore, called St Mary's Cha-
pel.  Several families continue still to bury at the last named
church-yard, and there are some vestiges of the manse, or
minister's house, contiguous-to it.  The last incumbent's
name was Mr Henry Kincaid, who seems to have lived about
the beginning of the last century; for it appears from some
records that he disposed of certain teinds to the Baron of
Fowlis in 1607.
