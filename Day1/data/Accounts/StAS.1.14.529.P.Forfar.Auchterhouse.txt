ness.  This evil will remain, till the proprietors of land
resolved to build, at their own expense, all the houses ne-
cessary for the good accommodation of the people upon
their estates.  And considering that, by doing so, they
gain 2 1/2 per cent., they beautify the country, and augment
the happiness of those persons by whose industry and la-
bour they enjoy case, affluence, and splendour, it is not a
little surprising, that the gentlemen have been so long in-
attentive to their own interest, and the comfort of their
fellow creatures.
   From the tenants of the one estate in this parish, no incon-
siderable number of services and carriages are exacted;
which, while they profit not the landlord, bear hard upon
the tenant, and are hostile to all im[provement in agricul-
ture.  There is, however, reason to belive, that a total
abolition of this species of slavery (the only thing meriting
that obdious name remaining in the country), will soon be
accomplished:  Already, much of it has been done away
within these few years past.  It is true, those lands sub-
jected to the greatest weight of services, are comparative-
ly low rented.  The condition of cotagers is not the
most comfortable.  Happy would it be for this order of
men, were they to hold the landlord, and not of the
tenant.  Few tenants prove gentle masters.
