   Woods and Fuel.-The natural wood is considerable; it
will bring, at a cutting, betwixt 2000 L. and 3000 L. Sterling.
Besides this, there are nearly 200 acres planted with Scotch
firs, larixes, etc.  These plantations are all succeeding well, and
being laid out with judgment and taste, give an appearance
of improvement to the country, which cannot fail to please.
Coal is the principal fuel, 12 cwt. of which, brought by wa-

cannot fail to accelerate the improvement of the country, and
increase the real rent of the proprietors.  In the neighbour-
hood of the Leven, many inclosures are let upon leases, for
between 2 L. and 4 L. Sterling per acre.  There are 13 heri-

   Roads.-The two great roads through the parish, the one
leading to Loch-Lomond, the other running along the Clyde,
are kept in the best possible repair.  To these the statute
labour, now commuted, is annually applied.  Great praise,
however, cannot be bestowed on the cross or parish roads.
But as the commissioners must be sensible of the necessity of
