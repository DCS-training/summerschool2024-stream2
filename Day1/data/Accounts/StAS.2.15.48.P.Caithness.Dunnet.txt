iron ploughs and two horses being in general use. The pernicious
system of servitude is abolished. Wages of labour of all kinds are
more than doubled. The population was then (1791) 1399, it is
now 1906,-certainly enjoying more comfort than at that period,
and doing, a vast deal more business. The houses also, with a
few exceptions, have been much improved: in many cases, com-
fortable cottages have been erected.
  The improvement which the parish is susceptible of, has already
been pointed out. There is certainly a want of employment for fe-
males within doors; perhaps the growth of flax and the working of it
as in Flanders, might be of use to remedy this evil. There are also
a number of small tenants at a distance from the sea, who would be
better employed as labourers, and the land they possess would be
more productive under a different system. Seeing the climate for-
bids the cultivation of the more valuable grains, wheat, barley,
beans, and pease, (of all which the soil produces great crops, but
they only ripen well in favourable seasons, and are not for a man
to meddle with who has a rent to pay,)-the attention of the far-
mer should be turned to grass, turnips, bear, and oats, which are
produced, where well cultivated, in abundance. He should be ac-
tive in rearing and feeding cattle and sheep for the southern mar-
kes, which, now from the introduction of steam navigation, can
be sent as cheap in a few hours by sea, as they could be driven by
land in a month, some years ago. Thus, by increasing the ex-
ports of the parish, and getting money in return, its cultivation
may be still farther extended and improved, and the quantity of
labour increased, which is the only sure means of adding to the
happiness and comfort of the labouring classes in a rural commu-
nity.
