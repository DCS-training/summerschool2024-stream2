succeeded by Mr. David Blair, who had been minister at
Lochlee, was translated to the second, and after that to
the first charge in Brechin.  He was succeeded by the pre-
sent incumbent Mr. John Bisset, who had been minister at
Culsalmond, and was admitted minister of the first charge in
Brechin on the 9th of November 1769.
   His stipend consisted at first of 85 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 lippies
