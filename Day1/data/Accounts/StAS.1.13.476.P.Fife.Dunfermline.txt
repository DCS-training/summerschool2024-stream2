     of Dunfermline.

     M.M. 1st, An upcast dike to the north.
     a. b. c. D (between two dikes).  The three seams of
     coal, and two of iron-stone, represented on the  
     south of said dike, which are cast up by it into
     the north, all above, and drained by the lowest
     level.
     Q. Q. A coal pit, by which the said three seams are
     wrought and raised level free.
     e. e. A kind of dike, or rather stage, which is sometimes 
     met with in the level course of the coal, nearly
     perpendicular, without casting the coal up or down
     on the either side of it.
     M. M. 2d, Another large dike, which throws up the 
     seams of coal considerably to the north, and
     in some parts they dip more rapidly after-

     G. G. An engine pit on the south side of the first dike,
     to drain the coast from x. to x. that is below the
     level.

     to drain the coal from N. to N. in all the seams

     north side of the north dike.

   1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.  Nine seams of coal on the
north side of the second dike, from two to five feet thick
each, making in all, upwards of 30 feet of coal under the
surface, in some parts of this parish.  The three lowest of
those nine seams are supposed to be the three seams a. b. c.
on the south.  The other six appear to be upper seams
that come on from the north.  Those nine seams are mark-
ed where they are intersected by the north engine pit, and
are continued downward, to show, that is there were no
