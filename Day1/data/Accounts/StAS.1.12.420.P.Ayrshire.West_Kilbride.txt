of 50 feet, into a deep and awful chasm, the bottom of which,
is formed into a capacious shpere, as if it has been hollowed
out with a chisel, and resembling a bason tumbled upon its

point, the landscape is abundantly charming and diversified.
A few paces in front, are the remains of a small chapel; the

his professions, reflects honour upon the spot that gave him
birth, was a native of this place.  He long enjoyed a pretty
considerable estate in it, which he inherited from his ancestors,
but which is now, by purchase, gone out of the family, into
the hands of another proprietor.  In this obscure retreat, he
