     Statistical Account

from Kearn, is covered with heath, moss and turf.  It makes
an excellent sheep-walk in summer.  As they stroll in it night
and day, they afford excellent mutton in the months of Sep-
tember and October, in dry seasons.  Its perpendicular height
from the bed of the river Don, will be between 400 and 500
yards.  Immediately on the opposite side of the river, there is
another mountain, nearly of the same height, called Calwar;
at the foot of which there is one farm belonging to the parish
of Forbes: That part of the hill which belongs to this farm, is
covered with heath, and makes a good sheep-walk.

   Fuel.-Peats and turf are the only fuel made use of in this
district, which the hill of Correen affords in great plenty, and
of the best quality.  The tenant, however, cannot accommo-
date his family with so necessary an article, but at a very
high expence yearly.  For besides the expence of casting up
peats and turf, the whole summer quarter is spent in drying
and bringing them home; and if to this be added the loss of
the summer season, for preparing dung for the land, it will be
impossible to calculate the damages, either to the tenant as an
individual, or to the public at large.  Heath is generally made
use of for drying corn for the mill, as well as for house use.
No coal is used in this district but for smithy work.

   Manure.-Animal dung (mixed with earth and peat ashes),
is the only manure used in the district.  Although there be
lime-stone quarry in the hill of Correen, of a very fine qua-
lity, and plenty of peats and turf to burn it, no persevering
attempt has yet been made to bring it to a proper bearing.
The heritors are careless and remiss, and the tenants have nei-
ther abilities nor encouragement to work it.
