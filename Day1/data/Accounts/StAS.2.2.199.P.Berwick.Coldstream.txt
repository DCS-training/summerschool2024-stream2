	PARISH OF COLDSTREAM.
PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE.
   THE REV. THOMAS SMITH GOLDIE, MINISTER.

	I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name, Boundaries-THE original name of the parish of Cold-
stream was Lennal. It is found in ancient charters written in the
various forms of Leinhall, Lenhal, Leinal, Lennal, and Lennel.
The kirk-town of Lennel stood on the north bank of the Tweed,
which at that place forms a pool, or Llyn, as it is termed in the
Cambro-British dialect. When the Saxon settlers took posses-
sien of the vale of the Tweed, they added to the original name
their own term Hal, which signifies a large house, and thus was
formed the name Leinhall, which is to be met with in deeds as early
as 1147. The church of Leinhall continued in the possession of
the Prioress of Coldstream, till the period of the Reformation, and
retained its original name for a century and a-half after that epoch.
The original village was destroyed by the English in their preda-
tory incursions; and in 1716 a new parish church was built at Cold-
stream, which was then becoming the most populous district of
the parish.
   The parish extends 71/2 miles in length, and somewhat more
than 4 in breadth; it is of an irregular rectangular shape, and has
the parish of Ladykirk for its boundary on the east; Simprin, now
united to Swinton, on the north; Eccles on the west; while Tweed
it from England on the south.
   Topographical Appearances.-The general appearance of the
parish is flat, and there is no rising ground that deserves the name
of hill. Five-burn-mill toll-bar is 108 feet above Berwick pier,
Coldstream bridge is 61 feet, and Hatchednize 188 feet above the
same level. Dovecotamins is considerably higher than any of these
places.
   Meteorology-The quantity of rain that falls in this parish is
comparatively inconsiderable. The situation of the parish, in re-
ference to the direction and distance of the neighbouring hills, may
