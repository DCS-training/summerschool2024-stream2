     Statistical Account

by the water of the Forth.  But be this as it may, the histo-
ry of the battle of Bannockburn, gives sufficient evidence
that the carses, in the Reign of King Robert Bruce, formed
an almost impassible morass.
   It is by no means probable, that the exertions of art were
much employed in improving the original appearance of the
parish.  We have few monuments of antiquity, except the
Roman causeway which enters the parish at the Torwood,
and passes through it in a north-westerly direction.
   The ruins found in the Muirland, near the source of the
Carron, should, with some others in the parish, have been
passed over in silence, were they not generally supposed to be
the remains of a castle, the residence of Sir John the Graham,
who fell in the battle of Falkirk, defending the liberty of his
country, against the ambition of Edward.

   Present Appearance.-The present appearance of the parish
is very different from its former state; the face of the country
is naturally beautiful, and the natural beauty of the hills and
vallies is increased by the windings of the Forth, by innu-
merable inclosures, by many young thriving plantations, by
a variety of villages, and by several genteel houses, appearing
in different parts of the parish.
   The carses are now esteemed as valuable as any land in
North-Britain.  They have already attained the highest de-
gree of modern cultivation; and generally produce luxuriant
crops of wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, flax, and artificial
grasses.
   The dryfields are in general arable, and have likewise reach-
ed a considerable degree of cultivation.  They produce the
same crops with the carses; though the produce of the latter
be generally superior to the produce of the former, both in
quantity and quality.
