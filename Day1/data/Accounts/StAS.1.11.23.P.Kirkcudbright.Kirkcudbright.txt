     of Kirkcudbright.

He has no manse, notwithstanding there were, in former times,
3 churches, 3 manses, and 3 glebes.  Instead of a manse he
has 15 L. per annum.  This he had to contend for before the
Court of Session.  The sum is too small for the rent of a
house in Kirkcudbright.

   Character and Manners.-The people of Kirkcudbright are,
in general, of a pleasant, social and agreeable disposition, and
their morals are fully as good as those of their neighbours.
Few or none are ever incarcerated for crimes or misdemeanors.
Formerly they were said to have been much addicted to drinking,
and perhaps there was some truth in the report; now, except
amongst a very few of the lowest classes, the charge would be
unjust.  In point of taste, they are much superior to most
people of the parishes around them.  Their reading is exten-
sive; and being furnished with an excellent subscription lib-
rary of the best modern books, they have access to all the
improvements in literature and politics.  They are all loyal
to government; and no less attached to the principles of the
British Constitution, than averse to divisions in the Church.
No minister in the church of Scotland can boast of such una-
nimity amongst his people: For among the whole 2,295 that
compose the parish, there is not one dissenter, or seceder, of
any denomination whatever.
