and patronised by the late Earl of Errol, about 30 years
ago.  The very attempt would be meritorious; and
should it be attended with the probable and desired ef-
fect, besides the pleasure it would give to every bene-
volent heart, to raise a numerous and most important
class of men from a state of inactivity and penury to in-
dustry and affluence, the money laid out would soon re-
turn to themselves or their heirs with tenfold interest;
and a few years experience of the mode and profit of an
improved system of husbandry would, in a short time,
render the continuance of premiums quite unnecessary.-
Having fairly made the experiment himself for 6 months
past, the writer earnestly recommends to farmers who
plough with 6 or 8 oxen and a driver, to plough with
2 large oxen in harness, without a driver; besides saving
the meat and wages of a driver, they will plough more,
and better than 6 or 8 of their present size of oxen; they
will not require so much provender; and, if yoked in a
cart like horses, each of them will draw a load that 4
of their small garrons would not move.  The writer
cannot conclude this miscellaneous branch of his subject,
without observing, that it must give the greatest plea-
sure to every friend to his country, to look forward to
the many and important advantages that agriculture and
manufactures will derive from a Board of Agriculture
and internal improvement, sanctioned by Parliament, on
the patriotic and well-digested plan proposed by Sir John
Sinclair.
