     Statistical Account

self, the minister applied to the Presbytery for a visitation,
and by the oaths of sufficient workmen of each craft, got
it declared ruinous, and it still continues so, which obliged
the minister to leave the place, after he had served 36 years
and upwards.  It is also observable, and very singular,
that it pays neither stipend, nor has any glebe.

   Population.-The population of the parish is much the
same as it was 50 years ago.  Its inhabitants may now a-
mount to about 160; the number of burials do not exceed
3 or 4 each year; the births about 8 or 10 yearly.  There
is no village in the island.

   Fuel.-The principal disadvantage under which this pa-
rish labours, is the scarcity of fuel.  The common people
burn turf or peat, which they are obliged to carry from
Hoy and other places.

   Schools.-There are no schools in either of the parishes
of Hoy or Gr‘msay, owing to the proprietors, who cannot
be prevailed upon to settle a parochial school, and for that
reason, the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge
have for some years past withdrawn their charity schools;
and notwithstanding the minister of the place applied to
the commissioners of the county to interpose their autho-
rity, which he did by petition, and under form of instru-
ment above 30 years ago, yet to this day he never got any
deliverance upon it; and now the minister, being reduced
by old age and infirmities, is not in condition to go
about such matters.

   Rent.-The land-rent of the island is computed at L. 100
Sterling a-year, besides casualties equal to one half more.
