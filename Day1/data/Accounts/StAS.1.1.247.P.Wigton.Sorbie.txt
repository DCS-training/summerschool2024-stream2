principal bays are those of Garliestown; Rigg, now called
Hunter's Bay, in compliment to Captain Hunter of the na-
vy, who came to an anchor in it, with Lord Garlies on board;
and Ports Allan, Whaple, and Innerwell.  Many other small-
er bays indent the coast in a most beautiful manner, where
vessels, loaded with lime and sea-shells, deliver their cargoes.

   Garliestown is well situated for a harbour not only to
serve its own neighbourhood, but all the trade of the west
of England, from Liverpool to Carhsle; that of the west of 
Scotland to Wales and England; and that of Ireland and
Man.  But no trade would profit so much  by it as large
and important one from Whitehaven to Dublin.  This great
trade, to which one tide of vast consequence, is consi-
derably retarded by the south, south-west, and west winds,
which are more frequent there than any other.  Were there
a good harbour at Garliestown, the ships bound from White-
haven to Dublin might come over to it with south and south-
west winds, and deliver their cargoes much sooner than they
do at present.  To this desirable end the tides are particu-
larly favourable.

   Cattle, Wool, etc.-The black cattle of this parish and
neighbourhood are of the best quality.  Lord Galloway thinks
he has improved the size and shape of the original breed, by
introducing Westmorland bulls.  His Lordship gave new
life to a spirit of emulation among the breeders, by a pre-
mium of a very handsome silver cup, which he bestowed eve-
ry year on the person who produced the best four year old
ox or cow.  With respect to Galloway cattle in gene-
ral, those in the muirs differ only from those in the improved
part of the country in their size. The last description of cat-
