   Schools.-There are in this parish two established schools.
The parish school was erected in the year 1661, according
to the form therein required, under the patronage of John,
Archbishop of Glasgow; the legal salary was fixed at 100
pounds Scots:  It is remarkable, that in the deed of erection,
there is an express clause, declaring, that the schoolmaster, in
all time coming, should teach Latin; and that the school should
be constantly held at the Clachan of Campsie.  There was
another school erected in 1727, on a mortification of fifty

that at, an average, there are somewhat above 200 children
educated annually in the parish:  There are at least one
fifth part at school of those who are below twelve years of
age.  The inhabitants of this parish are, upon the whole,
