<FOOTNOTE>

great many families left the parish.  These are now (1794) returning,
and many more may be expected; both on account of the distilleries,
which are again reviving, and the Devon iron work.  So that in a few
years, it is higly probable, that the population of this parish will be
much greater than it is at present.
