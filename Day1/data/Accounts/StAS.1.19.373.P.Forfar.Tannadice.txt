   The greatest part of the ground is hilly or mountainous.
The soil, in the lower parts of the parish, is in general good.
It is more inclined to clay than sand, except on the brink
of the river Esk.  The air is dry, pretty sharp in winter,
but in general wholesome.  In former times the ague
prevailed much, especially in one district, called the Glen
of Ogil.  But now the case is otherwise.  The most com-
mon distemper is the low nervous fever, which may indeed
be considered as the characteristic distemper of this county.
Twenty or thirty years ago, what is commonly called the
louping ague greatly prevailed.  This disease, in its symp-

Those affected with it, when in a paroxysm, often leap or
spring in a very surprising manner, whence the disease has
derived its vulgar name.  They frequently leap from the
floor to what, in cottages, are called the baulks, or those
beams by which the rasters are joined together.  Some-
times they spring from one to another with the agility of a
cat, or whirl round one of them with a motion resembling
the fly of a jack.  At other times they run, with astonish-
ing velocity, to some particular place out of doors, which
they have fixed on in their minds before, and perhaps men-
tioned to those in company with them, and then drop down
quite exhausted.  It is said, that the clattering of tongs, or
any noise of a similar kind, will bring on the sit.  This
melancholy disorder still makes its appearance; but it is
far from being so common as formerly.  Some consider it
as entirely a nervous affection; others as the effect of worms.
In various instances, the latter opinion has been confirmed
by facts.
   There are several mineral springs within the bounds of
this parish, but none of any consequence.  It contains no
lake.  But the want is amply supplied by the beautiful
South Esk, which in some places forms the boundary of the
