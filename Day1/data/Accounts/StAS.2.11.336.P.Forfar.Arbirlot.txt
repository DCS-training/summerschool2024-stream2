it is kept in the manse, contains between 400 and 500 volumes,
and is supported by nearly 100 subscribers who pay 1s. 6d. or 2s.
yearly.
        Savings Bank.-About two years ago, a Savings bank was esta-
blished. Four respectable farmers are directors, along with the
minister, who is the manager. Last year the deposits amounted to
above L. 230, and they have increased fully L. 100 in the course
of the last twelvemonths.
        Inns.-About two years ago, there were 2 inns in the parish,
but now there is only 1.
        Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
receiving parochial aid is 16, and the average sum allotted to each
is between 4s. and 5s. The annual amount of contributions for
their relief, taking the average of the last five years, is L. 55 from
church collections, and L. 24 from other sources, such ar seat rents
of the aisle, interest of capital, payments for mortcloth, &c.
There is no other mode of procuring funds for the poor than those
mentioned, and no other is needed; for L. 15 or L. 20 have been
saved yearly for some few years back. The poor's fund is the last
shift with the poor; and nothing but bard necessity makes them
go upon it.
        Fairs.-There is a fair held in the parish, but it is a very trifling
one.

		MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	At the time of the former Statistical Account (1791, when the
population was fully larger than at present,) the yearly amount
of funds for the poor was about L. 35; and now it is about
L. 8O. At the time of the former Statistical Account, there was only
1 school in the parish, and now there are 3 week-day and 4 Sab-
bath day schools. At the time of the former Statistical Account,
there were 4 houses in the parish where ale and spirits were sold,
and now there is only 1.
