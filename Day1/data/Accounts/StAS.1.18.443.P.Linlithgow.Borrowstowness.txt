next the town were foreseen to be very expensive.  It was
judged prudent to have a new survey by that eminent en-
gineer, Mr Robert Whitworth; who reported, "That to
"complete the canal properly, L. 17,000 would be wanted."
By this time, not L. 4000 good money remained, and the
work was relinquished, till new funds should be raised;
which unfortunately have never yet been procured, and when
they shall be obtained, is at present uncertain.  The return of
peace, with a reviving commerce, may perhaps encourage
former subscribers, or animate new ones, to finish a work of
public utility; and which would be of so much local advan-

   It is highly probable, that all the low ground in the parish,

have been a vast accession to the carse grounds of the parish.
But the project failed, and a large extent of ground remains

the fastidiousness and indolence of mankind.
   It appears, as far as the writer of this account has had an
opportunity to learn, that the natives of the town and parish
of Bo-ness, are fond of a sea-faring life.  Many able-bodied
seamen from this place, are at present in his Majesty's service;
and are distinguished for their sobriety, courage, and loyalty.
Adventurers from the place, are also to be found in the most
distant parts of the globe.-The inhabitants of the town are
