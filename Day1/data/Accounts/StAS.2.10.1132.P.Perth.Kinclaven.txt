        <TABLE III.-POPULATION>

        Like many other agricultural parishes, the population is on the
	decrease.
		In 1755, by Dr Webster's account, the population was 993
		In Sir John Sinclair's in 1790,                     1150
		Ill 1801, by census,                                1035
		In  1311,                                           1066
		In  1821,                                            986
		In  1831,                                            890
		In  1841,                                            878
	This decreasd in  the population, since the beginning of the pre-
	sent century, has  been owing to emigration, to the enlargement of
	farms, and more recently to the removal of a number of families
	to the thriving village of Stanley, in the immediate neighbourbood,
	with the view of finding employment for their children at the ex-
	tensive cotton factory established there.

        habited houses, 8.
	   There is one insane person, and one fatuous.
	   In regard to language and personal appearance, there is nothing
	peculiar in the inhabitants of this parish.  The prevailing names
	are Duncan, Watson, Young, and Galletly.  In some families
	there seems to be a very strong hereditary attachment to their na-
	tive soil, several of the farms and pendicles having descended from
	father to son, from time immemorial.  The natural consequence is,
	that they are closely connected by intermarriages, especially the
	Dissenters.
