latter, moss is plentiful.  Indeed the people of isle Muck get
great part of their fuel, and summer grass for their horses,
in Rum, as a gratuity, during pleasure, from its proprietor
to the proprietor of isle Muck, who is a cadet of his family.
Some benefit may result to Canna from its harbour, which
is much frequented by the trade from the Baltic and its
neighbourhood.  It might be expected that Rum would
largely share in this benefit, if its harbour was generally
known.
   The disadvantages of this parish are not few.  In this ex-
tensive parish, consisting of so many islands, where the navi-
gation is tedious and dangerous, especially to the islands

from the harbour of Eigg to the harbour of Canna, being
computed 30 miles; to that of Rum 16, and to that of isle
Muck, 6 miles: His attendance on each cannot be so fre-

require.  Notwithstanding his exertions, the people must be
liable to a seduction into a superstition, subversive of morali-
ty and of genuine piety; and the more so, as its emissaries,
now tolerated by law, traffic among them without controul.
Hence the necessity of establishing amission in two of these
islands is thought evident.  The want of schools is another
disadvantage.  The ambulatory school, once established in
this parish, by the Society in Scotland for Propagating Chris-

fixed in Eigg, and the only one in the parish.  From this
school, children in the other islands, especially the poorer
sort can derive no benefit.  Ignorance must be the conse-
quence, and they may not only be an easy prey to seducers,
but worse qualified to act their past as useful members of so-
