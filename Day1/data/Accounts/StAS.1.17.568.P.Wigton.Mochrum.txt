     Statistical Account

   Black Cattle.-The black cattle are not large, but very
handsome, as these bred in Galloway in general are.  The
whole number in the parish may be about 1500.  Every
farmer rears as many as he can, and no more thinks of fat-
ting and killing a calf, than would an ancient inhabitant of
Egypt.
   The cattle are usually sold, at two years of age, for 5 L.
a-head, to graziers or jobbers, and are mostly all, sooner or
later, driven to the English markets.
   As the chief quality regarded in a cow is to be a good
breeder, so no great attention is paid to milk, or manufac-
turing of it into butter and cheese; yet of these articles
enough are made for the use of the inhabitants,
   Some of the farmers, however, from a laudable desire of
improving in this respect, have more than once introduced
here the famous cows of Kyle.  But, whether it was owing
to a difference of pasture, of hard feeding, or of both, these
were soon found to milk no better than the native breed;
and, being less esteemed in other respects, especially on ac-
count of their being horned, very few of them are now to
be seen.  When the cows get old, they are sold lean for be-
tween 3 L. and 4 L. except what are retained for the use of
the parishioners; and these, when fatted, commonly weigh
from 25 to 30 stones.

   Sheep.-This parish has long been famous for excellent
wool, on account of its still retaining some of the ancient
breed of the Galloway sheep.  Of these sheep, the most dis-
tinguishing marks are, orange coloured face and legs, short
thick wool, and very small size.  When at full growth, and
tolerably fat, the wedder would not exceed 30, nor the ewe
27 lib.; and it would require 18 or 20 of their fleeces to
make a stone of 26 1/2 lib.
