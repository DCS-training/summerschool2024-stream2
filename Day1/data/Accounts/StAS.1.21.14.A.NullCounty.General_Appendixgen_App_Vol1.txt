attends according to the intimation, can assess for the poor.
They are not suffered to want on account of the negligence
of heritors, and the deed of the minister is valid.
   The weekly collections in the church are, by law, the pro-
perty of the session, for behoof of the poor; and are usually
given to such as are known by the minister and elders to be
in necessitous circumstances, and who through modesty do
not apply for the legal provision.
   There are no records of the poor rates farther back than
the year 1749.  That year 10 names are on the roll.  The
highest sum given to one person per quarter is 9 s: the total
sum is L. 3: 3.  The list of names from that time does not

a year of great scarcity, the names on the roll are 11, and 7

belonging to the poor, and out of that fund they bought up
oat meal and bear-meal, and sold it to the poor on the roll,
and to others who could produce a line from the minister of
their necessitous situation, at 2 d per stone below market price.
In the year 1759, the price of victual was greatly fallen.  Those
on the roll being only 9, and for interim supply 4; the sum
to the whole is L. 4: 16.  In the year 1767, the number of
poor is 14; the sum assessed for L. 3: 16.  In the year 1783,
a year also of scarcity, the number of poor is 19, including
those for interim supply; the sum assess d L. 12: 10: 3.  In
1784, the number of poor is 14; the sum assessed L. 10: 11.
In 1790, the number of poor is 13; the sum assessed
L. 10: 19: 6.  The highest pension to one person is L. 1: 19,
