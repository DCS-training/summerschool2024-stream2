     Statistical Account

   In the year 1635, and for a long time after, this parish
appears to have been a wild and uncultivated track of
country, and thinly peopled.  Even so late as the year
1709, it contained only 318 examinable persons.  Since
that time, however, the lands have been inclosed, and so
much cultivated, that it is now become one of the most
productive parts of the country.  The number of inhabi-
tants has of course been considerably augmented, and is at
present upon the increase, from the enlargement of the
metropolis, and the advancement of manufactures.
   The numerous mills erected for flour and barley; the
mills for the manufacture of flax, paper, tobacco, and the
wauking of cloth; the skinnery manufacture; the bleach-
ing fields; a flourishing distillery; a manufacture of mag-
nesia; and the great quarries of Hailes and Redhall; have
brought together, of late years, into this parish, a concourse
of people, and a degree of opulence formerly unknown.
   Seventeen years ago, only 25 persons were employed in
the manufacture of paper: At present, 92 persons are occu-
pied in the parish in that manufacture, who, with their fa-
milies, amount to about 300 people.
   The whole parish is now estimated at more than three
rents above what it was in the year 1709.
   The hill of Caerketan-craig, in this parish, the most
northerly of the Pentland Hills, is 1450 feet high above
the level of the sea; and the hill of Capelaw, situated to
the westward of it, may be about 100 feet higher.  The
Logan-house Hill, lying still further west in the range, and
the highest of the Pentland Hills, was found, by geometri-
cal mensuration, and by repeated barometrical observations,
to be 1700 feet high above the level of the sea at Leith,
which is only 60 feet less than one-third of a measured
mile.
