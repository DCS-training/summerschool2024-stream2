plainly shews, that forest deer, and the other animals, now so
little known, once frequented this part of the country.

   Rivers and Fish.-The river Ern, or Earn, flows from a beauti-
ful lake, in a neighbouring parish to the westward, and glides
along the north and east side of the parish, in a meandering
course, for many miles.  It gives name to one of the most beau-
tiful vales in Scotland, called Strathern.
   Besides the Ern, there are in this parish the rivers, or wa-
ters, of Machany, Knaick, and Allan; all of which abound
with fine trouts, of a large size.  In some parts of the Ern,
there are pike; and, in some seasons of the year, great num-
bers of sea trouts, from 3 lb. to 6 lb, weight.  The fisherman call
them whitlings, on account of the scales they have, at their
first coming up the river from the sea.  They are reckoned
an excellent fish at the tables of the gentry; and afford good
sport to the angler with fly.  Large salmon are found in this
river, as high as up Lochern, although there no less than 5 dikes,
quite across from bank to bank, at the distance of some miles
from one another, with wooden traps in the middle, where
the water runs deepest, for catching the salmon, and the
larger sea trouts, in their way up the river.  These traps are,
or ought to be, taken up every week, from Saturday evening
till Monday morning; which are the only times these fish can
pass through, unless the river is so full as to allow them to over-
leap the dikes, which seldom happens during the fishing sea-
son.  Below the dikes, near the junction of the Ern and the
Tay, there are salmon fishing places, which rent at a high
price.

   Lakes Roads, and Bridges.-The lake above mentioned, is
called the Loch of Balloch, and is the only one in the parish.
It is about half a mile round, and from it flows a small stream,
