last is effectually obviated by inoculation, to which the most
scrupulous and prejudiced are now almost universally recon-
ciled.  Only, in some cases, its design has been defeated,
and its credit much injured, either by injudicious practice,
when the patient has been afflicted with some other acute
disorder; or by the discontinuance of proper attention and
medicines, when the disease has been supposed at an end, but
its malignant remains of resorbed virulent matter, still latent
in the blood, have again broke out in some other form, more
hostile to the constitution, and fatal in the issue.-As to

and the breeding and management of sheep and black cattle.
Hence their servants and horses are chiefly intended for, and

are to judge by its consequences.  When a little capricious des-
pot of this kind has fixed the stamp of exaction, upon those
ranks of society whom the law exempts, he may, if he pleas-
