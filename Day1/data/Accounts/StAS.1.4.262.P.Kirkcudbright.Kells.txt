number, size, and situation of these loose rocks, are a great
natural curiosity.  At the end of these hills, in the same
direction, is another rocky hill, containing great quantities
of iron-stone; but, as fuel is scarce, and coal distant, it
cannot be turned to any advantage.  These hills are the
natural soil for goats.  On the west side, and north end od
the parish, the hills are still higher, covered with grass
but of a bad quality.  These hills are called the Kells
Range, and are seen at 40 miles distance; so high, that
there is snow upon them for 8, and sometimes 9 months in
the year.  They are the very ridge or highest land in Gal-
loway, and the middle between the two seas on the W.
and S. E.  As a proof of this, the rivers Ken and Dee,
which rise on the east side, run to the S. E. sea at Kirk-
cudbright; and the Don, which rises on the N. W. side
of these, runs to the sea near Ayr.  These are a part of a
range of high hills, running from W. to E. by Leadhills,
the whole breadth of Scotland.  There is a great natural
curiosity to be seen on the side of one of these hills.  The
Rocking Stone, of 8 or 10 tons weight, so nicely balanced
on 2 or 3 points or excrescences, that it moves from one to
the other, by the pressine of the finger.  Captain Grosse,
last harvest, sent and took a drawing of it; and some anti-
quaries think it has been a Druidical place of worship.  It
should seem that the stone was formed by nature, just as
we see it; and lying on a strata of moss, 2 or 3 inches deep,
the rains have in time washed away this moss or earth, and
lest the stone resting on these points.

   Minerals.-There is a state quarry in the north end of
this parish formerly wrought, but, by unskilful manage-
ment, has fallen into disrepute,  If sunk  deeper, and skil-
fully wrought, it might be valuable, and supersede the use
of English state, brought hither at a great expence.  The
