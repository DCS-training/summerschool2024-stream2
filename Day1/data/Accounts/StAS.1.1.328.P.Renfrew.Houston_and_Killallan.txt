entry into the area, arched above, and secured by a port cul-
lis.  The building was a real fortification; being large, and
built on an elevated situation, it had a lordly appearance,
overlooking the whole plain towards Paisley and Glasgow.
About 10 years ago it was demolished, except the east side.
Mr Macrae, who was then the proprietor, desiring to have
the old village near it removed to a greater distance, feued
ground for building a new village; and, to encourage the peo-
ple to build, he gave them the stones of the mansion-house
gratis.  The tower was so thick, and the stone and lime so
strongly cemented, that they were obliged to blast it with gun-
powder.  Mr Macrae proposed at that time to build a new
house for himself, or to make an addition to the side that was
then standing, and was the newest part of the whole; but that
plan was never executed; and the whole is now a ruin.  Ther
building is said to have been originally a religious house of
Monks of the Cistertian order.

   In an aile adjoining to the east end of the church are seve-
ral sepulchral monuments; particularly a magnificent tomb of
neat workmanship, in free stone.  In the front, under a cano-
py, resembling an alcove bed, are placed two statues as big as
the life:  The one is said to be an effigy of Sir Patrick Hous-
toun of that IIk, who died in the year 1450; and the other
of his lady Annes Campbell, who died in the year 1456.
The one representing Sir Patrick is dressed in a coat of mail,
his head lying on a pillow, and his feet on a lion with a wide
mouth, holding a lamb in his paws under him.  The image
of the lady is dressed as in grave clothes, neatly cut in stone.
Both their hands are elevated, as in a praying or supplicating
posture.  Round the verge of the tomb there is an inscription
in Saxon contain, but so much effaced, that little of it can be
distincly read.
