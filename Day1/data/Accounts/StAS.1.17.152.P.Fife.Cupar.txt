fatally it sometimes operates, as an encouragement to idle-
ness, and check to industry; whoever has paid attention to
these circumstances, would never wish to see poor's rates esta-
blished in Scotland.  Yet, every one who has been, during
any considerable length of time, concerned in the manage-
ment of a parish fund in this country, must frequently, from
the imperfection and inconsistency of our acts of Parliament
relating to this business, have felt himself difficulted, and
must have wished for a new law, containing proper regula-
tions on this subject, so very important and interesting to so-
ciety-particularly for a statute, defining accurately these
two points:

land understand their own interest if they entertain a deep and
grateful sense of the prudence and purity, and disinterestedness
of ministers and kirk-sessions, in the management of the funds
belonging to the poor intrusted to their care; if they are inte-
rested in the comfort of, those with whose welfare their own
prosperity is intimately connected-while they reprobate paro-
chial assessments, and all their baleful consequences to society,
they will chearfully follow the only plan, which, in many pa-
rishes, can prevent their establishment-they will regularly con-
tribute, on the Lord's Day to the relief of the poor in those
parishes where their property lies, whether they reside or not,
and whether or not they attend public worship.
