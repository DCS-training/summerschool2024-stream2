   Manufactures.-Coarse woollen cloths and stuffs are made
for household-use, but in no great quantity.  Linen is also
made for wearing apparel.  The principal manufactures
carried on here, are knitting stockings, and spinning linen
yarn.  In the first of these they greatly excel, and from
constant practice, make the stockings very smooth and glossy.
Young girls of 10 or 12 years of age can knit well.  A great
part of these stockings is sold to sailors at 1 s. 6 d. to 5 s.
a pair.  They have been made so fine as to sell for 10 s. or
15 s. a pair.
