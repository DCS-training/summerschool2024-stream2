of Tamrawer, anciently Graham's, two farms of good arable land,
lying east of Lower Banton, to the north of Kelvinhead and the
great canal.
  The sixth is Mr Watters, who lately bought Inchterff, the most
westerly land in the parish, upon the banks of the Kelvin, bound-
ed by that river on the south, and by Auchinreoch, in Campsie, on

red moss formerly referred to, which is quite worthless, lying in a
dead level, and upon a bad kind of clay.  Inchterff is almost in-
sulated, as regards the other lands of Kilsyth parish, being within
a mile and a half of Kirkintilloch town.  Annual rent, L.220.
  The seventh heritor is His Grace the Duke of Montrose, who
has two excellent grazing farms on the south side of the Carron,
being the chief part of Dundaff lands, Burnhouse, and Claharry
and Slachristock.  Value L.460 per annum.  The first, let to
David Ure at L.150, way keep 15 score of ewes, and 60 black-
cattle.  The second, let to James Ewing at L.310, may keep
15 score ewes, and, 150 black-cattle.
