     Statistical Account

   The rotation of crops in the greatest part of the parish
is usually as follows:  In the 1st year of breaking up land
oats are sown; 2d year fallow or potatoes; the land is ma-
nured; 3 d year wheat; 4th year barlev, or sometimes oats,
with rye grass and red clover; 5th year rye grass and clover;
6th year, the preceding rotation is recommenced.  Oats are
the prevailing grain.  The best arable land in the parish near
Dumfries is rented at L. 1:  10:  0 per acre:  There are sow at

Wheat and barley are usually reaped in the beginning of Sep-

the servitude of tennants, and bailie work, to the proprietors of
land, is now almost entirely abolished in this parish.  It was
a cruel mode of oppression.
