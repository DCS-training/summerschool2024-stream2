     of Kintore.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people are in general
peaceable, and not given to feuds or divisions, charitable
and industrious, strangers to luxury and vice; and in the
Royal Burgh, not much given to political speculations.
There are only two public houses or taverns in the parish,
and these are necessary in Kintore for the great north road.
The advantages of the parish are, good soil near the river,
easily managed, and producing crops without manure; the 
sobriety and industry of the people, and access to Aberdeen,
the principal market, not being difficult, and that there
are few services, or what is called bondage, required.
The disadvantages are these already pointed out, from the
overflowing of the river, nearness to Aberdeen, raising
wages more than in places at a distance, short leases, none
of them above 19 years, though the heritors are not dispo-
sed to remove their tenants.  It is said, the entail upon the
lands of Kintore restricts from giving longer leases than
19 years.  Improper division of farms is likewise a disad-
vantage, rents not being exactly proportioned, and that
there is in many farms a want of stocking, owing to the po-
verty of the farmers.-If there are any mines in this coun-
try, they must be of Iron, for all mineral springs here are
impregnated with iron-ore, and some of our stones are co-
loured by the water; yet the stones here are generally of
the best granite.  Outliers, as they are called, abounding
in quantity, are more used than quarries, because they are
both more easily got at, and taking them away, clears the 
ground.-There are few Dissenters from the Established 
Church in the parish, only 2 families of Nonjurors, and 
1 of Seceders.  The living and dress of the country-people
are much better within the last fifty years, and even since
I was settled at Kintore.  Instead of country made stuff,
which men formerly wore, they now purchase cloth at
Aberdeen, and the women now use cardinals of different
