writing, 3s.; and with arithmetic, 3s. 6d.; Latin or French, 5-.;
practical mathematics, 5s.
   There is hardly a house in the parish so situated as to make it
a matter of much hardship for a child of six or seven years of age
to attend some school. The numbers in actual attendance, com-
pared with the population, show that the people in general are
alive to the benefits of education. The Academy being free to
the children of all parishioners, no additional school is needed in
this parish, though an additional teacher in the Academy would
be of great advantage. But the funds do not at present admit of
the addition.
   Literature.-Connected with the Academy, there is a library
for the use of the pupils, containing above 700 volumes, chiefly
suited to youth. There is also a subscription library in the town,
recently begun, and now containing above 280 volumes.
   Friendly Societies.-There are seven such societies in the pa-
rish; one, still the largest, instituted some years previous to 1734;
the others respectively in 1759, 1792, 1799, 1806, 1809, and
1810. They are all supported by annual payments from the
members, who amount to 969. They are all intended for the
support of the Members in sickness and old age. Some of them
also pay a certain sum for the funeral charges of the members.
These societies are of vast benefit to the members; and though
it may well be doubted whether they promote industry, they help
to cherish among them a spirit of independence.
   Savings Bank.-There has been a savings bank here since
1827. A view of its operations for the last six years shows these
results:

    Deposited,  L. 160   L.  74   L. 210   L. 218   L. 288   L. 272
    Drawn out,     130      211      252      333      245      318

At the last balancing of the books, there was in the bank L. 629,
10s. The investments are chiefly made by servants, weavers,
mechanics, &c.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The poor are not more numerous
than might be expected in such a population as that of Bathgate,
though it must be acknowledged that unwillingness to apply for
parochial relief is on the decline, and that relatives in many in-
stances seem to feel little annoyance at those near to them becom-
ing the objects of public charity.
