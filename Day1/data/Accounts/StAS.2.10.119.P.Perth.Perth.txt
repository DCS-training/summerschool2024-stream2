            It is very much to be lamented that the liberality and harmony
          which, a fdw years ago, prevailed among all classes and denomina-
          tions of the community, in the formation and upholding of these and
          other such valuable institutions, have suffered a considerable dimi-
          nution.  This lamentable evil I unhesitatingly ascribe to the intro-
          duction of voluntaryism into the place, the object of which is to
          overthrow the religious establishments of the country. It has oc-
          casioned a grievous infringement of the royal law of our Master's
          kingdom, "brotherly love." It has produced a separation among
          brethren in matters upon which they should be cordially united.
          May the time soon return when Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and                                       (I
          Judah shall not vex Ephraim.
            The state of the public charities of the city of Perth for 1833,
          is published in the Church of Scotland Magazine for 1835.  As
          that is, to my certain knowledge, accurate, and as it has been freely
          circulated in this place, as well as in other places, that the chari-
          table institutions in our chief towns owe more to the liberality of
          Dissenters than to that of the Establishment, I beg leave here to
          introduce it.

             This was the state of matters in 1833. Since then, the average
           contribution by the Establishment has increased to those Societies
           which continue in existence.
             The average amount of church collections yearly for religious
           and charitable objects is about L. 730.
             Education.-Perth is the most centrical town in Scotland.  It
           is not matter of surprise, therefore, that in 1697 when, with a view
           to the public interest of the nation, it was proposed to remove the
           University of St Andrews to another place, this city should be
           made choice of, and particularly as it is more accessible than St
           Andrews to the population of the highland districts . A corre-
           spondence upon the subject was, for some time, carried on by Sir
