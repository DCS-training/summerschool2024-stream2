that might have been expected, the mode of farming is much
changed.  Instead of 6 horses in a plough, they never use
more than 4, and many use only 2, without a driver.  Some
plow with 6 oxen, some with 4, and some with 2; but the
horses and oxen are of a much larger size than formerly, and
the Berwick-shire plough is now generally used.

   Produce, Seasons, etc.-The crops now raised are oats,
weighing from 14 to 16 stone, Amsterdam weight; bear from
17 to 19 stone; beans, pease, turnips, potatoes, and a little
flax.  The season of sowing is from the latter end of March
to the beginning of June; and the harvest commonly begins
after the middle of September, and is finished about the end
of October.  The rotation of crops, followed by the best far-
mers, is turnips or fallow, bear laid down with grass seeds,
and after 3 or 4 years in grass, two crops of oats are
taken.  If, after this, the ground is clean, beans are sown, but
if otherwise, turnips or potatoes, and then bear and grass seeds.
Wheat has been neglected, although it is well adapted to the
soil; but as the heritor has kept some good farms in his own
hand, (when the tenants have died, or removed of their own
accord,) to accommodate farmers from those countries where
wheat is cultivated, it is to be hoped, that this grain will in
a few years make a principal part of the crop of this parish.
The greatest part of the soil here being a strong clay, and
all of it on a rich clay bottom, it is clear, that the carse
mode of plowing and cropping would succeed well here.
When this mode is introduced, the true value of this soil
will be known.

   Farm Rents and Improvements.-The tenants being nu-
merous, the rents are various.  Some pay 90 L. in money and
grain; and some 2 L. or perhaps even less.  Every man who has
