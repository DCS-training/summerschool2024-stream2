therto this has been followed by no bad consequence to their
manners, because the excess of their wages has been spent
an innocent, if not useful, profusion in their appearance.

ago, in this parish and neighbourhood, there were seven brew-
eries, where at present there are only two; and each of the seven
brought more ale to the market than both the present ones do.
It is evident, that, in the same period, the consumption of spi-
rits must have proportionally increased; and it is an indispu-
table fact, that the use of spirituous liquors gives the prospect
of unlimited excess.  The progress towards this horrid state is
more imperceptible in the country than in large towns; be-
cause, in the latter, the daily, and even hourly, price of labour,
supplies the constant means; and, in the former, sobriety is, in
all cases, a more important recommendation; but the habit of
drinking spirits will finally overcome every sentiment of honour
and ambition in the human character.  It must be allowed at
the same time, that the depravity of the individual may be the
temporary riches of the state, when depravity is the subject of
taxation; but no man of integrity would desire to fee a rich
Exchequer, and a weak, enervated, and debauched people.
Nothing can be of the smallest service for the cure of this evil,
but that which effectually raises the price of spirits, and makes
ale a more palatable and substantial beverage.
