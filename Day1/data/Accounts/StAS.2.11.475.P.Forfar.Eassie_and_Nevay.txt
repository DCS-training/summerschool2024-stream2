			PARISH OF EASSIE AND NEVAY.

		PRESBYTERY OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND, MEARNS.

			THE REV. JAMES FLOWERDEW, MINISTER.


                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
        Boundaries, &c.-THESE united parishes are bounded on the
east and south, by Glammis; on the south-west, by Newtyle;
and, on the west and north, by Meigle and Airly. They are
about 4 miles long and 3 broad, and contain an area of 8 square
miles. The Deane forms the northern boundary of Eassie. This
stream, as its name is said to import, is of considerable depth, and
has a scarcely perceptible current. On the south side, it is strongly
embanked; but, owing to the sudden and frequent bends in its
course, it often, in winter, breaks through the embankment and
inundates the neighbouring fields.
        Mineralogy and Botany.-The Mineralogy and botany of these
parishes are so similar to those of the adjoining parish of Glam-
mis, that any description of them would only be a repetition of
the observations of the scientific gentleman who furnished the mi-
neralogical and botanical portion of the account of that parish.
No specimens, however, of the fossil and organic remains, that
have been found in it at various times, have ever been discovered
in this parish. The rocks are of the same old sandstone forma-
tion; the colours, being gray and brownish-red. The dip of the
beds is to the north-west; and the character of the rocks varids from
conglomerate, through the usual gradations, down to calmstone.
