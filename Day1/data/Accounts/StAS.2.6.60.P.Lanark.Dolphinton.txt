any means stationary. Enclosing, planting, draining, levelling,
and liming are yet carried on by all the proprietors. Wet lands,
formerly not worth half-a-crown an acre, yield, by being convert-
ed into water-meadows, 200, 300, or 400 stones of valuable hay.
Till of late years the water-courses were narrow and crooked; but
now they are widened, deepened, and made strait. One cut alone
for the Medwin, from Newholm to Walston Mill, cost near
L. 1000, and afforded the means to the different proprietors inte-
rested of laying dry 600 Scotch statute acres, which it was former-
ly impossible to drain. In a word, every encouragement is given
to improvement by the proprietors: and no proprietors in this dis-
trict are adding more every year to the value of their estates.

	Pasture, rating it at L. 3 per cow, and allowing 2 acres for each cow,
    200 cows,                                                                   600 0 0

        Young cattle raised,-young horses bred,-grass seeds, swine, and other
    articles of which no particular account can be had, sold annually, say,     500 0 0
                                                                           * L. 750 0 0

<FOOTNOTE>At first sight, a landlord might reasonably be startled at receiving only L.1700 of
rental from nearly L.6000 worth of produce, but from this amount there falls to be
deducted,

For fee and maintenance of 50 servants, say only at L. 15 each,	      L. 750 0 0
For keep of cattle, young and old,300, at L. 5 each,                    1500 0 0
For seed-corn, 700 bolls, at 16s.                                        560 0 0
For horse's feed, equal to seed,                                         560 0 0
For seed-potatoes at 4 bolls per acre, for 60 acres,                      70 0 0
For rent,                                                               1700 0 0
                                                                     L. 5140 0 0
	There thus appears to be a very small surn, indeed, for carrying the surplus pro-
duce of the whole parish to market; keeping up houses, offices, fences, harness, ploughs,
barrows, carts, &c.--for maintaining, clothing, and educating children,--for sustain-
ing all losses by death of live-stock failure of crop, fluctuation of markets, and bank.
ruptay of dealers,--for interest on capital sunk, and remuneration for work done by
both husband and wife. Of old, when farming was profitable, three rents was the
ruk by which land was taken, one to the landlord, one to the farm, and the other to
the servants smith, wright, saddler, &c. But now that a rise has taken place in fees
of servants and wages of mechanics, little less than four rents will enable a farmer to
" pay day and wat."
