the high custom-house duty at Montrose, our people go
sometimes to Arbroath, which is at least 4 statute miles

   Roads and Bridges.-The roads within the parishes, though
greatly improved within these last 20 years, are still but

years ago, there was neither a spinning wheel nor a reel
within the parishes.  The rock and the spindle were then

can with as much ease at this day, spin 12 hiers, as a woman
could have spun 3 1/2 hiers then.  A hiers is 240 threads, or
rounds of the reel, each of them 91 inches long.  About 
50 years ago, neither buckles were used for shoes, nor metal
buttons for clothes.  There were then very few carts with-
