   Benevis.-This mountain is 4370 feet high.-It is easily
ascended, by a ridge of the mountain, towards the west,
about a quarter of a mile up the river Nevis, from the house

here, as well as on the surrounding hills, for a great way up.
The view is entirely confined within Glenevis hill, till you

tended their herds and flocks, amidst the beauties of Arcadia.

part of Mull, together with the islands of Suile and Kerrera,
on the opposite coast of Argyll.  At this altitude, two ele-
vated hills make their appearance over there isles; which, by
their shape, declare themselves to be the Paps of Fura.
Turning to the west, and inclining a little towards the north,
