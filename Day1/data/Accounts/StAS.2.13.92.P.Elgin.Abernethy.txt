                      PARISH OF ABERNETHY.

              PRESBYTERY OF ABERNETHY, SYNOD OF MORAY.

                 THE REV. DONALD MARTIN, MINISTER.


	I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Extent, Boundaries.-The parish of Kincardine has been
united to this parish; and both lie on the south-east side of the
river Nethy.  The parish extends from the borders of Cromdale
to Rotbiemurchus. The river Spey, expanded apparently to its
greatest magnitude, glides onward in a smooth unruffled course,
from Rothiemurchus till it meets the district of Moray, near the
middle of Abernethy, the lower end of which parish falls within the
county of Inverness.
   Topographical appearances, &c.-The mountains of Cairngorm
(the blue mountains) rise to a conspicuous elevation on the southern
boundary of the parish.  They are seldom wholly free from snow.
The forests cannot extend themselves to a great height on their
sides.  There are beautiful topaz stones of all colours found on
these hills, capable of being polished for ornamenting rings and
finishing seals.
   There are several lakes in the parish.  That of Glenmore in
Kincardine is nearly circular, and about 2 miles in diameter.  It
occupies the middle of an aged forest of firs, which, when sold by
the late Duke of Gordon, was considered to be of the largest and
best timber in Scotland; and the progress of a new growth of tim-
ber in the forest is now so great that the result must one day be
very profitable.  The lake discharges into the Spey a stream which
has a course of 6 miles.  In this quarter, there is a lake in the
hollow of a mountain, which neither takes in nor emits any stream;
but the rocky banks rise around to a great height, and are clothed
with the ever verdant pine.  This lake is stored with abundance of
fat trout.
   The Nethy, from which the parish takes its name, is only a brook
in dry weather; but is occasionally swelled to such a degree as to
float down timber to the saw-mills or to the Spey.
