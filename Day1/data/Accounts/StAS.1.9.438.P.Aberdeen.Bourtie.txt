   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The advantages are
the sobriety of the inhabitants, (not an alehouse being in
the parish), and the diligence of the women in knitting
stockings.  They are far from lime, and it requires a con-
siderable share of their summer labour to provide fuel.*

<FOOTNOTE>

*The rise of farm servants wages is very remarkable.  When the pre-
gent incumbent was fettled in 1744, the half year's wage of men servants
from 8 s. to 15 s. Sterling.  The present rate is from L. 2, 10 s. to
L. 8, 15 s. Sterling.
