   Vegetable Produce.-The great, and indeed almost the
only vegetable produce, are bear and oats.  These are sown
in continual alternate rotation, without the intervention of
any other crop.  This practice must surely be unfavour-
able to the field, the crop, the quality of the grain, and ex-
pose the farmer to more trouble and expence, for reasons
well known.  No great attempts have yet been made to
raise pease and green crops, such as turnips, etc.  Yet I
have reason to think, from the good success that attended
the few trials which have been made, that they would
prosper well.  It is, indeed, great matter of surprise, that,
in a parish where the support and credit of the people al-
most entirely depends on their cow and their grain, they
should deny themselves this great advantage.  For, besides
the benefits that would be derived from these crops to
themselves and their cattle, they would moreover enable
them to keep a greater number of cattle, which they would
like well, and occasion that rotation of crops so much wanted
for the benefit of the field, and its produce.  Want of inclo-
sures and winter-herding are, as has been already observed,
two great causes why the people do not avail themselves of
this great advantage.  Besides, being unaccountably averse to
any thing that is strange or novel in this way, they cannot
he persuaded to trust their credit and their prospects to such
crops.  Great quantities of potatoes are indeed of late years
raised in this parish, from which they derive very consi-
derable advantages, especially as they contribute much to
make the living cheaper.
   Oats.-The oats raised generally is of two kinds, black and
grey, of a small body, very prolific, but not productive of any
great proportion of meal.  In some parts of the parish, in good
years, the proportion is more than 9 stones of meal out
of 1 1/2 bolls undried grain; in other parts, not above 6 stones
out of the same measure of grain.  Of late years, other
