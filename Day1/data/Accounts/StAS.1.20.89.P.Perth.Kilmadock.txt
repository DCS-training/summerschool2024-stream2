volent father of a numerous family, and a bright luminary
to Scotland.

   Post-office and Carriers.-There was lately established a
post-office in Doune and Callander, with a runner between
these towns and Dunblane every Sunday, Tuesday, and
Friday, which is of great use.
   There is also a weekly carrier from Doune to Stirling,
another to Callander, another to Dunblane, and sometimes
one to Kippen.

   Antiquities.-The Castle of Doune is the most eminent
antiquity in this district.
   The ancient monastery of St Madocus, now called Kil-
madock, where the late church stood, is quite demolished,
and perhaps was pulled down to build the church.  To this
monastery belonged six chapels within the parish.
   The first stood on the south banks of Teith, at the end
of the bridge, where part of the building is still to be seen.
The adjoining lands, now the property of Mr John Forrest,
were annexed to this chapel, and hence received the name
Dean's-town.
   The second stood on the south-east of the house of Row,
also close by the north side of Teith, part of the foundation
whereof is still visible.
   The third chapel stood on the west brink of the glen of
Annat, on a round hill, which still retains the name of the
Kirk-hill, and the marks of graves are still visible.  The
name Annat has its origin from this chapel; Ann or Annat
meaning the first fruits of every benefice; and the lands of
Annat were perhaps at that time annexed to the chapel.
   The fourth was at Lanerick, and the remains of the
building has been for a long period used as a burying-place
