     Of Closeburn.

Nith, which forms the western boundary of the parish, is
to be found a fine rich loamy soil.  To the eastward, the
ground rises a little, and the soil becomes light, dry, and
sandy.  Farther on, in the same direction, the ground rises
still more, and there the soil is strong and deep, with a mix-
ture of clay; to the eastward of this again are extensive
moors, unsit for tillage, but affording very good pasture for
sheep.  The rental of the parish is about L. 3500.  The 
farmers are rather unwilling to publish the stock and crop
upon their farms; but according to the nearest calculation,
the amount of the whole may be about 11,000 sheep, 1200
black cattle, and 250 horses, all ages included.

   Sheep.-The sheep generally kept are the short black-
faced kind, and the farmers seem to have no inclination to
change the breed, but are at pains to improve it.  It is
computed that every score of such sheep will yield ful-
ly 3 stones of wool; of course, there ought to be 1650
stones produced in the parish annually; but, owing to a num-
ber of sheep of one and two years old being sold off before
the time of sheep-shearing, the quantitiy actually produced
does not much exceed 1400 stones.  The wool is generally
sold at 6 s. or 7 s. the stone; but it has lately become a prac-
tice with several of the farmers in this and the neighbour-
ing parishes to wash their sheep before they are clipped.
This no doubt lessens the weight of their wool, but it brings
them a price for it so much higher, as more than to com-
pensate for the loss of weight, and for the trouble of wash-
ing; wool, which otherwise would not have brought more
than 6 s. the stone, being washed in this manner will bring
8 s.*
