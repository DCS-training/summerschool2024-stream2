House, some of whom were 40 years of age, and not one
died.  The people, though strongly attached to their old
customs, submit to this operation with a degree of readiness
which does them credit.  The scurvy does not prevail so
much here as in some of the other parishes of this country.
Convulsion fits are unknown.
   The coasts of there parishes are, for the most part, bold
and rocky.  We have no rivers.  There are a few lakes
and rivulets, in which excellent trout are sometimes caught.
In Bressay there are 26 large fishing boats, in Quarff 5.
They are sitted out at a considerable expence; and the ave-
rage number of ling in a season for each boat may be about
300.  There are, besides, a number of small boats.  In Bur-

fitted out at little expence.  In winter they fish for sillocks,
small cod, haddocks, etc.  A few tons of kelp are annually
made from the sea ware.

not afford to keep ploughs.  Besides, many of them are of

only one peat deep, they first take off the grass, sods, lay them
carefully asides then dig up the peats; after which they lay
the sods upon a fine clair bottom, press them down with their
feet, sod afterwards have good crops of grass and corn upon
