ling that of Lochleven.  The waters, Borthwick and Ale,
augmented in their course by a great number of rivulets,
abound with trouts of the best quality; but it is only in the
spawning season that they are visited by salmon.

   Game, Woods, and Mosses.  The diversion of shooting may
here be as much enjoyed as that of angling, as there is plenty
