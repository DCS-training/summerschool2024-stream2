     Statistical Account

under the general name Glenprosen, may contain 24 or 30
square miles.  The face  of the country is various.  For about
a mile to the N. of the parishes of Glammis and Forfar, it
is almost flat.  Then it rises gently about 2 miles more, form-
ing almost one continued sloping bank, till within a few hun-
dred yards of the town, which stands nearly in the centre of
the southern part of the parish, and is separated by a narrow
valley or den, about 100 feet deep, from the above bank.
To the E. and W. of the town, it is almost level.  The rest
of the parish is beautifully diversified with hills, and dales,
rivers, woods, and plains.  The hills, however, those in
Glenprosen excepted, are of no great elevation, and are either
cultivated, or planted, or afford tolerable pasture.  Glen-
prosen is altogether hilly and mountainous.  A few of the
hills are covered with grass, except on their summits; and a
few of them are rocky; but they are, in general, covered
with heath, interspersed, however, with innumerable patches
of grass, probably produced by the many rills which tumble
down their sides.  Some of these hills are intersected by ri-
vulets which have their source in the glens formerly men-
tioned; and in the glens are several hundred acres of flat
mossy ground, partly covered with bent and rough grass,
which afford good pasture for young cattle during the sum-
mer months, as the hills do for sheep.  In Glenprosen, the
soil is partly thin and light, partly mossy, and, in general,
wet.  In the southern part of the parish, are all kinds of
soil; but a black mould, on a bottom of mortar, predominates.
This, when dry, produces heavy crops of all kinds of grain;
but being in many places wet and spongy, the harvest is often
late, and the grain of rather an inferior quality.

in Clova, forms the N. E. boundary of this parish for about
