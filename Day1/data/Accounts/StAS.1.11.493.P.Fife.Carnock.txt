for draining it.  There are many veins of this coal, several
feet thick, partly above level and partly below.  It is princi-
pally used for drying corn and malt for the mills, for which
it seems peculiarly well qualified, as the grain, dried by it,
does not receive the smallest: tinge, but is rather fairer after
the operation than before it.  But the most valuable, as well
as singular property of this coal, is, that grain or malt dried
by it, is proof against the depredations of the weevil, and all
other small vermin.  And it is even said to be ascertained,
by repeated experiments, that if only a part of the grain be
dried with this coal, and mixed with other grain, the vermin
among the grain not dried with it will be destroyed:-So
powerful are its effects in destroying those pernicious animals,
without communicating any quality to the corn, in the small-

dealers.  When there is a great demand, it is shipped at Tor-

Halkett of Pitsirran, and has the same qualities with that of
Merrylees, as the two collieries are situated very near each
other, and are separated only by a small rivulet, which forms
the march, or boundary between the two estates.  This coal
is at present (May 1791) wrought to a considerable extent,
and is delivered at Torry pier, and put on ship-board, car-
riage free, at 30 s. per chaldron.  Notwithstanding the great
abundance of coals, there are no coal waggons in the parish.

   Roads.-The situation of this parish is upon the whole ad-
vantageous; but the inhabitants labour under one great in-
