of the Glasnock. It is built of a beautiful white freestone, from
a quarry on the banks of the Lugar.
   Parochial Registers.--The register of baptisms begins in 1704.
There are blanks in it from 1706 to 1724, from 1739 to 1740,
from 1746 to 1751, and from 1752 to 1753.
   The baptisms only are recorded up to the year 1768. After this
period, the births also are, for the most part, entered along with
them. A few only of the Dissenters register their children. The
register of proclamations for marriage begins in 1758; but, up to
the year 1782, no notice is taken of the marriages. Subsequent
to this period, the date of the marriage is also entered. No regis-
ter of deaths is kept.

               <TABLE=III.--POPULATION.>
  The population of the parish has been doubled since the year
1765; while that of the town has increased threefold in the same
period. The following is a view of it at five different periods:

	The population of the whole parish in 1755 was 1336 persons.
                                               1765,    1305
                                               1792,    1632
                                               1821,    2343
                                               1831,    2763

     The population of the village in 1765, amounted to 580 persons.
                                      1831,            1600
                          landward in 1763,             725
                                      1831,            1163
   From the above statement it appears, that, in a period of sixty-six
years, the town has increased its population nearly threefold;
while the landward part of the parish has only added to its popu-
lation, during the same period, little more than a half. The reason
of this great disparity in the rate of increase between the town
and country, is owing to the introduction, into the town, within
the above period, of the manufacture of snuff-boxes, and also of
weaving.
  The number of marriages in the parish averages 23 annually;
and the births range from 90 to 100.
  The people are, in general above the middle size; and are well
formed and proportioned, in consonance with the old adage,
" Kyle for a man." The plaid is universally worn, both by men
and women, in summer as well as in winter. When tastefully put
on, it contributes very much to give elegance of form and appear-
ance, more especially to the female figure; which, perhaps, is
one reason why the Ayrshire women are so much noted for their
fine forms.
