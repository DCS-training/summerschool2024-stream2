     Statistical Account

   Antiquities.-Not far from the village of Aberdour, on
a flat on the top of a hill, there is one of those cairns or
tumuli so frequently met with in Scotland.  The farmer
on whose farm it is situated, when carrying away the stones
some years ago, discovered a stone coffin, in which were
found the skeleton of a man, the head of a spear made of
copper, with the copper nails by which it had been fixed
to the shaft, and a piece of clear substance, like amber,
supposed to have been an amulet.  The coffin, with a great
part of the cairn still remain.  The tumulus has been coni-
cal, the coffin being exactly in the centre of the base, from
which, to the circumference, it measures 20 paces.  The
height cannot now be ascertained.  There have been found
in the same cairn several earthen vessels, containing hu-
man bones.  The vessels were flat, narrower at the bottom
than top, and without any covering.  The farmer digging
in the same field, in another place, found such a quantity of
human bones, that he was obliged to desist.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-It is said that there were only
three parsonages in Fife, Aberdour, Dysart, and Balin-
gry; and that there were only two nunneries in Scotland
of the order of St Francis, the one at Dundee, the other
at Aberdour; the field contiguous to the minister's garden
bears the name of the Sistelands to this day.-The people
of Aberdour are sober and industrious, are contented with
their situation, enjoy in a considerable degree the advan-
tages of society, and while in health, they are able to
maintain their families.  In sickness and in old age, many
need relief.-  Labourers receive from 8 d. to 1 s. 2 d. ac-
cording to their ability; carpenters and masons, 1 s. 6 d.
tailors, 6 d. and their victuals; the wages of men servants
employed in husbandry, are from L.5 to L.8 a year, with
victuals, of women servants from L. 2 to L. 3, with vic-
