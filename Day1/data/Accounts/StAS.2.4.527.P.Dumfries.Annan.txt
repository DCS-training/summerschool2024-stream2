	Character of the People.--The inhabitants of this burgh and pa-
rish are an active, enterprising, and intelligent class of people.
The great increase of the population, which has more than doub-
led within the present century, is a striking proof of their exertions
in promoting the trade, manufactures, and rural economy of this
portion of the south of Scotland, and the spirit of improvement
is now as active, or more so than ever, since the introduction of
steam navigation betwixt this port and Liverpool. Building is still
going forward with great animation, and is aided bythe abun-
dant supply of materials in the immediate vicinity, or by wa-
ter communication. The modern mansion-houses of the resident
gentry, as well as the farm-houses, are now built in a more ele-
gant and commodious form; and the policies or pleasure grounds
are equally tasteful and ornamental. Many charming villas or cot-
tages are scattered around the burgh, which are much admired for
their elegance and neatness, and the fine prospects which they
command. Speculation here, as in many other places, may in a
few instances have been pushed too far, or in advance of even the
present rapid rate of improvements; but where this has occasionally
appeared, the consequences may prove a warning, against the like
imprudence. From the keenness of competition displayed in this
burgh, there are certainly at present too many candidates for pub-
lic favour in the market, and, as. it is observed in other market-,
where the supply exceeds the demand, the profits must be redu-
ced to the minimum value, or the stockholder sell with a loss.
These things will no doubt rectify themselves in the end.
