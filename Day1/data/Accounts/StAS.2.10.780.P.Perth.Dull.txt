             There is no society established in the parish for religious pur-
           poses, but collections are almost annually made for the General
           Assembly's Schemes, and other religious and charitable objects,
           which may average about L.30.
             The following table exhibits the number of families, communi-
           cants, Dissenters of all denominations, and pnpulation, in the re-
           spective districts allocated to the different places of worship in
           connection with the Established Church within the quoad civilia
           parish :

           Education.-There are at present nine schools in operation
         within the territorial boundaries of the parish, viz. the parochial
         school at Dull; four schools supported by the Society for Propa-
         gating Christian Knowledge, wherenf one is stationed at Aber-
         feldy, Amulree, Grandtully, and Foss, respectively; together with
         four schools taught by young men entirely on their own adventure;
         and the aggregate average attendance at these schools is about
         600. The parochial schoolmaster has the maximum salary of
         L.34, 4s. 4 1/2d.; his yearly receipt of school-fees may average
         L.18 ; and his other emoluments, as precentor and clerk to the
         heritors and kirk-session, may probably amount to L. 15, making
         an annual income of about L.67. He has besides the legal ac-
         commodation of house and garden; but both dwelling-house and
         school-room are at present in a most wretched state of repair, and
         alike uncomfortable and incommodious.
           Libraries.-There are two libraries in the parish. The one is
         a subscription, and the other a circulating library. The former
         was established many years ago, and is denominated " The Aber-
         feldy Evangelical Library." Most of the books, consisting of
         nearly 400 volumes, are of a religious and moral character. The
         latter wasonly instituted about three years ago by Mr Cameron,
         bookseller at Aberfeldy. It contains about 250 volumes, consist-
         ing principally of fictitious works, travels, and voyages.
