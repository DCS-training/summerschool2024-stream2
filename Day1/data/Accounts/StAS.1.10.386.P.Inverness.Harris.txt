was once remarkable for instances of longevity.  Martin, in
his account of the Western Isles, says, he knew severals in
Harris of 90 years of age, as was attested by the minister and
elders.  The lady Macleod, he adds, who past the most of
her time here, lived to 103, had then a comely head of hair

year 1779 to 1785, the average number of deaths, of adult

   Language.-Gaelic is universally spoken here; and excepting
the number already specified, who have been taught to read
and write English, few can speak any other language.  It is
almost obvious to common reflection, that the inhabitants of
these islands, formerly cut off, both by their local and poli-

and Saxon nations, and having as yet but little intercourse
with strangers, must have retained this dialect of the ancient
Celtic in its greatest purity.  It has not been adulterated in
the least degree by the Danish conquerors; excepting the
names of places, we scarcely find a word resembling any of
the Norvegian dialects in the Gaelic of the Hebrides.  All of
those barbarous invaders who settled in the country, soon
adopted the language and manners of the conquered, one
