   Quarries-There is whin stone in different parts, and
good free stone quarries upon the banks of Whittater, both
very fit for building houses, and inclosing ground.

   Minerals.-A copper mine was discovered in Lord Dou-

The bulls are let out to the country at two guineas.  Sheep
is the great staple of the low parts of this parish, and of this
