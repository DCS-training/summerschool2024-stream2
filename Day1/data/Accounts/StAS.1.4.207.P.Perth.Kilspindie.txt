of inclosures.  However, the farmers are all convinced of
the great utility of inclosures, and would universally prefer
an inclosed and subdivided farm, to one wholly open.

   Stipend and Poor.-The average value of the living here
is about L. 77 Sterling.  The glebe lies detached in seve-
ral different places, and some part of it is a rugged bank;
but there are 6 or 7 acres of it of a tolerably good soil,
that might give L. 1, 15 s. or L. 2 the acre.-There are on-
ly 2 old men, without wife or children, who are wholly
supported by the parish, though 9 other poor families re-
ceive occasional relief, for which the collections at the
church have hitherto been sufficient.

   Prices, Wages, etc.-Beef generally sells at 4 d. the pound,
veal 5 d. mutton 3 d. fowls 1 s. and 1 s. 2 d. butter 9 d.
wheat L. 1, 1 s. barley 14 s. oat-meal 14 s. the boll.  Day's
wages are 1 s. generally; but 1 s. 3 d. and 1 s. 6 d. in har-
vest, without diet.  When they receive their diet, the wages
are from 8 d. to 1 s.  Fuel is whins, broom, and coals from
the frith of Forth, at the rate of 3 s. 9 d. or 4 s. the boll,
weighing 52 Dutch stones, besides carriage from the har-
bour.  Servants wages in this country have risen to a most
alarming height.  The men from L. 7 to L. 15, 15 s. a-year,
with 2 pecks of meal a-week, and 9 d. a-week for milk or
beer; women from L. 2 to L. 3, with their victuals.  The
men-servants, with all their enormous fees, are disobliging,
perverse and obstinate, refusing to work more than 6 hours
in the forenoon, and 4 in the afternoon.  They have no
idea of submitting to any little economical employment at
a winter fire-side.  Bid them mend a corn-sack, and they
will fly in your face.
