     Statiscal Account

the year 1172, Glasgow was erected by William, firnamed the
Lyon, into a royal burgh, in favour of St Kentigern, and
Joceline, bishop of Glasgow, which was confirmed and ex-
tended by Subsequent kings.  In 1450, King James the II.
erected the city and barony of Glasgow into a regality, in
favour of the bishop, who, the more effectually to secure
the obedience of his vassals, tenants, and other inhabitants
of the barony, appointed powerul nobles, bailies of the
regality.  This office was long in the family of the Dukes
of Lennox, who, in 1621, acquired from the bishop an ab-
solute grant of the office.  The Duke of Lennox at length
resigned it to the Crown, who, after the Revolution, until
1748, appointed bailies of the regality.  And as this right
was not abolished by the jurisdiction act, it is supposed to
be still competent to the Crown to revive that office.
   In 1611, King James VI. granted the city a very ample
charter, by which he erected it into a burgh royal, to be
holden under his Majesty in free burgage.  In 1636, King
Charles I. granted a charter to the city, to be holden of his
Majesty, cointaining very ample powers and privileges, and
confirming its power of electing a bailie on the river Clyde,
whose district extends, from the bridge to the Cloch, in
which he exercises a maritime, civil, and criminal jurisdic-
tion.  This charter was afterwards ratified by act of Parlia-
ment, in 1661;  and, after the Revolution, all former charters,
and acts of Parliament in the city's favour, were confirmed
by an act in 1690.
   Although, from the period, in which Glasgow was first
erected into a royal burgh, it held its commercial and poli-
tical privileges by successive grants from the Crown; yet,
as these grants were in favour of the bishop, he, afterwards
the archbishop, and then the Lord of regality, (who, upon
the abolition of Episcopacy, came in place of the archbi-
shop), had the privilege of electing the Magistracy.  In
