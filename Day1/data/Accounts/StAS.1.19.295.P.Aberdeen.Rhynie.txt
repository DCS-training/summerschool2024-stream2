   Disadvantages.-These are, the distance from market,
want of capital in many of the farmers, and, in some cases,
mill-multures; but these last are all, by the Duke of Gor-
don, to be abolished, when the present-leases expire; and
the carrying up a canal from Aberdeen to the head of the
Garioch, or from Huntly to Rhynie, will in time render
the markets more accessible.

   Character of the People.-They are sober, industrious,
peaceable, and contented with their condition.  They en-
joy not the luxuries of cities, but they have the necessaries
and some of the comforts of life, along with health of body
and animation of character; and they add more to the
strength of the country than four times their number of
discontented and debauched manufacturers, or mobbish po-
liticians can do, in any time of public or national danger.
