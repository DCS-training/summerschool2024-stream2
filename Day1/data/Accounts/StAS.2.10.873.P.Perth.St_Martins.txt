                   UNITED PARISHES OF

               ST MARTINS AND CAMBUSMICHAEL.

       PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING.

            THE REV. WILLIAM RITCHIE, MINISTER.


            I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

   Name, Extent, &c.-These two parishes were united about 150
years ago, and took their names from the saints to whom they
were dedicated. The united parish extends from the banks of the
Tay about 5 miles to the east, forming an oblong square, averaging
nearly two miles in breadth. The soil in general is a black
mould, with a till bottom, and seems originally to have been taken
from moor, but is now mostly all cultivated. Limestone is also
found, though not used to any great extent.

                     II.-CIVIL HISTORY.

   Parochial Registers.-The registers comunence in 1712. Till
about 1820, matters of church discipline, cash transactions, births,
and marriages were all huddled into one book; but since that pe-
riod, there has been a distinct and accurate register of each kept.
   Land-owners, with their respective valuations in Scots money.-

Antiquities.-Under this head fall to be noticed the remains of
