   Population.-The number of inhabitants in these parishes,
those of the village of Scallouray included, amounts to 1794.
The average of births, for these last five years has been 45,
and that of marriages 14, annually.  The average of deaths
cannot be ascertained with precision, as it has not been cus-
tomary to registrate them.

   Fisheries, etc.-Many of the inhabitants are employed in the
ling fishing; though few of them can be said to follow this
employment with advantage to themselves.  Their local si-
tuation seems to forbid their prosecuting this business.  They
carry it on from stations 10, 20, and 30 miles distant from
their own houses.  Thus they are from home during the
summer months; and all they can earn by it, is but a poor
compensation for what their farms, their flocks, and their fa-
milies must suffer by their absence.
   The women, when not busied about farm work, are em-
ployed in knitting coarse stockings.  This has of late become
an object worthy their attention.  Formerly the stockings of
Shetland were sent to Holland and Hamburgh; but the differ-
ence of their value since they found their way to other markets,
particularly the English, is said to be nearly equal to the land
