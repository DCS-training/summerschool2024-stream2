      Cotton weavers, by a late census,   .     .      .     462

   These proportions, founded on a preceding census, would re-
quire at the present date, now that cotton-weaving and coal work-
ing have much increased, and that great changes have taken and
are taking place, to be much modified, as will be shown by the
approaching census of 1841.
   The parish contains upwards of 11 square miles, 5725 Scots
acres, or about 7219 acres, imperial measure. The land, with the
exception of a small patch or two of moss, is all either regularly
or occasionally cultivatdd.  Agriculture in its present improved
state is of comparatively recent date in this part of Lanarkshire.
So late as the year 1769, the absurd and ruinous system of croft
and outfield continued to prevail.  The croft was dunged every
third or fourth year; the field land was alternately cropped and
rested, without being either fallowed or manured.  This practice
had been followed from time immemorial.  The proportion of field
to croft land was, in most farms, as three, four, and sometimes five
to one; Machan Muir was mostly of this worst description of soil,
and hence a proverbial saying in the parish and neighbourhood,
		" He that's rich and wants to be puir,
		Let him tak' a mailin' in Machan Muir."
