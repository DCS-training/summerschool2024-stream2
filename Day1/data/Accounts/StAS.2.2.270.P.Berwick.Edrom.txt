been lost. The only account which I have heard of them is, that
they were accidentally burned a long time ago. The register of
baptisms commences in 1720; register of marriages, in 1783. In
the register of burials, there are only a few entries. In all of the
registers, there are mutilations till 1801,-from which period the re-
gister of births and baptisms has been regularly kept. This re-
gister, however, is far from being complete in regard to births.
Land-owners.-There are nine landed proprietors. George Lo-
gan, Esq. of Edrom; John Carnegie, Esq. of New Edrom; Co-
lonel Home of Broomhouse; George Buchan, Esq. of Kelloe;
Alexander Dudgeon, Esq. of St Helens; Miss Boswall of Black-
adder; James Bonar, Esq. of Kimmerghame; Lord Sinclair of
Nisbet; Major Mackay of Bighouse, formerly called East Nisbet,
and afterwards Allanbank.

A considerable number of houses at Allanton, with gardens at-
tached, are faus granted by the proprietor of Allanbank a consi-
derable time ago. In ancient times, there were castles at Nisbet,
Blackadder, and Broomhouse. Upon the property of Kelloe there
is a square of cottages called Kelloe Bastle,-which was the site
of the bastell, or keep, in ancient times. There were several build-
ings of this kind in this district.
   Mansion Houses.-The mansion house on the estate of Broom.-
house was built by the present proprietor, Colonel Home, in 1813,
on the site of the ancient castle. Several skeletons were found in
digging the foundation: and a stone coffin, with an entire skeleton,
was discovered several years ago, in a field adjoining to that which
contains the grave of Sir Anthony de la Beaute.-The mansion
house of Nisbet is a fine old building, likewise in the castellated
form.-Kimmergharne House is old, but its situation on the banks
of the Blackadder is beautiful. On these banks are also situated
the mansions of Kelloe, and Bighouse, and Blackadder House. At
Blackadder House there is a conservatory in the form of a Gothic
