with premiums to the most deserving.  Manufactures must 
be established for the benefit of such as have no lands to en- 
gage their attention, and villages must be erected for the 
benefit of those who may discover a spirit for commerce, 
and where those who, by the severity of their masters, may 
be driven from the plough, may find an asylum, and be- 
take themselves to other occupations; but this is not to be 
left wholly to the proprietors.  The community at large 
are interested, and may reap some benefit from the im-

Highlands have so long been neglected by Government, and 
that while they lay ouy so much of the public money in 
settling distant colonies, a channel should be left open, 
whereby a considerable part of the mother country may be 
drained of its valuable inhabitants; bu this cannot long be 
the case; it is to be hoped, that the time is approaching when 
a relaxation from war, and other objects of importance, will 
afford them leisure to direct their attention to these remote 
corners.  Then means will be made use of that will be 
adequate to an object of such magnituted as the improve- 
ment of the Highlands.  Towns and villages will rise in 
different places, where nature has furnished the most ad-
vantageous situations; lands, that are now barren, will, in
