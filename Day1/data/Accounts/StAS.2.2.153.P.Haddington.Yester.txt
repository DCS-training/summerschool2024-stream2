	I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE ancient name of the parish was St Bothans or St
Bathans,-the name of a saint who, if we may judge by the vestiges
of him which still remain in various parts of the country, * was
once held in high and general estimation.  The change of the
name from St Bathans to Yester, seems to have been made soon
after the Reformation, which, among many other good results, has

<FOOTNOTE>Abbey St Bathans, and several villages in Ireland.
