   Prospect of Relief.-It has, however, been long a prevail-

HANNAH, contain a complete remedy against all those evils

and marshy places being thereby laid dry and fertilized; and the
brush-wood, and other combustible materials cleared from the

longing to Lord M'CARTNEY?  And how beneficial might it
prove in saving men's lives and properties, by rendering it
