     NUMBER VII

     PARISH OF WESTRUTHER

     (Country of Berwick.-Presbytery of Lauder.-Synod of
     Merse and Teviotdale.)

     By the Reverend Mr. WILLIAM SHIELS

     Origin of the Name.

   THE village from which this parish takes its name was
formerly called Wolfstruther.  This name, according
to tradition, originated from the number of wolves with
which the neighbouring grounds abounded.
   Westruther was formerly a part of the parish of Gordon.
It was first erected into a separate parish about the middle of
the last century.  Upon the application of the heritors, who
complained of the distance of the church of Gordon, a mi-
nister was appointed in the year 1647 to a chapel at Baffan-
dean, in the south side of the present parish.  About two
years after, for the better accomodation of the north parts
of the parish, a church was built at the village of Westruther,
where it still continues.  This chapel belonged to the num-
nery of Coldstream.  The walls of it still remain, to the
height of 12 or 14 feet, and inclose the burying-ground of
the Homes of Baffandean.

   Extent and Situation.-This parish is about five miles long,
and four miles broad.  It lies on the south side of that range
