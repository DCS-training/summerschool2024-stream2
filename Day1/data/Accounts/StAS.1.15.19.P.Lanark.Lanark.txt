pril to the second week of May, and barley from the
first to the end of May.  In common seasons, harvest
begins about the first of September, and ends about the
middle of October.  Even in the year 1782, there was
little or none to cut down after the first of November,
and the crop for the most part was got in.  Harvest 1792
was almost equally late, and the crop as unproductive.
The great rams prevented the corns from ripening, oc-

the grain did not fill; and it was no uncommon thing to
send two bolls of oats to the mill, and get only one boll
of meal in return, although in ordinary seasons and in
ordinary land we have generally boll for boll.*

   Climate and Diseases.  This parish, from its high, dry,
and airy situation, is perhaps as healthy a one as in Scot-
land.  Being situated in the centre of the island, it is
equally free from the Eastern fogs and the violence of the
Western rains, so that the air is always pure and clear.

of the Eastern tags, so disagreeable in the neighbourhood
of that city.  Spring droughts frequently retard the crops
very considerably, and sometimes spring frosts.  Hea-
vy rains in July and August, which are pretty common
here, have a similar effect in keeping back the harvest;
but in general the crops are earlier than in the neigh-

*All plants and vegetables common to Scotland are to be found here.
The sycamore, vulgo the plane tree, seems later to be indigeneous, and grows
among the natural woods, as do the holly and barberry.  There are few or
no sheep kept in this parish.
