tions of this kind, particularly the first, are burdensome to
the tenant, without producing any adequate advantage to the
heritor.

   Extent, Soil, Agriculture, etc.-The parish contains
about 16,896 Scotch acres of which one third at least is co-
vered with heath.  The hills and heath ground being ridged,
appear to have been under cultivation at some former period;
at least that partial kind of it, called balk and burral, which
consisted of one ridge very much raised by the plough, and
a barren space of nearly the same extent, alternately.  A
much greater quantity of this sort of land was in tillage be-
fore, than since the years of famine in the end of last centu-
ry; when many entire farms, of a wet or late soil, were allow-
ed to lie waste and uncultivated.  Since the introduction of
lime and agricultural improvements, the above method of ma-
naging out-field land has been relinquished; and small black
oats, which was the only species of grain sown in this kind
of land, have given place to white oats.
   The current of the Doverne being less rapid below than
above the town of Turreff, the haughs and meadow ground
along its banks are more extensive and fertile.  Though the pa-
rish contains almost every description of soil, that species cal-
led a light loam is most common.  Part of the lands in the
vicinity of the town lets at 40 s. per acre.  The medium
rent of land in the country part of this parish is nearly the
same as in the neighbouring parishes, and may be known by
consulting the statistical reports of them.
   Compared with what it was 20 years ago, the state of a-
griculture is now much improved; at the same time, the
want of inclosures, the prevailing practice of keeping too
great a proportion of land under crop, and the extent of bar-
ren ground, show that much remains to be done.
   That improvements have not made greater progress, the
small stock of the greater part of tenants, the shortness of
