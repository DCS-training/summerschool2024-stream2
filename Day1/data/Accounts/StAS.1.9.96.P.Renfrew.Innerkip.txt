remainder arable.  But as no measurement has been taken,
how many acres are of each, cannot be conjectured.  From
the appearance of the country, it may be supposed that
more land was in tillage 50 years ago than at present.
Most part of the arable, and a great part of the low pasture
lands, are inclosed with good stone sences, which the pro-
prietor erects, on the tenant paying 7 1/2 per cent. for out-
laid money, and on condition he leaves them sencible at
the end of his lease.  Agriculture here has made but slow
progress, and still the improvement of land is little attended
to; perhaps for the following reasons: The soil, which is
light will hardly bear the labour requisite to clear it of
weeds; and when put into a state, from which a good crop
might be expected, it is easily hurt by the severity of dry
or wet weather.  Allowing the crop to answer the expec-
tation of the farmer, the price it brings, is seldom a suffi-
cient compensation for expense and labour; this is owing
to the immense quantity of grain imported into Greenock,
and from which port it is circulated through the country,
to a great distance, whereby it is kept lower than in most
inland places Another thing which impedes agriculture,
is, the farmer pays his rent much easier from his dairy
than his plough; and for his encouragement, he finds a
ready market, and good prices for all kinds of produce,
grain excepted, in the town above mentioned.  In order to
favour this mode of farming, great part of the land is
thrown into grass; so much only is ploughed, as is barely
sufficient to support the cattle through winter.  The me-
thod of working land in general, is to rest it 3 or 4 years,
and plough it 2; seldom doing any more to it, than what
their cattle and manure do.  The dung of the cattle is used
in raising barley and potatoes which are excellent in quali-
ty, and frequently considerable in quantity; besides those
