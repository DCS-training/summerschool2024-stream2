up with its many inconveniences than to emigrate.  The 
island has excellent and extensive pasturage for sheep and
cattle.  Some of the inhabitants are very expert in catch-
ing wild fowls in the rocks, for the sake of their feathers,
which are sold at a considerable price.  This induces them
to go to places almost inaccessible; and by which attempts
some have lost their lives.

   Soil, Climate, Diseases.-Throughout the whole ministry,
the soil is rather thin and sharp; and, being mostly cultiva-
ted with the spade, makes in general, very good returns.
In the inland prts of the parishes a deep mofs prevails, and
a short heath, affording pasturage for sheep and horses, of
which the latter go wild.  The ground, towards the sea, is
hard and verdant, and hither the sheep repair in the incle-
mency of winter, as the banks are not so deeply covered
with snow as in the interior of the country; and they a-
bound with sea-wreck, which, in a severe storm, proves an
agreeable morsel to the sheep.-This place, from its being
much environed by the sea, possesses a moist air, which very
soon corrodes iron; but, being impregnated considerably
with saline particles, is not unhealthy.  Here there are no
complaints of the ague, which is not the case in districts a-
bounding with sens and bogs, at a distance from the sea.
Fogs are frequent in the months of July and August, but
have no malignant influence.-The diseases most prevalent
are rheumatisms and fevers, supposed to originate chiefly
from heats and colds.  Consumptions frequently occur, and
are believed to arise from the same cause.  Some of these,
and other diseases, may perhaps be more malignant, owing
to the difficulty and expence of procuring medical aid.  Fe-
vers, thereby, are more inveterate, and are very contagious.
In the island of Papa leprosy was very frequent in former
times; and so alarming was it, that collections were made
