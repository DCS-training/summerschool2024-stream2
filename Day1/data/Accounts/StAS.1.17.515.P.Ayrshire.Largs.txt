   The greater number of the inhabitants are of the Esta-
blished Church.  About 50 families are Burghers; and, to
the honour of both parties, they live together in mutual
amity, without exhibiting, in almost any instance, the small-
est alienation of affection on account of different religious
sentiments.

   Antiquities.-There are several castles, and houses of con-
siderable antiquity, in the parish.  Skelmurly castle was built
in 1502, and had a new addition in 1636.
   The old castle of Knock was built above 300 years ago.
It was the property of an ancient family, of the name of
Fraser, descended from John Fraser, third son of Hugh Fra-
ser of Lovat, and his wife Isabel, daughter to Sir David
Weems of Weems.  They had a grant of these lands from
King Robert III. in 1402.  It is now in ruins, and belongs
to Mr Brisbane of Brisbane.
   The castle of Fairley, formerly possessed by the ancient
family of Fairley, said to be descended from a natural son of
King Robert II. is now also in ruins.  It was built in 1521,
and is now the property of the Earl of Glasgow.  The old
part of Kilburn-house was built in 1581.
   In Brisbane-house is an old chair, made of oak, dated
1357.  The arms of the family are carved on the back,
which are,
   Sable, a cheveron, cheque or and gules between three
cushions of the second, with the initials of J. B. and E. H.
This chair, being still in excellent preservation, may serve for
many centuries to show the name and family of Brisbane to
succeeding generations.
   There are two moats, or mounds of earth, at each end of
the village of Largs, of that kind called Law-hills, at the
distance of four miles up the water of Nodesdale, at a place
called Tourgill.
