     PARISH OF NEWTON UPON AYR.

     (COUNTY OF AYR.)

     By the Rev. MR. PEEBLES.

     Origin of the Name.

   IN the charters granted to this burgh, Newton, is called
Nova villa de, or more commonly Super Air.  It is now
generally known, by the name of Newton upon Ayr.  It evi-
dently derives that appellation, from its vicinity to the adjacent
royal borough.  Though built at a later period, it appears, that
Newton originally possessed, as it still does, distinct and inde-
pendent privileges, and hence it is called, not the Newton of
Ayr, but Newton upon the banks of the river of that name.

   Situation and Extent.-Newton lies in the county, presby-
tery, and synod of Ayr.  It was at first included in the parish
of Prestick, but was erected into a separate parish in 1779.  Its
extent is very inconsiderable, not above a mile and a half in
length, and a mile in breadth.  It is bounded by the parishes
of Prestick and St Quivox, and, in every other quarter by the
river Ayr,and the sea.

   The Burgh.-Newton is a burgh of barony, or regality,
