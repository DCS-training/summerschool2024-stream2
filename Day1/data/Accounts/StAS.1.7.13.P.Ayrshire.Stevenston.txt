such a pit would command* 37 feet of good coal, which is
said to be more than they raise from the same depth at ei-
ther of these places.  And along with the goal they could
raise, with little expence, a vein of iron-stone, lying
upon the roof of the seventh seam of coal.  But this is
an enterprise which must be left to future generations.  At
present, the dip engine-pit, reaches only 54 fathoms, and
takes in only five of the seams, viz. from the pavement of
the first:  And though the engine on that pit has a cylinder
5 feet in diameter, and a 16 inch working barrel, yet they
were justly afraid that it would not be able to manage the
prodigious weight of water; so that they have lately erected
on the rise-pit (40 fathoms deep), a second steam-engine, with
a 4 1/2 feet cylinder, and a 13 1/2 inch working barrel, which it
is to be hoped will do their business effectually; and they
have at present a field of coal on the level and rise, which
will probably serve them for a generation or two.

   Subterraneous Divisions of the Coal Fields.-1.  This very ex-
tensive field of coal, reaching from Saltcoats to Garnock, is
cut into three parts, by two great galls or dikes that run
through the whole field, nearly in a line from north to
south.  The first western division next Saltcoats was
wrought improperly in the 1719; and the greatest part of
it remains, very much incommoded with water, open to fu-
ture adventurers.  It is bounded on the east by the Capon-
craig Gall, a great dike of hard whin-stone, above 20 yards
thick, at least where it appears at the surface, sinking per-
pendicularly into the earth to an unknown depth, This

<FOOTNOTE>

*In the eastern part of the field, there are two thin seams,
besides those exhibited, lying between the 9th and 10th, one of
3 feet, and another of a feet 4 inches, which would make the
thickness of the whole coal raised there 42 feet 4 inches.
