   Schools.-There is a parochial school, to which belongs
the usual trifling salary of 100 merks.  The perquisites of the
schoolmaster, as session clerk, are poorly paid, particularly
since the commencement of that odious and unproductive
tax imposed on baptisms, etc.  The consequence is, that
few childrens names are registered.  Till the people be
relieved of this tax, and till even some plan be de-
vised to compel a regular registration of every bap-
tism, marriage, and burial, no exact statistical account
of any parish from a public register can ever be ob-
tained; no comparison can ever be made of the state of a
parish at different periods, with sufficient accuracy.  There
are great charms in the registers of this parish.  It might
have a good effect, were the registers of every parish regu-
larly called for and examined by the presbytery annualy.
The baptism-tax, etc. is not only unpopular, but hurtful to
a useful class of men, the schoolmasters, who are usually
the session-clerks.  Many, to secure the small trifle of dues
that remain, agree to pay the tax themselves; so that, in
those instances, the clerk loses more than the Revenue
gains.  The number of the scholars at the parish school is
about 20 in summer, and upwards of 30 in winter.  The
school-fees are as low as in any parish.  The teacher can-
not make above L. 10 a-year.  Shall we hope that the pe-
riod is not far distant when this uselful body of men will be
befriended by Government, and sufficient salaries appoint-
ed for them?  Dr Ramsay, above mentioned, mortified al-
so L. 500 for the support of a free school in the east end of
this parish.  There is a good school-house, but no fund for
its support.  There is a glebe of about 6 acres.  The place
is in the gift of Sir Alexander Ramsay, Bart. patron of all
