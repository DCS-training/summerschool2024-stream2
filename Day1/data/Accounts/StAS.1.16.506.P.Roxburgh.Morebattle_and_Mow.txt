their horses and carts, in agricultural operations; frequently
in carrying lime and coals to the farmers in the vicinity;

and cows.  Some of the villagers are day-labourers, whilst
others are occupied at their several trades and handicrafts, in

society should every where be so formed, that people in the
lower stations of life may have a foundation on which to
build their hopes of advancing their circumstances by fru-
