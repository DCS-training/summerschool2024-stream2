     Statistical Account

Bervy and Forthy forming this line of division, for the most
part about three miles in length; and on the north east side it
is bounded by the parishes in Glenberry and Kinness, about six
miles in length, back to the river Berry, where the southern
boundary commenced, forming a sharp angle neat the mouth
of that river.

   Surface.-The surface is unequal, presenting particularly
two rising grounds or ridges, with hollows or valleys betwixt
them, and the boundaries of the parish on each side, where
the ground again rises to still greater height.  The one of
these ridges commences at the eastern angle, running west-
ward about two miles, where the other begins a little ob-
liquely upon the one side toward the Bervy river, forming a
wide hollow betwixt it and the northern boundary, which
reaches to the western boundary, and joins the hollow of the
Mearns.  The narrow valley in which Bervy river runs, is
highly picturesque and beautiful, containing the mansions of
Arbuthnot and Allardyce, with the church situated between
them.

   Soil.-The soil is various.  Along the southern valley it
is strong clay; upon the rising grounds above mentioned it
is light land; and in the bottom of the northern valley it is
wet and swampy, being mostly in rough pasture; but the
fields toward the northern boundary, where the ground again
rises, are more dry, and of a lighter soil.
   The air, in general, is moist, owing to the nature and po-
sition of the surface, its natural wetness and exhalations from
the streams with which it is watered; yet it has never been
observed to be particularly unfavourable to health; and the
inhabitants, in general, are of good size, and many of them
live to a great age.
