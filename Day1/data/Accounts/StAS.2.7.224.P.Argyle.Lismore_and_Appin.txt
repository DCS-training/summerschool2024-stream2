Onieh, on the north towards Fort-William; and, accordingly, al-
though the inhabitants of Glencoe and Onieh respectively belong
now to diiterent parishes, as we shall see presently, still they bury
their dead in the burying-ground of their original parish at Elean-
munde.  There the ashes of their fathers rest, and there they
bury their children.  It is well known, that, during the dark ages
of the church, particularly between the years 900 and 1200, there
were many parishes united, through the influence of selfish parties,
who sought to diminish the number of the clergy, and to apply to
their own purposes the patrimony of the suppressed parishes; and
it was probably about that period, that the parish of Eleanmunde
was dismembered, and Mamore and Onieh attached to Kilmaly,
and Glencoe, &c. attached to Appin, which, in its turn, was joined
to Kilmaluag, or Lismore.  The modern style of the church of
Saint Munde would seem to nullify this supposition, but the diffi-
culty is in a great measure removed by the fact, that, since the
Reformation, and perhaps before it, until a missionary on the
Royal Bounty establishment was placed in Glencoe and Glene-
tive, the minister of Lismore was obliged to officiate four times a
year in Glencoe, and it is likely enough, that the people would
on these occasions resort to their former place of worship to hear
Divine service, and would therefore keep the church in repair for
many years, after it ceased to be the principal place of worship
in the parish.  It is not improbable, that, after the Reforma-
tion, the people, who disclaimed every thing Popish, would pull
down the Popish church of St Munde, and build on its ruins the
plain fabrick whose remains are now to be seen, there to meet
their minister, when he visited them once a quarter.  It may be ob-
served this place, that the Island of St Munde is the joint pro-
perty of Sir Duncan Cameron of Fassfern and Callard, on the
north side of Lochleven, and of Mr M'Donald of Glencoe on the
south side, and that these gentlemen have, within the last few
years, with very proper spirit, planted it,-which, in a few years
hence, will give it an interesting and romantic appearance, and
will add greatly to the beauty of the surrounding scenery.
   Name.-Lismore signifies a great garden, being a compound
of the two Gaelic terms, Lios, a garden, and Mor, great, pro-
bably from the exceeding richness of its soil, and its being situ-
ated, like a garden in a desert, in the centre of a country much
less fertile than itself, and which it supplies in a great measure
with the necessary commodities, of life.  The term Appin is of
