and Improvements have given some encouragement for the
erecting of lint-mills in this neighbourhood, and these pro-

   Rent.-In the neighbourhood of the town, land let so high
as 50 s. and some of the fields close to the town at 3 l. an
acre.  These are farmed by horse-hirers, who lay them down
in grass; and, by the high wages they get for letting out
their horses, are enabled to pay this enormous price for the
land.

ground, commanding a view of Forres and Findhorn, and
the Moray Frith, stands the house of Burdsyards) reckoned

There are likewise considerable plantations of firs upon the
estate of Cuthail, belonging to Alexander Penrose Cunning
of Altyre, situated to the south-west of the town, about 3
miles upon the road leading from Forres to Yverttown.
