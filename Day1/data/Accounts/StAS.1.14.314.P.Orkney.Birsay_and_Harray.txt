ing grassy.  There are 2 or 3 fine burns, one of which
washes the middle of the barony, all full of fine trout;
and sometimes, through the barony burn, a salmon, by
chance, may run up, but always at an unseasonable time
of the year.  The extent of the sea coast is about 10 miles;
the shore all rocky, except two little spots, which are
stony, where our fishing boats come in.  The fish catch-
ed in our parish, are a few poor cod, a few thin ling, a
few haddocks new and then, a hallibut now and then;
and, in general, we have plenty of dog fish, caught up-
on hand lines, which all our fish are caught upon, being
the custom of the parish.  These dog fish are sold to the
neighbouring parishes at about an average price of 6 d.
the dozen:  the oil sold, for these few years past, at
an average of 10 d. the pint, or thereabout.  The dog
fish are best in June, July, and August, when they
have their livers in prime; when that time passes, they
go to the northward.  There are numbers of small fish,
such as coal fish, and all their fry, of different ages,
down to a year old; at which time, I have seen them
sold at the rate of 6 d. the thousand, at the same time
that worse fish of the same kind was sold in Edinburgh
market at 6 d. the dozen, or thereabout, under the name
of podlies; ours are called sillicks*.  Many other fish
are caught about this coast, but in general in inconsi-
derable quantities, called in this country milds, bergills,
skate, fish and frog, and many other species that seldom
are caught upon lines.  Two of the best kinds of fish we
have are the tusk and the stein-biter, but these are sel-
dom caught.  Numbers of whales of different kinds
hover about the coast, but none are caught.  A few of
