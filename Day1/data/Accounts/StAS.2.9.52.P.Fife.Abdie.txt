old castle, said to have belonged to Duncan Macduff, first Thane
or Earl of Fife,-which is rendered extremely probable, by the
circumstance, that the pedestal of his cross, the badge of the
family, is still to be seen about a mile to the westward.  Sir
James Balfour, in his Annals, speaks of a battle that was fought,
between the Scots under Walface and the English, in June anno
1300, near the Castle of Lindores, in which 3000 of the latter
were killed and 500 taken prisoners. This castle of Lindores is
also mentioned in the history of Wallace, as the place to which
that hero and his companions retired after the battle.
    Mansion-Houses.-There are four of these lately built; but only
two of the heritors reside. The most remarkable of these mansions
is the house of Inchrye, which cost L. 12,000. It is in the Gothic
style of architecture, with a verandah in front, and adorned with tur-
rets and battlements. From various points this most romantic build-
ing is seen to great advantage, but especially from the high road
that leads from Trafalgar inn to Newburgh. There it presents
itself to the view of the delighted traveller, with its lawns and mea-
dows, and woods fringing the lake. Proceeding westward, another
picturesque object appears, the House of Lindores, the residence
of Admiral Maitland, situated upon an eminence; and farther on,
the new church, with its pillared belfry overlooking the waters.
This is, on the whole, a delightful scene, and, were the plantations
a little more advanced, might vie in beauty with places of greater
celebrity.
