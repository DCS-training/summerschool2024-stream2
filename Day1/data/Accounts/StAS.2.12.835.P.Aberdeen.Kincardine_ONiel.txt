farm of any tolerable size. Enclosures, built wholly of stones, and
sunk fences faced with that material, are now very general. A
similar beneficial change has taken place in the improvement of
the implements of husbandry, and in the breed of horses and black-
cattle. The threshing-mills have now been generally adopted on
farms even of moderate extent.  They are furnished of a light con-
struction, on a small scale, and at an expense which the great di-
minution of labour and increased production of grain from them
will soon defray.  A very favourable and agreeable change in the
education, manners, and living of the people has also taken place
within the last forty year.  The inconvenience and hardship
which this parish suffered from the want of roads previous to 1800
was very great.  After that time, they were much improved,-and
greatly to the benefit of the agriculture of the parish.
   Extent and Produce of the Parish.-The following estimates of
the extent of the parish in imperial acres, and the annual average
produce raised in it, it is hoped, is near the truth.

Since the foregoing table was made out, I find, by plans shown
me by the proprietor, that the estate of Craigmile contains above
1200 acres arable, and above 150 have been improved within the
last three years, or are in the process of improvement. I must here
advert to a considerable discrepancy betwixt the number of arable
acres reported by my predecessor and the above.  From the best
information I have been able to procure, joined to my own obser-
vation for above thirty years, I find the return to Sir John Sinclair
should have little, if at all, exceeded 4200 acres; for certainly above
560 have been since improved.  Mr Morrice's advanced period of
life, I know, rendered him wholly dependent on the information
of others.
