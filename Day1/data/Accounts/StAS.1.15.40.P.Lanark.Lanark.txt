   A great proportion of the inhabitants are Highlanders
mostly from Caithness Inverness and Argyleshires.  Few
of those from the west understand English.  In 1791 a ves-
sel carrying emigrants from the isle of Sky to North A-
merica, was driven by stress of weather into Greenock;
about 200 were put ashore in a very destitute situation.
Mr Dale whose humanity is ever awake offered them im-
mediate employment, which the greater bulk of them ac-
cepted:  And soon after with a view to prevent far-
ther emigration to America he notified, to the people of
Argyleshire and the isles, the encouragement given to fa-
milies at the cottonmills; and undertook to provide hou-
ses for 200 families in the course of the 1792, these were
all finished last summer, (1793) and a considerable num-
ber of Highlanders have of late come to reside at New
Lanark.
   Families from any quarter possessed of a good moral
character, and having three children fit for work, above
nine years of age, are received,-supplied with a house
at a moderate rent, and the women and children provided
with work.  The children, both those fit for work
and those who are too young for it, have the privilege
of attending the school gratis, the former in the evenings
the latter through the day.  Three prosessed teachers are
paid by Mr Dale for this purpose, and also seven assi-
tants who attend in the evenings, one of whom teaches
writing.  There is also a sunday school at which all the
master's and assistants attend.
