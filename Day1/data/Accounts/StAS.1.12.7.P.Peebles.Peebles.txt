and which they justly vary as the exigencies of the times re-
quire.  As the burgh is the greatest part of the parish, the 
magistrates and council have always appointed schoolmasters

mar, another the English school, and have provided them with 
proper houses and salaries.  Private schools also have always 
existed, and of late have become rivals for same of education

have received the first principles of literature, who have be-
come ornaments to their country, and blessings to mankind. 
What a pity is it, that in a country of increased, and of year-

ty and good services.  Now, improvements begin to be car-
ried on upon a larger scale.  Of late years, about fifty houses 
have been built or thoroughly repaired.  Woollen, linen, and
