hired for the year, and maintained by the respective families
that employ them.  As the Justices of the Peace found it
impracticable to fix any standard for servants wages, it is in
vain to attempt laying any thing decidedly on this subject.
One man pays servants, both men and women, a third, and
sometimes one half, more than others, owing to the diffe-
rence both of treatment and the manner in which they are
employed.  Such as work for day's wages have from 8 d. to
1 s. a day, and maintain themselves.  At severe work, such
as help-making, wood-cutting, and coaling, etc. they have
much more.  A taylor has 6 d. or 8 d. and his victuals; and
a shoemaker much the same; carpenters, and other mecha-
nics, 1 s. or 1 s. 2 d. and their victuals.

   Services.  Although personal services performed by tenants
will prevail in different parts of the Highlands, they are be-
coming obsolete in these parishes.  The services were seldom
descretionary, but limited.  Some tenants go from this island
to the main-land to perform these services, at the distance of
8 or 9 miles.  They devote at least 6 or 7 days yearly to
their master's or landlord's service in this way; and they get
some allowance, for the most part, to support them while
performing their work.  This is over and above 2 or 3 days
that some of them work yearly at roads.  Some proprietors
in neighbouring parishes carried these services to a shameful,
not to say oppressive, pitch, in obliging their tenants and
cottagesrs to cut, stuck, and house their peats, etc, and to find
their own provisions all the time.  This is one of the innu-
merable grievances occasioned by the heavy coal duty.

   Roads and Bridges.  Since the residence of the present in-
cumbent in the parish, roads and bridges have undergone a
remarkable change for the better, esopecially in Appin.  There
