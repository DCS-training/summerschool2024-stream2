     Statistical Account

deaths, from the circumstance, that there are 3 different church.
yards in the parish, can by no means be ascertained.

   Church, School and Poor.-The living betwixt stipend and
element money is 75 L. Sterling.  There is no victual rest.
There are two glebes in the parish, which might be let, as
the value of both, at 7 L. Sterling a year.  The manse was
built 70 years ago, and has been different times repaired since.
The offices were lately rebuilt, and are in good order.  The
church is plaistered, being finished off with great taste.  The
number of begging poor exceeds 20, but these go seldom from
the bounds of this country.  Some times 30, or even 40, re-
ceive a part of the public funds.  Many of there are reduced
householders, who would starve rather than beg.  When any
person is reduced by accident, or some severe distemper, to
poverty, the method practised for their relief, is by a general
collection; and in justice to the people, it must be said, that
their liberality, on all such occasions, far exceeds what might
be expected.  There are no other funds besides the public col-
lections, which, at an average amount from 10 L. to 15 L. Ster-
ling a-year.  Much depends on the price of cattle, and the
sale of victual, which is more or less according to the season.
When the family of Grant reside at Castle Grant, which, for
some time past, has been pretty much the case, the collection
has thereby been much enlarged, as they constantly attend
public worship, in all seasons of the year.  Their beneficence
makes every one delicate in giving them trouble, as every ob-
ject of distress, within their reach, experiences their charity.

   Language.-The common people speak the Gaelic tongue,
but the English is the prevailing language, which they pro-
nounce with great propriety, and with very little of the brogue.
