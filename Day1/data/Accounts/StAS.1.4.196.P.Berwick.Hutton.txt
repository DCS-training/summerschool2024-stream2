presbytery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and

on the N. W. by Chirnside; on the N. by Foulden; and
on the N. E. by Mordington.  The general appearance of

are some rocks, but of no great height.  The soil on the
banks of the Tweed and Whittader, is deep and loamy;
but towards the middle of the parish, it is thin, on a strong
clay.  The air is sometimes moist, but generally dry, and
the people remarkably healthy.  They were formerly
