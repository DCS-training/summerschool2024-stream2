   Neither will improvement in agriculture always corres-
pond with an increase of population.  If from sterility of
soil and the high price of labour, the merchant can import
grain from foreign countries cheaper than the farmer can
raise it; or if the genius and industry of the country pur-
sue with a strong bent a tract different from agriculture,
may not the cultivation of our own fields be neglected, and
the nation be reduced to depend on other countries for its
sustenance?  This is an evil which may in time remedy it-
self.  Yet inconveniences may arise in the interval; and, it
is still an object of attention, that the general assertion, that
agriculture must always improve with the increase of popu-
lation and manufactures, is too unqualified, and ought not
always to be considered as indisputable by philosophers and
legislators.
   The average of land is about L. 1 per acre.  Grounds
in the neighbourhood of Pollock which had been for some
time in lee, have frequently been let for two years at
L. 6: 10 per acre.  The valued rent of the parish, is about
L. 3300 Scots money; the real rent, it is believed, about
L. 3400 sterling.  This is divided among five landed pro-
prietors; among whom this parish has the happiness of
numbering the two aunts of the present patron, Mrs Mont-
gomery of Auldhouse, and her sister Miss Maxwell; whose re-
fidenee diffuses blessings on their neighbourhood, and who
are the distinguished, though unaffected examples of every
virtue and of every duty.
