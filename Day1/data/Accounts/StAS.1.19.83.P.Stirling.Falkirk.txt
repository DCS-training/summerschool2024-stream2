let the land in long leases; whereas it is common to carry
on improvements after the farms are in the possession of te-

   Of Servants Wages, Prices of Food, etc.-A good plough-
man gets about L. 12 a-year, together with his bed and
board; and a common female servant expects from L. 3,
10 s. to L. 4 per annum, independent of food and lodging.
A man who engages to labour by the day, has 1 s. 2 d. in
summer, and 1 s. in winter.  During harvest the wages are
higher.  Great quantities of grain, especially barley, beans,
and pease, are sold in this market.  Carse barley is held in
such high estimation, that it brings, in general, two or three
shillings per boll more than barley from other parts of the
country.  During these several months, the price of grain
has been extravagant; barley has been sold at L 1: 12 s.
per boll, wheat at L. 2: 12: 6, and oat-meal at 1 s. 4 d.
a-peck.  It is worthy of observation, that in former
times of scarcity, the people of Scotland looked up to
England, as well as to foreign countries, for supply;
but in the present season, when the people of England are
in want, we have not only plenty within our borders, but
have been enabled to relieve them in their necessity.

   Markets, etc.-Besides several fairs in the year, and
three trysts* , there is a market every week on Thursday.
At these three trysts there are, at an average, 60,000 black
cattle.  A most of them are of the small Highland breed,
the medium price may be fixed at L. 4 each.  Thus at
these meetings, it is supposed, L. 400,000 Sterling are put
into circulation.  Not a small proportion of this money
passes through the Falkirk Bank.  There are also horses
and sheep disposed of at these markets.

*Tryst is a Scotch word for an appointed meeting.
