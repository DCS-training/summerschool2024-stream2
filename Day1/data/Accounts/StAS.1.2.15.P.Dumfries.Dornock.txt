   Rivers, Fishing, etc.-The small river, Kirtle, touches the
north east point of the parish, and the Solway Firth, or Boo-
ness Wath, as it is called, is its southern boundery*.  In the
Kirtle, there are some common trouts, eels, pike, perch and
the like; but these are not in such quantities as to be an object
of much profit to the inhabitants.  The fishings in the Solway
Firth, however, are more considerable, and merit a more par-
ticular detail, both on account of the income they produce,
and the singular modes of fishing, which are adopted; a de-
scrition of which, may furnish useful hints to proprietors in
other parts of the kingdom.  The modes are four.-1.  With
leisters:  a kind of four pronged fork, with the prongs turned
a little to one side, having a shaft 20 or 24 feet long.  There
they run along the sand on their edge, or throw them when
they see any fish.  In this manner they often wound and kill
great quantities.  Some of our people are very dexterous at
this exercise, and will sometimes upon horseback throw a
leister, and kill at a great distance.  This is also called sbowling;
as it is generally practised, when the tide is alsmost spent, and
the waters turned shallow.-2.  A second mode of fishing, called
hoaving or hauling, is standing in the stream, either at the flow-
ing or ebbing of the tide, with a pock net fixed to a kind of frame,
consisting of a beam, 12 or 14 feet long, having three small
sticks or rungs fixed into it, one in the middle, and one at each
end, about four feet long each; to these the net is fixed
