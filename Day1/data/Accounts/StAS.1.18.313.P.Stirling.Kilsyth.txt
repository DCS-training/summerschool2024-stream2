soil, in the middle of a rich strath, and it is accessible at all
times, as it is upon the old north road from Glasgow to Edin-
burgh; and what is highly favourable, it is at equal distances
from Falkirk and Glasgow on the east and west, and from
Hamilton and Stirling on the south and north.  The air is

   These advantages have induced a great many new settlers to
come among us.  And Sir Archibald Edmonstone, Bart. of
