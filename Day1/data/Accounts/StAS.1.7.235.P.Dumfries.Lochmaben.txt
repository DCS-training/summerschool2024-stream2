     of Lochmaben.

was erected into a royal borough by Robert Bruce I.  King of
Scotland, whose paternal estate was the great lordship of An-
nandale.  He gave the borough lands out of his own estate.
It has been a town of greater note formerly than now, and
has extensive borough roods and town commonty.  Much
of it is feued off, from which they have but a small feu-duty.
There may be about 700 inhabitants in the town and borough
roods.

   Linen Manufacture.-There is a considerable manufacture
carried on, in the town and country round it, of coarse linen
cloth, to the extent of 60,000 yards yearly, which is all sold
into England, mostly unbleached, at from 6 d. to 1 s. or 13 d.
per yard.

   Church.-The church is an old Gothic fabric, dedicated
to St. Magdalen.  In a bloody family feud, between the
Maxwells of Nithsdale, and the Johnstons of Annandale, it
suffered much.  In an engagement between these on a plain
called Dryfe Sands, the Maxwells, who were defeated with
great slaughter, fled, and took sanctuary in the church of
Lochmaben, and were pursued by the Johnstons, who burn-
ed the church to the ground.  This happened about the
year 1591.  There appears to have been also several small
chapels in the parish, the vestiges of which now scarcely re-
main.  The stipend is 1051.  The Viscount of Stormont is
patron.

   Castle at the Town.-There is the site of a very antient
castle close to the town, on a noble situation; between the
castle and kirk lochs, surrounded by a deep moat and sosse.
Tradition says, the stones of it were carried away to built
another castle.  It commands a pleasant prospect over an ex-
tensive plain, and was originally the seat of Robert Bruce,
