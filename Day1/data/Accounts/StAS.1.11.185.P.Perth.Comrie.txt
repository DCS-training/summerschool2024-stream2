pists, who attend the Roman Catholic chapel in the neigh-
bouring parish of Muthil, in which, as well as in Crieff,
many of them reside.

   Schools.-Besides the parochial school, at which are taught
from 70 to 100 scholars, there are 3 others, supported by the
Society for propagating Christian Knowledge; one of which
has often, during the winter season, 100; the other 2 from
50 to 60 scholars.  In the remote parts of the parish, there
are 2 or 3 small schools, supported by the tenants, whose
children derive benefit from them.

   Poor.-The number of poor on the parish roll is 12.  Some
of these receive a weekly, and some only an occasional sup-
ply.  The weekly pensioners receive 6 d. or 1 s.; the occa-
sional ones 2 s. or 3 s. three or four times in the year; and, at
Martinmas and Candlemas, even the weekly pensioners receive
2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. each.  The annual sum expended for their re-
lief is about 40 L.  This sum is produced by the collections
in the church, by proclamations, and mortcloth dues, by fines
for irregular marriages, and other trespasses, and the interest
of 100 L.  The poor are permitted to beg in the parish.  Some
poor house-keepers beg for corn in spring; and many poor
house-wives beg for wool in summer.

   Roads and Bridges.-There is one great road through the
parish, leading from Crieff to Loch-Erne head; and several
smaller roads through the glens.  Between Crieff and Loch-
Erne there are 5 stone bridges across the river Erne, 3 of
which consist of 4 arches.  There are besides several stone and
wooden bridges on the Ruchil, the Lednaig, &c.  The roads
in this and the neighbouring parishes were formerly made by
the statute labour; but this was lately converted into money.
