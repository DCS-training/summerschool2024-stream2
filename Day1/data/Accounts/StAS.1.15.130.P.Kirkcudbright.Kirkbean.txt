   Statistical Account

   Schools and Poor.-The parochial school funds amount to
1008 L. 4 s.  The interest of this rum supports two separate
free schools; the one under the direction of the heritors and
minister, 608 L. 4 s.  The other, 400 L.++  The school support-
ed by this sum, is left to the management of "5 honest, up-
"right men, of good report in the parish, appointed to lay
"out the capital upon good and sufficient security; and to
"take care of the subject; and that the school-master do his
"duty to the children under his care, by instructing them
"in the principles of the Protestant Reformed Religion, and
"to read and write well; and also good manners and good
"morals."-The parochial poor's funds amount to 265 L. be-
sides the weekly collections, which, with the interest of this
sum, support annually about 12 persons on the roll, and sup-
ply occasionally the wants of others.  There has not been a
a beggar in the parish in the memory of man.

   Population.-As there has been no regular register kept in
the parish, of baptisms, marriages, or deaths, either before or
since the late Act of Parliament, imposing certain duties up-
on each, therefore, no account of these can now be given.
The following is the present state of the population, and the
number of dissenters and mechanics in the parish.

++This last sum was a donation of the late Mr ANDREW MARSHALL,
merchant in Glasgow.  He first gave 300 l. and afterwards, at has death, left
100 L. being, as it is expressed by himself, in the deed of his first donation,
"Freely and cheerfully given, I think, for the best purposes, namely, the
"farther promoting of genuine Christian knowledge, true piety and virtue
"towards God, and uprightness towards all men."
