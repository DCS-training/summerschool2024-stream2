corpse to the church-yard for interment.  While, on these
occasions, the good folks are assembled, though they never
run into excess, yet no small expence is incurred by the fa-
mily; who often vie with those around them, in giving, as
they call it, an honourable burial to their deceased friend.
Such a custom is attended with many evils, and frequently
involves in debt, or reduces to poverty, many families other-
wise frugal and industrious, by this piece of useless parade,
and ill judged expence.
   We are however happy to add, that notwithstanding the
present desire after innovation, and a love of change, the
contagion has not hitherto spread among the people in this
parish.  Means have indeed been employed to corrupt them,
and to draw the unwary into the pestilent vortex, but by
watchful attention, the malignant efforts of designing men
have hitherto been rendered ineffectual.  There are indeed
some, who have got the hackneyed phrases of the day, "Li-
berty," "Reform," etc. but there are none who have openly
pretended to countenance measures, and practices, which
by every good Christian, and every loyal subject, will ever
be abhorred.  Happy in our monarch, in our constitution,
in our religion, and in our laws, our desire and earnest
prayer is, That our sovereign, and his august family may
long be preserved by the good providence of God, and con-
tinue to sway the sceptre of equity and peace over a happy
people; and that the inestimable constitution they maintain,
and the invaluable rights, civil and sacred, which we enjoy,
may remain until that hour shall come, that shall dissolve the
universe.

     Fortunati! semper,sua si bona norint.
