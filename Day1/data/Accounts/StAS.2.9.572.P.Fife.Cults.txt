  Linen Weaving.-This branch of manufactures gives employ-
ment to a large proportion of the parishioners.  The kind of cloth
woven is Dowlas.  The webs are usually 140 yards long, and 30
inches wide, containing at an average 35 spindles of yarn.  The
materials are supplied by manufacturers in Newburgh, Leslie, and
Kettle, who have agents in the parish.  The number of weavers
is 85 males and 65 females, in all 150.  Of these nearly one-half
are boys or young women under twenty years of age; while more
than a fifth of the whole number are regularly employed at the
loom only during the winter, the remainder being exclusively
weavers, and following, except in harvest, no otber occupation.
The average gross wages per web are 17s., or, deducting 2s. 6d.
for winding, dressing, &c. the clear wages per web may be stated
at 14s. 6d.  The average rent of a loom stance is 9s. per annum.
The number of webs usually wrought in the course of a year can-
not be precisely ascertained; 1700 may be taken as a fair estimate.
Their value when wrought, at an average of L. 5 per web, is
L. 8500, the gross sum paid for weaving them at 17s. is L. 1445,
of which the weavers receive, as their clear wages at 14s. 6d.,
L. 1232, 10s. As to wages per week, few even of the best weavers,
working steadily twelve or fourteen hours a day, will, after clearing
all expenses realize a greater sum weekly than 7s.  The clear ave-
rage wages earned per week may be stated at not more than 5s. for
a Man or woman, and 3s. for a boy or girl.  The weaving of linens,
