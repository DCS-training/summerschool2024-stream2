yielded as good as crop as the rest.  On one little field he
made an experiment of the different effects of lime, marl,
and dung in producing a crop of oats.  The part which
was limed produced a crop, which, even in a wet summer,
stood firm till it was ripe, or at least only leaned with the
weight of the ears, which were indeed very plump.  The
part which was dunged was in every respect similar:  but
the part which was marled produced a crop which, though
not taller than the others, yet was soon laid close to the
ground by the rain; the consequence of which was, that
some of the ears were no better than chaff, and the best
were far inferior to those of the other two.  He is not so
rash as from this single experiment to deduce any conclu-
sion to the prejudice of marl; yet, as he found that
though it might be brought in boats up the Dee, and then
opposite to Newgalloway, the nearest post-town, which is
not above three miles distant, this land-carriage, added to
the water-carriage from Carlingwork Loch, which is about
12 miles from Newgalloway, rendered it more expensive
than lime, he therefore prefers the latter to the former:
Nay, though lime at this distance costs him 2 s. 1 d. and
more frequently 2 s. 2 d. the bushel, containing three
Winchesters, he thinks it the cheapest of all manures for
land at any considerable distance from the dunghill, as six
single cart-loads, each containing five bushels, are sufficient
for an acre of thin hard land, to maket it yield a good crop
of oats; a quantity which is fix times as soon carried the
same distance, and scattered on the land, as the quantity of
dung or marl which would be sufficient for the same ex-
tent.  The tenant of Bogue, which is one of the best arable
farms in the parish, and the fittest for lime, has lately be-
gun to bring lime from Closeburn or Barjarg, which to
him is nearer than Tongland.  The good effects of it are
already so evident, that others are following his example.
