     Statistical Account

years past, a considerable quantity of meal has been annually
imported, it having been necessary to feed their cattle with a
great part of their own crop, during the winter season, espe-
cially when severe.  The seed time begins about the first of
April, and the harvest about the 12th of September.  In
Isle Muck the harvest is somewhat later, and yet the seed-
time somewhat earlier.  Last year, 1793, the crop was not
all got in till near the end of November.  The shores would
produce about 50 tons kelp annually, if the season was very
favourable, but the quantity must depend greatly upon the
weather.  The animals reared in the parish are horses, horn-
ed cattle, sheep, and a few goats.  Horses are reared for sale
in Rum only: They are hardy and high mettled, though of
a small size.  The horned cattle of Canna and Isle Muck
grow to a considerable size, owing to the fineness of their
grass; but, when carried to market, they are liable to a dis-
temper called the bloody urine, which of course reduces their
price.  Most of the farmers in Eigg, and the principal tacks-
man in Canna, rear a few of the smaller sort of sheep for
the use of their families.  One farm in Eigg was begun to
be stocked with black faced sheep, about two years ago.
They seem to multiply and thrive well.  There are no sheep
in Isle Muck.  In Rum, there is a considerable number of
small native sheep; their flesh is delicious, and their wool.
valuable.  A quantity of it is sent yearly to the Redcastle
market, near Inverness, where it often sells at 14 s. the
stone, while other wool sells about half that price.  This
island seems best calculated for rearing sheep, being almost
wholly covered with hills and high mountains, but the pro-
prietor's attachment to the inhabitants, has hitherto prevent-
ed its being stocked with them only.  In Rum there were
formerly great numbers of deer; there was also a copse of
wood, that afforded cover to their fawn from birds of prey,
