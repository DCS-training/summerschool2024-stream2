              Parochial Reqisters.- The parochial registers commence in the
           times of the Reformation.  Including the session records, and the
           accounts connected with the management of the poor, (all of which
           are generally imbodied in different parts of the same volume),
           they extend to thirteen volumes, coming down to the year 1837
           inclusive.  The first entry in the register of baptisms is dated
           December 27, 1553.  Till within thd last three years, there hr no
           separate register of deaths or burials, except from 1783 to 1789
           In the session records, there is a blank between the years 1654
           and 1666; and from the year 1788 to 1819, there are only a few
           detached minutes, but no regular record.
              The early records of the kirk-session contain many curious en-
           tries.  We hope to be indulged in extracting a few lines from
           them, at a period of great interest to the church and the nation-
           that of the glorious Revolution.
              "Sabbath-Sept. 8th 1689.-No sermon because the troopers
           came into ye toun with sound of trumpet and dissipat the people;
           and the Minr. was informed yt they would offer violence to him."
              The minister here referred to was Dr John Nicolson, who was
           soon after deprived, because, as appears from the minute of heri-
           tors and elders, when proceeding (January 1691) to nominate and
           call a successor, he would not submit to the ndw Government, nor
           conform to the ecclesiastical constitution which had then been
           established.  An honourable testimony, however, was borne to his
           faithfulness in the discharge of his ministerial duties.  It is dated
           November 1, 1689, and is expresrdd in the following quaint but
           affecting terms:-
              " The session this day with ane voice declared, yt the doctor
           bad been very painful and faithful in ye exercise of all the points
           and parts of ye ministerial function among yem." *
              Antiquities-There are few antiquities in the parish. Similar to
           the large stone, at the village of Hawkstane, just within the bound-
           ary of the parish of St Madoes, are two others in this parish, both in

                <FOOTNOTE>To this account of the parochial records way be appended a list of all who have
           been ministers of the parish since the Reformation.  This list, the accuracy of which
           has been fully verified, was made out in the year 1822 by Mr Scott, preacher, who
           was at that time contemplated a general index of this kind for every parish in Scot-
           land.  The dates refer to the year of admission: 15--, Alexander Dunmuir.
