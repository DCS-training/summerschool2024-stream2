     General Appendix to [Vol. xii.

Hamilton, who lived to the greatest age, retained her men-
tal faculties to the last.  It may be further added, as to other
instances of longevity in that family, and in the same gene-
ration, that Mr Archibald Hamilton, eldest son of the said
James Hamilton, Esq. of Dalzel, and who succeeded him in
that estate in the year 1727, died in the end of December
1774, aged 81 years; and that Mrs Jean Hamilton, another
daughter of the said James Hamilton, Esq. of Dalzel, who
was married to James Roberton, Esq. of Bedlay, died in
April 1784, aged 83 years.  So that there were 5 persons of
one generation in a family, and all descended from the same
parents, whose ages joined together make up 447 years.
