confined with locked doors; but if he comes out, he loses his 
freedom, unless liberated by the judicial sentence of the ma-
gistrates. None can sell their freedom but to the community, 
who have power to sell it to whom they please, upon paying 
the agreed price.  Males and females equally succeed to the 
freeholds, in which their charter differs from that of New- 
town, renewed much about the same time.  The kirk of 
Prestick still stands, and is an old sabric that sublifted in the 
time of Popery.  The walls are thick, and supported with stone- 
buttresses at the E. end; is distant from the sea less than a 
quarter of a mile, and much exposed to the storms. From it 
there is a beautiful prospect of the Crag of Ailsa, the Hero's 
of Ayr, and the Frith of Clyde, where the ships from Green- 
ock, Saltcoats, and Irvine, are frequently passing outward 
and inward bound; and it serves as a land-mark for ships at 
sea.  Divine service was performed in this church before the 
disjunction and the erection of Newtown, every third Sunday, 
for the most part; but the burgh of Newtown having ob- 
tained a separate erection for themselves, the necessity is su-
perseded, Prestick church being no more than 1 English mile 
from Monktown, and the parish church at present being as 
centrical as could be well devised.
