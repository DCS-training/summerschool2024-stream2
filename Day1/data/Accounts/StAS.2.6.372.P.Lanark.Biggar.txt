	Fuel.-- Almost the only fuel used is coal from Ponfeigh, in the
parish of Douglas, which is about 14 miles distant from Biggar,
and sometimes, though more rarely, from Wilsonton, in the parish
of Carnwath. A cart-load of 15 cwt. is delivered in Biggar for
9s., that is 3s. 3d. for the coals at the mouth of the pit, 10d. for
tolls, and the remainder for driving. Peats, or rather turfs, called
rough-heads, are dug from a moss belonging to the town, and used
as fuel to the extent of about 400 carts yearly, but they are not
reckoned profitable.

           		MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	Few parishes have been more improved than this since the date
of the last Statistical Account; but there are two periods in the
history of its improvement which ought particularly to be noted.
In 1806 the late Mr Stainton bought Biggarshields, containing
1132 Scots acres, and then all let as a sheep-walk for L. 150.
This lease expired in 1817, and during the years 1817, 1818,
1819, and 1820, he reclaimed 600 acres, drained extensively, erect-
ed 18 miles of stone dikes, planted 15 miles of thorn hedges, and
forest trees to the extent of 265 acres. The rental of the pro-
perty is now above L. 600, but two of the farms, consisting wholly
of land not, formerly reclaimed, are let on improving leases for
trifling rents and in the course of ten years, when these leases
shall have expired, the whole of the estate, with the exception of
100 acres too steep for cultivation, will be under the plough, and
the rental not less probably than L. 900.
	In 1830 Mr Gray bought Carwood, containing 947 Scots acres,
since which time he has reclaimed 400, formed fifty enclosures by
stone dikes, thorn hedges, and turf fences, and planted in stripes
and clumps 210 acres. He has, besides this built an excellent
mansion-house, and is engaged in improvements which will soon
treble the rental of his property.
	The greatest improvement which can now be effected in this
parish is the deepening of Biggar water. Were it deepened two
feet for the space of four miles, that is, from Broughton Bridge to
Boghall, 500 acres of land on its banks, but not all in this parish,
would be improved L. 1 per acre. And as the operation would
not, in the opinion of competent judges, cost more than L. 500,
the expence would be repaid in the course of one year. There
are ten proprietors concerned, and it can only be ascribed to the
difficulty of acting in such an improvement is delayed
for a day. The advantage which would result to the climate from
the draining of such a tract of marshy ground would be very great.
