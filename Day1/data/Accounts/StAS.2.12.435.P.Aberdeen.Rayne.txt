                                RAYNE.                                   435

in land, yields an annual rent of L.400, which is managed by the
provincial synod, and distributed through the several presbyteries
in rotation, in sums from L.20 to L.50 to each parish, according
to the relative numbers and necessities of their poor.  And from
this fund the poor of Rayne have received three distributions dur-
ing the last twenty-three years, amounting in all to L.82.
   The first applications for relief from the poor's funds are gene-
rally made with reluctance; but aid being granted chiefly to the
aged and infirm who have no relations able to support them, and
widows with helpless children, the feeling of sbame is in them
gradually overcome by the fear of want.
   Fairs.-The principal fairs in the parish are the Tryst of Wart-
hill, a large cattle-market held annually about Whitsunday N.S.;
Lawrence fair, at Old Rain, also a considerable market, held yearly
at Lammas; a new market in the same place in October; and
Andersmas fair at Kirktown, after Martinmas O.S., besides two
feeing markets for servants, held near Old Rain, before Whitsun-
day and Martinmas respectively.
   Alehouses.-There are at present four alehouses licensed to sell
spirits; a number much greater than is requisite for the accom-
modation of the parishioners and lawful travellers.
   Fuel.-The fuel most used is peat, dug from the extensive bog
or moss already mentioned, about Whitsunday, dried there for six
weeks, and carted home and built in stacks in July.

                       MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   The chief variations betwixt the present state of the parish, and
that in 1794, are 1. The increase of population from 1173 to
1510; 2. The rise of rent from L. 1300 to L. 5650.
   Better parish roads, leading to the several turnpikes, would be
a valuable means of improvement here.
