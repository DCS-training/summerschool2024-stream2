vide them in public worship, they have their lay-leaders, some
of the boldeit and most conceited speakers at fellowhip meet-
ings, whom they implicitly believe, merely on account of
their high tretensions and affected sanctity, by which they im-
pose upon the people, and frequently mistead them.  Of late
they have begun to keep fellowship meetings amongst them-
selves, without the presence of a minister.  To these meetings
they covene at certain fixed periods from different parishes,
propose questions in divinity, explain scriptures, and give a
sanction to any doctrines or opinions that are considered as

been able as yet to devise a method of suppressing them; if
they are allowed to proceed, it is not easy to say, in what they
will terminate at last*.

*The remains of several picfish buildings are to be seen; one on the shore
below the church, which with its out-works, covered a great extent of
ground, is almost effaced, as most of the stones used in building the manse
and church were dug out of its ruins, as were likewise very lately the stones
of a farm house.  In digging these last several deer-horns and human bones
were found.
   A green mote stood on the banks of the river of Loth, which the gentle-
man that now possesses Lothbeg ordered to be dug up.  There appeareda
a subterraneous dwelling, surrounded on the outside with large flat stones,
which seem to have made a part of the wall; the rubbish was cleared away,
and the stones, left in the same situation in which they were in the old fa-
brick.
   In an adjacent field, the same gentleman having ordered the ground to be
cleared of some cairns, in order to inclose it, there were two stone-coffins
found, and in them several urns of clay-ware, which the workmen broke
with their spades before they discovered them.  On the shore, in several
places where there was a beautiful surface of grass about 36 years ago, breach-
es have been made by sand-blowing, that have discovered about ten or twelve
feet below that surface, of which some detached spots remain, an area of
