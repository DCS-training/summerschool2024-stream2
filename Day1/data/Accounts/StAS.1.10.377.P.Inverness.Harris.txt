many churches among the Scottish and Pictish nations.  Who

The churches of more modern date are called after saints,

St Bryde, St Rufus, St Luke, St Mary.  All these, together
with the smaller chapels belonging to them, depended im-

period to have depended on the Abbey of Holyroodhouse,
which was built and endowed by the same King David, A.D.

Heaven.  But many circumstances lead us to place the anti-
