sent wages of men are from L. 6 to L. 7 Sterling per annum;
and of women, from L. 2 to L. 3 Sterling.

   Prices of Provisions.-Provisions have risen one third in the
course of 20 years.  Mutton, lamb, veal, and beef, are from
3 d. to 4 d per pound; a hen, 1 s.; ducks, 8 d.; geefe, 3 s.;
eggs, 3 d. a dozen.  The only kind of provisions that have
not risen are pork, which is 4 d. per pound, and rabbits 6 d.
a-piece, owing to the common people having an aversion to
pork and rabbits.

   Church.-The parish church appears to be a very antient
building, from the remains of a large choir, and the gothic
structure of the steeple.  It was nes-roosed in the year 1761.
The manse was built in 1703, and repaired in 1761.  Sir
John Anstruther of Anstruther, Bart. is patron of the parish.
The present incumbent was ordamed in 1768, is married, and
has a son and two daughters.  The stipend, valuing the vic-
tual at 12 s. per boll, is about L. 90 per annum, exclusive of
the manse and glebe.

   School.-The schoolmaster has a salary of L. 8:6:8 per
annum.  The heritors pay the rent of his dwelling house and 
school, and the session pays him 10 merks a year for teach-
ing poor children.  The dues are, for reading English, 14 d.
a quarter; writing, 1 s. 6 d.; Latin, 2 s. 6 d; and naviga-
tion, L. 1:1:o.  As the schoolmaster is esteemed the best
teacher of navigation on the coast, his chief attention is di-
rected to that branch.  All the young people in the parish,
without a single exception, are taught to read English, and the
principles of the Christian religion.
