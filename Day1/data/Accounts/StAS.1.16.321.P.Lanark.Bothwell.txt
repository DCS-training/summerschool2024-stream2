Bothwell Church.-Bothwell church, or quire, is an old
structure, in the Gothic style, of excellent workmanship,
70 feet in length over the walls, and 39 in breadth.  It is
still entire, and used for public worship; only the portico,
at the west end, was taken down 1719, to admit of a mo-
dern addition, to accommodate the congregation.  The roof
is arched and lofty, and from within makes a very fine ap-
pearance.  It is lighted with a tire of large windows on
each side, and a great window in the east end; in the up-
per part of which the Douglas arms are cut, and at the
south corner of the window, within and without, quartered
in stone with the Royal arms, probably pointing to the
Earl of Douglas's marriage with King Robert's grand-
daughter.  The Hamilton arms are engraved in the centre
of the arch, which supports what is called the organ loft.
The arched roof is covered with large polished flags of
stone, somewhat in the form of pan-tiles.  The whole edi-
fice is composed of stone, strengthened by pilasters, to sup-
port the weight of the roof.  There are no ornaments or
inscriptions; but near the outer base of the spire, the name
of the master-mason is written in Saxon characters,
     Magister Thomas Tron.

   A cell is placed upon the back wall, which enters from
within, where the font bason, of stone, built in the wall,
and the stone pitcher, standing in the middle of the paved
vault, are yet complete.
   In the two east corners of the church, are two sepulchral
monuments of the Earl of Forfar and son.
