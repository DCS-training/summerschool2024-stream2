                        PARISH OF TARVES.

             PRESBYTERY OF ELLON, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

                 THE REV. FRANCIS KNOX, MINISTER.

                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-SOME suppose Tarves to be compounded of two Gae-
lic words, signifying respectively fertile and plain.  The designa-
tion of the parish would thus be a tolerable description of its ap-
pearance, compared with that of more hilly districts.
   Situation and Extent.-Tarves is situated in that part of Aber-
deenshire called Formartine, * with the exception of a small sec-
tion which lies on the north side of the river Ythan, and is there-
fore reckoned in the Buchan district of the same county.  It is
bounded on the north, by Fyvie, Methlick, and New Deer; on
the east, by Ellon; on the south-east and south, by Udny; on the
south-west, by Bourtie; and on the west, by Meldrum.  The
church is distant from Newburgh, the nearest sea-port, ten,
and from Aberdeen the county town, seventeen miles.  In its
greatest length, Tarves may be about 12 miles, and in its great-
est breadth about 8 miles.  It contains upwards of 12,000 Scotch
acres, of which 11,000 are arable, 1000 woodland, and the
residue moss and muir.
   Geology and Hydrography.-The appearance of the parish is
of an undulating character, the land sometimes rising into
sloping acclivities, and sometimes stretching out into levels of con-
siderable extent.  The acclivities are of various altitudes, and
commonly in the form of ridges, sloping most frequentlv to the
south-west and north-east.  The lower grounds are intersected
by numerous small rivulets, vernacularly called burns, which carry
off the drainage to the river Ythan.  This stram divides the pa-
rish into two very unequal parts, the greater being on the southern

<FOOTNOTE>Formartine gives the title of Viscount to the Earl of Aberdeen.
