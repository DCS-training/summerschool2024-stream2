with the assistance of his children.  But, amidst these flatter-
ing prospects, his lease is at an end.  With his family, he
must remove he knows not whither, and leave the fruits of
his laborious and painful industry to another; a stranger, per-
haps, or even an enemy, who has long envied him.  While
such is the state of leases, can the country be cultivated with
spirit and effect?  To accomplish this, the farmer must have
something like the idea of property in his possession, or, at
least, the highest degree of probability of transmitting it to
his children.  To render this equally advantagous to the
landlord and to the tenant, the form of a lease, proposed in
his book on husbandry, by the very ingenious, learned, and
patriotic Lord KAMES, seems to be more effectual, than any
other hitherto offered to the public*.

   Horses.-There is a very excellent breed of large, strong,
handsome horses.  They are brought from Lanarkshire when

*As this book is not in the hands of a great many, and as it is read, per-
haps, but by few, his Lordship's form of a lease is here copied. "In order to

"to a renewal of it, upon paying the proprietor a fifth part more of rent, un-
"less the proprietor give him ten years purchase of that fifth part.  For ex-
"ample; the rent is 100 l.; the tenant offers 120 l.:  He shall therefore continue
"in the possession another 19 years, at the advanced rent, unless the landlord
"pay him 200 l.  Should the tenant offer a still higher additional rent, the pro-
"prietor cannot turn him out, unless he pay him ten years purchase of that
"offer."
