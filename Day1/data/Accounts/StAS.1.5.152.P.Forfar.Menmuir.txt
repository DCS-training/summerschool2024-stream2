'priated to religious use.'  As Catertbun, at a little di-
stance, appears to be of a conic shape, and has a range
of stones about its summit like a crater, some travellers
imagine it to have been formerly a volcano.  This may be
the case with some other hills in the north Scotland; but
the structure in question is plainly a work of art, and not of
nature.  There is nothing like lava which might point out
the operation of internal fire; nothing like the vitrification
of these Highland castles formed by artificial fusion, neither
is there any mark of masonry; so that it must rank with
Duneval and Dunjardel in Inverness and Nairmshire, and o-
ther fortifications of dry stone.  With regard to the main ob-
ject, the time when, and the people by whom this strong
hold was first erected, history is silent, and consequently re-
course must be had to the most probable conjecture.  Little
need be said on this head after the suppossitions of Messrs
Pinkerton and Pennant, whose writings with those of others
may easily be consulted.  The last of these authors has gi-
ven, in one of his first tours in Scotland, a view of Cater-
thun, with its dimensions.  Some people in this country
would trace the origin of Caterthun no higher than what
in the Celtic its name implies, 'the Thieves-hill; but this
seems to fix it to an aera much too recent.  That the
northern freebooters, or Catterin, as they are vulgarly call-
ed, availed themselves in their expeditions southward, of
this and other places of strength, there is no doubt.  On this
account also it might receive its present name; but it has
been clearly a strong camp before the period of their incur-
sions, probably in the Danish or Caledonian wars.  Some
suppose Tacitus speaks of this place in his history, and 'tis
also said, that in later days the celebrated Marquis of Mon-
trose and his army signe the Solemn League and Covenant
