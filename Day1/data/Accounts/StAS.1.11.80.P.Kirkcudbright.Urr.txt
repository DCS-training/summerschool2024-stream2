more schools than one would be necessary.  The salary of the
present schoolmaster is 200 merks Scotch; and, from this
pittance, 3 l. Sterling is abstracted, for the hire of a person
to keep a school in the moorish part of the parish.  For such
an encouragement, it is not to be expected that teachers of very
respectable qualifications can be found.  It is the cry of many
affluent people, however, "The most indifferent schoolmaster
"can teach a young person to read, and subscribe his name.
"This is education sufficient.  Why should we make our
"tenants and cotters better men than their fathers?" To
mention no other absurdity contained in this argument, seve-
ral gentlemen, holding this language, seem little to be aware,
how far they expose their own families to the recollection of
the world.  As to ignorance of history, it may well be ex-
cused, when people do not remember their own grandfathers.
As to those also who think that ability descends by entail, or
is secured by feudal title, it could be wished their opinions
were more frequently justified by their conduct.  The jea-
lousy, which the more powerful and affluent part of society
have shewn, for some time past, with respect to the extension
of knowledge, might profitably be contrasted with the con-
duct of Scotland, for at least an age after the Reformation.
If inattention to the wants of the public, in respect of reli-
gious, moral, and even useful instruction much longer pre-
vails; is contempt and harshness towards those most oppressed,
and most deserving citizens, called parish school-masters, re-
mains unabated, people, who have most to lose, have greatest
reason to dread the consequences.  Nil veri, nil sancti, nulla
deorum metus, nulla religio, may soon be the character of any
man, or any number of men; but, of this description, we
read but of few, in the course of 3000 years, who have given
cause for the doubt, nescio mirabilior fuit adversis quam se-
curidis rebus.
