enabled to breed the best cattle, and fatten them in the
highest degree for the butcher.  His example and success,
roused the gentlemen and farmers to begin and pursue his
mode, and raised an uncommon spirit of improvement in
this place.  The farmers having exhausted the marl, im-
prove the land now with lime from England, imported at
the harbour of Tongland, at the rate of 1 s. and 1 s. 1 d. the
Carlisle bushel, which is equal to about 3 Winchester bushels.
They make use of sea-shells as a manure, which they im-

and form a rich pasture for feeding their cattle.  They are

upon the tenants to a racked rent in its natural state.  This

to the success of agriculture, and to the general good of the
country.  The industrious farmer, in the scale of society,
merits due encouragement from the proprietors of land in
every well regulated state.  It is to be hoped, that their
