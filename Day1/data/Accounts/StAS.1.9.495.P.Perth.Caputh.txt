   Size of Farms, Crops, Rent, etc.-  Farms are in general
small; many under 40 acres, and from 40 to 60 or 80;
seldom above 100.  There are two tenants, who, renting
two or three farms, have in their possession 150 or 160
acres.  A threshing mill was erected in 1792 by a spirited
farmer, on a farm of 120 acres.  The principal crops in
the parish are, oats, barley or bear, pease and flax.  Wheat
has been sometimes tried by way of experiment; but a
crop of barley is more profitable.  The culture of potatoes
is universal.  Turnips are cultivated only in south and
east parts of the parish, where the soil is light and warm.
Early oats are sown in the N. W. part of the parish,
where the soil is cold.  A great quantity of clover and rye-
grass is sown usually among barley.  Oats are sown from

time been found in the parish.  The country was uninclosed, except
what was in the immediate neighbourhood of the houses of great proprie-
tors.  In the year 1735, the best ploughman was to be had for L.8 Scots
(13 s.4 d.) a-year, and what was termed a bounty, which consisted of
some articles of clothing, and might be estimated at its 6 d.; in all L. 1,
4 s. 10 d. Sterling.  Four years after, his wages rose to L. 24 Scots, (L 2)
and the bounty.  Female servants received L. 2. Scots, (3 s. 4 d.) and a
bounty of a similar kind; the whole nor exceeding 6 s. or 7 s.  Some
years after their wages rose to 15 s.  Men received for harvest-work
L. 6 Scot, (10 s.); Women, L. 5 Scots, (8 s. 4 d.).  Poultry was sold at
40 pennies Scots, (3 1/3 d.) Oat-meal, bear and oats, at L. 4 or L. 5 Scots
the boll.  A horse that then cost 100 merk, Scots, (L.: 11:1 1/3) would 
now cost L. 25.  An ox that cost L. 20 Scots (L. 1: 13: 4) would now
be worth L. 8 or L. 9.  Beef and mutton were sold, not by weight, but
by the piece; about 3 s. 4 d. for a leg of beef of 3 1/2 stones; and so in pro-
portion.  No tea nor sugar was used: Little whisky was drunk, and less of
other spirits: but they had plenty of good ale; there being usually one
malt-barn (perhaps two) on each farm.  They caught abundance of sal-
mon in the Tay; 150 have been taken in one night, with very imperfect
Bets, in a space not exceeding 200 yards in length.  For many years pass.
they have not caught as many in one season, and in the whole parish.
Neither was salmon sold by weight: One could have been purchased for 18
pence which would now cost 18 Shilings, at the same season of the year.
