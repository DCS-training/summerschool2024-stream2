   But this is given merely as a conjecture.  For though ma-
ny of the stones have been removed, there never has been
found the smallest vestige of any inscription, nor even of any
character whatever upon them.
   The tumuli in this parish are probably of equal antiquity
with the chesters.  These however, have never been nume-
rous, or considerable; and they have all been rased to the
foundation, for many years.  The larger stones have been
used for building inclosures, the smaller for the highways.
I have been able only to trace the site of two of these tumuli.
The one at a field near Auchincloch, which I am told in
Gallic, signifies a field of stones.  The other about 600 yards
east from Chapel green.  That they were erected as monu-
ments over the dead is generally allowed, as urns contain-
ing the ashes of the dead, have been found in most, if not in
all that have been examined.
   But the question still remains, by what nation were they
erected?  If by the native Caledonians, why have urns been
found in them, with evident marks of the bodies having been
burnt?  If by other nations, whence came they?  For though
some may be supposed to be Roman, they cannot all be so,
as the greatest part of them are beyond the Roman boundary.
And yet there is a very striking similarity in the structure of
them, which would argue they were the work of one nation.
But for what end were such mighty piles huddled together,
in such a rude confused mass, and with such immense labour
and drudgery, upon the summit of very high hills too, where

   The Ban-hill, seems to me to have been the most important fort.  It is
nearly centrical; and commands a view of the wall for nearly half its length;
and it overlooks the whole strath to the north.  Besides, it is nearly opposite
to the only narrow place of the valley; where a passage could be forced with
the greatest expedition.
