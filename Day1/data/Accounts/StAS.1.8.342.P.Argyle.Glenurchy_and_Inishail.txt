the distemper.  It spread over the country in a short time;
but contagious as it was, it was not mortal.

   Mountains, etc*.-There are many hills of different eleva-
tions and forms in the parish.  Among these, Beindoran,
Beinlaoi, and Cruachan, soar pre-eminently high.  The last
rises in a gentle slope from the sea, and the Lake of Aw; and
by the measurement of the late Colonel Watson, with a quadrant,
its perpendicular height is said to be 1130 yards above the
level of the sea.  The circumference of the mountain, at the
base, is above 20 measured miles.  Cruachan is the weather
gauge of the people within view of its lofty summit.  Before
the storm, "the spirit of the mountain shricks," and its head
and tides are enveloped in clouds.  On the summit of this
mountain, was that fatal spring, from which, according to the
tradition of our fathers, issued forth the beautiful and exten-
sive lake of Aw ++.
