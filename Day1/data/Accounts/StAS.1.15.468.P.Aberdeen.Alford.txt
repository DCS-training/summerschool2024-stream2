effectual bar to improvements of every kind; and especially
to the culture of grass and corn crops.
   The wages of farm servants have been very greatly raised
within these few years in this country, owing to the great
demand and high price of labour in Angus, the Mearns, and
Southern parts of Scotland, together with that occasioned by
the number of extensive manufactories, recently erected in
Aberdeen.  Forty years ago, a man's yearly wages were from
16 L. Scotch, or 1 L. 6 s. 8 d. Sterling, to 1 L. 13 s. 4 d. and a wo-

of them is a much higher article than their wages, especially
where there are many mouths; and when, in addition to
to these pecuniary disadvantages, the difficulty in procuring
servants, their waste, indolence, carelessness, and insolence,
are taken into account, it is not to be wondered at, that the
expence of farm servants, in this country, cuts very deep up-
on the produce of the farm, or (as the tenants generally say)
that it is a greater burden on them than their rent.  Besides
the ordinary servants of his farm, a farmer has to provide a
number of extra hands for his harvest work.  This work is
never done by the piece or day, but an agreed-upon-sum, to-
gether with the reapers victuals, (frequently accompanied by
