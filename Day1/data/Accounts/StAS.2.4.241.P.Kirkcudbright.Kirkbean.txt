farther, than the necessary improvement upon house required at
entry. The rents of the farms in this parish may vary from
60 to 600 guineas per annum, but many of them will require a
considerable reduction unless there is an increase in the price of
farm produce.
	Produce.--The average amount of raw produce may be esti-
mated nearly as follows:--42 bushels per Scotch acre of oats,
40 bushels per acre of barley, 30 bushels per acre of wheat,
which, at the average price of late years in this part of the coun-
try, may be stated at 2s. 6d. per imperial bushel of oats, 3s. per
do. of barley; and L.5s. 6d. per do. of wheat; L.6 per acre, oats;
L.6 per do. barley; and L.8, 5s. per do. wheat, all Scotch mea-
sure, which gives a gross amount for all grain raised in the parish.

The land pastured by cattle and sheep is so very unequal, that it is al-
  most impossible to arrive at any thing like accuracy, but may be
  stated at                                                             2300 0 0

	The navigation connected with, Kirkbean is very limited. Only
two or three small vessels, of about fifty tons burthen, belong to
parishioners. These are engaged in the coal and grain trade with
the opposite coast of Cumberland, Liverpool, and Glasgow. A
wooden pier has lately been erected at Carsethorn for the accom-
modation of the Liverpool steam-packet, which makes two voyages
weekly in summer, and one in winter, and has been of great ad-
vantage to the farmers for conveying their fat stock, &c. to a bet-
ter market than is to be found nearer home. All vessels from
Dumfries, when meeting with contrary winds, anchor in the bay

<FOOTNOTE>For the above agricultural observations and calculations, which are necessarily
much abridged, the public is indebted to Mr Paterson in Pretton,and Mr Smith in
Ladyland, two of the most active and intelligent farmers in the south of Scotland.
It would also be unpardonable, were it not here stated, that this parish, which in an
agricultural point of view, ranks among the first in the district, was early imbued with
a taste for improvement, by the talents and philantrophic energy of the late William
Craig, Esq. of Arbigland, who devoted a very long life to the unwearied endeavour
to promote the interests of the parish and of his country at large.
