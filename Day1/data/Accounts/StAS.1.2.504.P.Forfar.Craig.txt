built over the Southesk, (with the near prospect of which we
are now flattered,) the communication will be much easier,
and attended with many additional conveniences.-Another
advantage is the easy aceess which the farmers have to lime
At Bodden, in this parish, there is a lime-work carried on to
great extent; and, to that spot, all the improvements in hus-
bandry, made in this country, is, in a great measure owing.
The greatest disadvantage, is the high price of coals, owing to
the heavy duty, which takes place here.  This tax is much
complained of, as evidently partial, impolitic, and unreason-
able.  A small duty laid at the pit, would yield much more to
government than the present one; and the burden being laid
equally upon all, would be much more easily borne, and could
scarcely be objected to, on any just and reasonable grounds.
