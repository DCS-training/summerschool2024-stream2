     Of Glenmuick, Tulloch, and Glengairn.

ny of them manufacture their own wool into coarse blue, or
tartan webs, which fell at 2 s., or 2 s. 6 d. the ell.

   Manners, etc.-The people are honest, economical, sober,
contented, and hospitable; very regular in attending upon di-
vine worship, and warmly attached to their country; their
language is English, except in the upper parts of the parishes
of Tulloch and Glengairn, where some of them use a barba-
rous dialect of the Gaelic among themselves, but they all un-
derstand the English.  Their size, in general, is from 5 feet
5 inches, to 5 feet 8 inches high: they are stout made, healthy,
and capable of great fatigue.  Fevers of different kinds pre-
vail sometimes; but there is no disease peculiar to the coun-
try.  The air is pure and dry, and reckoned very wholesome:
and yet there is only one instance of extreme old age remem-
bered here.  A John Mitchell, aged 124, born in the parish
of Glenmuick in 1598, and died in 1722; the date of his
birth and death is still very legible on his tomb-stone.  The
fuel used here is peats and turfs from adjacent hills: they
are both good of their kinds, but attended with great ex-
pense, as they lie at the back of very steep mountains.

   Population, etc.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the
number of souls then, was 2270.  At present the population,
etc. is as follows:

<FOOTNOTE>

*That the number of males should be so much less than that of the females,
is owing to many of the young men going to the South and Low Countries to
service, because they cannot get employment at home.
