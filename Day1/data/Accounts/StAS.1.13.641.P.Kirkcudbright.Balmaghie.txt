being made to yield a return adequate to the expense of such
an operation.  There are mosses too of great extent, which,
if they are not more beautiful, are at least of more value,
as they afford an abundant supply of suel to the inhabitants,
and serve to relieve the want of their neighbours.  There 
are a few bleak rugges hills, which rise to a considerable 
height, and are incapable of improvement:  But the parish
in general cannot be said to be mountainous.  Along the
eastern and southern skirts of it, nature has been more li-
beral of her savours, and human industry has begun to give 
proofs of its power.  Here are verdant and fertile meadows,
which, before the use of artificial grasses was known, were 
let as high as the best arable land is at this day. The ap-
pearance and condition of the dry ground here, have been 
changed and improved by the application of lime imported
from England, and of excellent shell-marl found in Carhn-
wark Loch.  There is some natural wood; and a few plan-
tations have been made, which are in a thriving state:  But
still there is too much reason to consider hedges and trees 
as rarities in Galloway.

   Rivers and Lakes.-The Dee, (commonly called the black
water of Dee), runs along the north side of the parish, and 
forms the line of separation between it and Kells.  At the 
north-east corner of Balmaghie, the junction of this river
with the Ken is formed.  Here the two rivers, made one 
and indivisible, assume the name of the Dee, and proceed-
ing in their course along the eastern, and a part of the south-
ern border of this parish, disjoin it from Parton, Crossimi-
chael, and Kelton. (For a more particular account of this 
great body of water, the reader is referred to the First Vo-
lume of this Work, Numbers XXI, and XXII.) There
