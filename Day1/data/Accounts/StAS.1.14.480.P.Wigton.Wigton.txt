authentick documents, it was not much above 400 L. Ster-
ling; whereas, in the year 1793, from an account pretty
accurately taken, it is found to be almost as much above
2000 L.  The valuation of the parish is no more than
1602 L. 14 s. Scots.  The valued bears the less proportion
to the real rent, as 4 or 5 of the best farms, which hold
burgage of the town of Wigton, are not included in the
valuation.

   Population.-The population of this parish, within these
last 40 years, has greatly increased.  In the year 1755,
the number of inhabitants, according to Dr. Webster's
account, was no more than 1032.  In 1793, from an e-
numeration taken by the present incumbent, they were
found to amount to 1350.  None of this increase belongs
to the country part of the parish, the population of which,
far from being increased, is diminished.  It belongs wholly
to the town; and though, perhaps, owing partly to the
growth of opulence, has arisen chiefly from two other
causes; from the enlargement of farms, which has led many
families which resided in the country, to settle in the town;
and from the influx of people from Ireland, who are scat-
tered over the whole of this county, and of whom above
100 at present reside within the town of Wigton.  As a
register of marriages, of births, and burials, has not been
kept, for a considerable time past, the annual number of
these cannot be precisely ascertained.  The marriages, how-
ever, are generally prolific, and the number of births to
each of them, may, on an average, be rated at 6.

   Health.-The salubrity of this place appears from the
health of its inhabitants.  The town of Wigton, from its
high, open, and marine situation, is naturally healthful;
