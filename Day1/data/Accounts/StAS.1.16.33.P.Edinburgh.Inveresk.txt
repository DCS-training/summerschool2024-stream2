   Longevity.-There are always many aged people in this
parish, and what is of more importance, they preserve
their vigour and their faculties to the last.  There are,
and have been many women past fourscore, who travel to
Edinburgh with their creels, and return by mid day;
men of the same age are many of them not past la-
bour; and there are a few persons at present living in this
parish, who, though approaching to go, are as stout and
lively as some others of threescore*.  The oldest person
now living is a woman of 94, who carried the creel in her
youth, and still spins.

   Law.-There is but one resident writer or attorney in
the parish, who is the town-clerk.  As all the small causes
commence at the town-court, the parties in general are in-
duced to acquiesce in the first judgment, whether they
think it right or wrong, as there is no advice at hand to
tempt them to carry it sarther.  Custom has taught them
to submit of the first decision, which happily prevents the
entail of seuds and endless litigation upon them.

   Morals and Manners.-The people of this parish are
not free from such vices, as are incident to persons in their
situation.  The faults that are attached to dealers in small
articles are not uncommon among them, but great crimes
are very rare.  Large cities are the nurseries of crimes, as
they furnish the means of privacy and concealment, as
well as of temptation.  But populous villages, if not fa-
vourable to some of the virtues, are the leaft discouraging
to scandalous vices; because, in so close a neighbourhood,
every action is perfectly known, and there is no censorial
power half so effectual as the opinion of equals.  Few great

(1792) aged 91. and might probably have lived to 100, had he not first
broke his leg, and afterwards, before it was recovered, fallen into the fire,
and been scurched to death.
