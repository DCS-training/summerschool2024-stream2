   Extent and produce.-Only a part of the parish has been
measured.  It contains, by the most exact calculation, about 
5000 acres, of which 1450 are arable.  Of these there are 
at present about 460 in tillage, viz. 380 in oats, 50 in bear,
15 in pease, 5 in flax, 5 in potatoes, and 5 in turnips.  There
are about 80 acres in clover and rye-grass, 3860 in pasture.
250 in the lakes above mentioned, and 350 in planting.
There are 3 commons, containing between 200 and 300 acres.
They are not of great value, and will probably be soon divid-
ed.  The parish does not at present supply itself with provi-
sions.  A considerable quantity of oat meal is required.
Much of the best arable land is at present in grass.  Pastur-
ing is found to be very profitable, as it requires little trouble
or expence.  Farmers and graziers often rent one or more
inclosures, either for fassening cattle, or rearing young cattle
and horses.  If the parish were fully cultivated, it could do
more than maintain its inhabitants in every kind of grain.
At present it is computed to produce as much meal, poultry,
roots, butter, and cheese, etc. as is equal (exclusive of the 
beef and mutton) to the maintainance of the people.

   Improvements.-The parish has certainly, of late, improved
considerably in agriculture.  Clover, rye-grass, and tur-
nips, are found to be of great advantage:  The quantity of
potatoes, raised by the farmers, is but inconsiderable; but a
great many of the poorer sort of people, have some potatoe
ground, the produce of which makes a principal part of their
food for more than half the year.  Mr Adam of Maryburgh.
and his son, John Adam, Esq; M. P. the present proprietor,
were the first persons, in this part of the country, who gave
an example in the improvement of land, by inclosing, planting,
and raising artificial grasses, cabbages, and turnips.  By them
some millions of trees have been planted, a considerable part
