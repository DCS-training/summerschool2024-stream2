few in number, small in size, and not pleasant to the taste.
This desease is not mentioned here, as supporting it peculiar to
the parish, which is the subject of this description:  For it
seems, that it has been severely felt in many other parts in
Britain, and has occasioned various dissertations, none of which
are said to be satisfactory.  But, as it is believed, that it was ob-
served to make its appearance about this town, before it was
known any where in the country immediately around it; and,
as it is an important article in the natural history of this most
valuable root, which has not yet been fully investigated; this
hint may not be improper to excite more accurate inquiries con-
concerning its cause and cure*.

*This disease first made its appearance in the neighbourhood
of Hamilton, about the year 1770, or 1771, and has since been
gradually gaining ground, insomuch that people have sometimes
almost intirely lost their crops, without knowing how that loss
could have been prevented.  Many contradictory causes have been
assigned for this extraordianry phenomenon, all of them, perhaps,
conjectural.  The most popular and plausible, is, that the root
degenerates by being too long planted in a country, widely diffe-
rent from its native soil and climate; and, that to prevent this evil,
it ought to be renovated, by obtaining new ones from the feed
contained in the apple.  But waving all speculative reasoning on
the subject, one plain fact is a sufficient objection to that hypothe-
sis; namely, that the disease never made its appearance till after
those renovated potatoes  were introduced, and has increased as
they have been multiplied.  It must, nevertheless, be acknowledg-
ed, that raising new potatoes from the apple for feed has been of
considerable service.  They become fit to be discriminated, and
cut into sets for feed the second year; and, when proper kinds are
chosen, and the other varieties, with which they are always accom-
