     Statistical Account

tween these rocks run small hollow vales, where sheep and
goat find pasture; and at the bottom of the hill, on the
same side, are several caves in which sea-fowl and wild
pigeons nestle, and into some of which the sea, at high
water, enters.  The hill itself, on account of its height and
peculiar form, is an infallible mark of the situation and
place of the harbour.  On the slopes of Air Suidhe Thuin,
N. W. from the harbour, are to be seen the remains of a
naturals wood, consisting chiefly of birch and alder, which
about 20 years ago, it is said, was in a tolerable good con-
dition, but is now much decayed.  About 30 years ago,
some firs were planted on the farm of Scorribreae‘, north side
of the entry to Portree; but, on account of its easterly ex-
posure, and the sea air, they did not thrive well.  No more
than 500 or 600 trees, well sheltered, have arrived at any
degree of perfection.  In Raasay, there are two or three
spots of natural wood, which, being usually well kept, are
of no small use to the inhabitants and their neighbours,
and of considerable emolument to the proprietor.  The
late Raasay planted several spots near his house, of which
the parts better sheltered have done well; those more ex-
posed have thriven but indifferently.
   There are many fresh water lochs, of which two only
are worthy of notice, Loch fud and Loch-leathan, or the
Long Loch and Broad Loch, one of them being long, and
the other shorter, but much broader.  They are in the
north end of the parish, very highly situated, of consider-
able extent, and contain great plenty of white and red
trout, flounder, and eel.  The trout of Loch-leathen are in
general very large, some of them weighing from 1 to 2,
or 2 1/2 lb.  They have no communication with the sea, but
one from Loch-leathen, over a very high and extraordinary
steep precipice, which forms a singular and curious cascade,
that from the sea below appears beautiful and grand be-
