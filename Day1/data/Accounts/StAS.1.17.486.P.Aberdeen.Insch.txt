mand for labour about towns on the sea coast, drew off a
number of people to reside in the royal boroughs, or manu-
facturing towns.  It is now chiefly in those parishes, in which
manufacturing villages are found, that the population is in-
creasing.  In all probability, however, it will increase for
some time.  The introduction of potatoes has added much
to the quantity of human food; and with an increase of
provision, there will always be an increased population.

   Village.-The town of Insch, where the church stands, is
situated at the southern extremity of the parish.  It is a
burgh of barony, has a weekly market, and two or three
yearly fairs; but they are much on the decline.  The car-
rying the canal to this village would be attended with im-
portant advantages, as it would become the market place for
all the upper parts of the Garioch.  The feuers of this
town are heritable proprietors of their houses and small
gardens.  They are either shopkeepers or mechanics; and
they rent small farms from Colonel Hay of Rannes, who is
superior of the town, and proprietor of the lands in the
neighbourhood.

   Manufactures.-The knitting of stockings for the the Aber-
deen manufacturers is the principal employment of the wo-
men of this district.  It is at present at a stand; and, from
various causes, is presumed to be on the decline.

   Antiquities.-The old castle, built on the top of the coni-
cal hill of Dun o-deer, is a very great curiosity.  Tradition
says it was built by King Gregory the Great, more than 900
years ago; yet a considerable part of the walls are still
standing; and the materials of which the walls are built are
of a angular kind, and have given rise to various conjectures.
