a great expense, as the nearest quarry of the kind is above
4 miles distant, and the hill very inaccessible.  This
building has been one of those places of strength with
which the country formerly abounded, and has been encir-
cled by several large mounds of earth, which are still
very visible.  There is an extensive prospect of the sur-
rounding country to be enjoyed from the top of this
hill.  An old Roman way runs through the parish;
and at this distant day from its formation, is in many
places quite uncovered with grass.  Its direction is from
E. to W., along the face of the hills.  There are several
tumuli of stones.  There is one tumulus of earth of con-
siderable size.  None of them have been opened.  In
the Shinnel, there is a deep fall of water called the Aird
Linn, which is occasionally visited by those who delight
in grand and striking objects.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The price of labour is
much raised of late years.  An ordinary farm man-
servant draws 8 L. or 9 L. a-year.  A maid-servant from
3 L. to 4 L.  Harvest wages a-day 8 d., with victuals, or
1 s. without them.  But the general practice is hiring
labourers to remain in the house during the harvest
weeks.  The roads are much improved since the com-
mutation of the statute-labour.  Much inconvenience is
felt from the great distance of a weekly market, the
nearest being Dumfries, which is above 16 miles.
