     Statistical Account

deserves attention.  About the year of our Lord 1150, it is
said there was a battle fought between the English and
Scots, on Glenquicken Moor, wherein the Scots were de-
feated and their General killed, and that the Bishop of Whi-
thorn being along with him in the engagement, immediately
assumed the command; but his troops being defeated, imme-
diately fled towards the shore to their boats, but being over-
taken by the enemy at Cairnholy, about half a mile from the
shore, the bishop, with many other gentlemen, was killed,
and was buried here, and that from this circumstance it was
called the Holy Cairn, the bishop being a holy man.  Cer-
tain it is, that on the very place where the battle is said
to have been fought, there is a large tumulus which was
opened about 15 years ago (the stones being carried a-
way for the purpose of building dykes) when there was dis-
covered a stone coffin, or stones placed together in form of a
coffin, wherein was a human skeleton, the scull and the great
bones almost entire, and greatly above the ordinary size; also
an urn, containing some ashes, and an earthen pitcher: the tu-
mulus is called Cairnywanie.*  At a small distance from the
above, there is a Druidical temple, or a Danish encampment,
but, being left to the uncertainty of conjecture, shall not ha-
zard an opinion; there are also several other tumuli in the
parish, that have never been opened There are also four
square towers with battlements, which seem to have been
intended for defence: they are all placed on the banks of the
Cree.

<FOOTNOTE>

*There is a little rivulet or burn that runs through the place where the
battle is said to have been fought, that still retains the name of the English-
man's Burn.
