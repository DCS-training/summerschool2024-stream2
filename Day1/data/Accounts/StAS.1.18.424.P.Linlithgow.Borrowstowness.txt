lithgow found it necessary, that Borrowstownness should be
erected into a parish by itself, bounded on the south, by
Graham's dyke; on the north, by the sea; on the east, by
Thirlestone, and on the west, by the castle wall, commonly
called "Capie's wall."  In December 1669, the Duke and
Duchess of Hamilton, obtained an act of the Scotch Parlia-
ment, declaring the church lately built within the town to be
"the kirk of the hail barony of Kinniel and Borrowstown-
"ness."  From that period, the parishes have been united,

and considered as one.  The parish now is about 4 English
miles in length, from east to west, and about 2 1/2 in breadth,
from south to north.
   Nearly of a triangular form, it is bounded on the east and
south, by the parishes of Carridden and Linlithgow; on the
west and south, by the river Avon, which divides it from the
parishes of Polmont and Mulravonside; and on the north, it
is bounded by the Frith of Forth, reckoned 4 miles in breadth,
directly opposite to the burgh of Culross.

   Surface, Soil, Rent, Produce.-The parish comprehends
more than 320 English acres, all properly divided and
well inclosed, except about 126 acres in the neighbourhood
of the town, which are let or feued for the conveniency of
the inhabitants.  The surface of the high ground or dry-field,
which may contain 2713 acres, is uneven, rising gradually
from the Frith to the south, and sloping gently on the west,
to the banks of the Avon.  It is let at about 24 s per acre.
The soil is deep and heavy, of a thick, loamy consistence.
About 330 acres of the north-west part of the parish, are
carse ground.  It is of the same nature with the carse of Fal-
kirk, and reckoned rather superior in quality.  Prior to the
year 1750, this land was let at a low rent.  At that period,
a new lease was granted, at 185 4 d per acre.  In the year
