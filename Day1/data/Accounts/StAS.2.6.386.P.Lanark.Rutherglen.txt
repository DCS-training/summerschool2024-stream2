	As there is no enumeration of births, marriages, and deaths, in
this parish, by which the probability of human life can be ascer-
tained with any degree of accuracy, it seems proper to explain the
manner in which bills of mortality have been drawn up in the ad-
joining parishes of Glasgow, where great pains have been bestow-
ed to render them accurate. For want of understanding the prin-
ciples upon which the proper construction of such tables depend,
most of the writers on this subject, many of them men of great
merit and industry, have taken much pains to little purpose, and
after excessive labour, have arrived at false conclusions. Hardly
any of them appear to have been aware of the necessity of ob-
taining the number of the living as well as of the annual deaths
in each interval of age, or that that would greatly enhance the
value of bills of mortality, by extending their useful applications.
	According to Cleland's folio Statistical Tables for Glasgow,
p. 260, it appears that, in the year 1821, the population was 147,043;
deaths, 3686; rate of mortality 1 in 39 89/100 persons.
	In 1831 the population was 202,426; deaths, 5185; rate of
mortality, I in 39 4/100  persons.
	From an official return for the kingdom of the Netherlands.
where the code Napoleon is strictly enforced, the population was
found to be 6,166,854; deaths, 158,800; rate of mortality, I in
38 89/100 persons.
	From the Government parish register abstract, Vol. iii. p. 496,
ordered by the House of Commons to be printed on 2d April 1833,
it appears that, on the average of the metropolis from 1811 to
1821, the rate of mortality was 1 in 39.6 persons. From the
same official document it appears, that, on a similar average, from
1821 to 1831, the rate of mortality was 1 in 39.8 persons.
