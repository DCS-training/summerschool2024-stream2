   Minerals.-There is great appearance of coal in the lands
of Bedrule; and though the proprietor made lately an at-
tempt to discover it, and was, for an individual, at consider-
able expence in the search, and though there were certain-
ly some thin seams found, yet, in the issue, he was not so
successful as his laudable perseverance most justly merited;
not owing, as is still thought, by any means to the uncer-
tainty of the symptoms, but to the great deepness of the main
seam
   Indeed, an attempt of that nature, especially in a district
where coal has not as yet been discovered, certainly ought ra-
ther to be undertaken upon suitable conditions, by a society,
than attempted by an individual, however patriotic or liberal
his spirit, unless his fortune be vast indeed.  Nor at any rate,
ought the experiment to be committed to the management
of obscure or unskilful people, or confined to a short space of
time, or the limits of one estate or parish; but, after most
careful examination, according to the advice of scientific men,
of well known ability and character, the most: likely spot in
a district ought to be pitched upon, and wherever the proba-
ble trial is made, most seriously persevered in.  Such a scheme
would be truly patriotic, and probably, in the issue, become
no less gainful than honourable to the undertakers, and of
unspeakable advantage to the proprietor of the lands where
there happened to be found so great a treasure, and would be
an universal blessing to this otherwise naturally rich and hap-
py country.
