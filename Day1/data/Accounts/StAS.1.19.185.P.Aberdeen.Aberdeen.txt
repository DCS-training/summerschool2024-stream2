     of Aberdeen.

The Old Church was pulled down, and rebuilt, about the
year 1754.-The College Church belonged to the Grey
Friars, and was purchased by the Magistrates from the
College.  There is no account when it was built.
   In the city of Aberdeen are three parochial charges,
and one in the village of Futtie.  There are two charges
in Old Machar.  The exact value of the living is L. 126
Sterling per annum to each parochial minister, without any
manse or glebe.  The patronage is vested in the Magi-
strates and Town-council for the time being.
   The following table contains a list of the ministers of
