     NUMBER XLV.

     PARISH OF PANBRIDE.

     By the Rev. Mr ROBERT TRAIL.

     Name, Situation, Extent, and Surface.

   THERE is reason to believe that this parish was called
Panbridge about 200 years ago, and that it was an
abreviation of Panbridget:  the church here, which is very
old, being built by St Bridget, or at least in honour of her.
An inscription has been seen on an old grave stone, mention-
ing that it was erected in memory of such a person of the
parish of Panbridge.  Pan is probably a corruption of the
Latin word sanum; if so, Panbridge signifies Bridget's church.
This parish is situated in the coutry of Forfar, in the synod
of Angus and Mearns, and in the presbytery of Aberbrothock.
It is more than 5 miles long, and about 2 broad.  It is bound-
ed by the sea on the south; by the parishes of Barrie and Mo-
nikie on the west; by Carmylie on the north; by Arbirlote
on the north-east; and a detached part of St Vigians on the 
south-east.  The general appearance of the country here is
rather flat than hilly; but there is a considerable declivity for
some miles from the north to the south end of this parish.
The shore is flat, and very rocky.
