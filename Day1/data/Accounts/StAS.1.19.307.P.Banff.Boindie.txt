     of Boyndie.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants is 1260; of
which there are 800 nearly in the country parish, and 460
in the sea-town of Whitehills.  The population in 1755, is
stated by Dr Webster at 994 souls.

   Sea-town.-The town of Whitehills is chiefly inhabited
by fishers.  There are seven boats employed in the fishery;
and they are generally very successful.  The kinds of fish
principally caught are cod, ling, and haddocks; and be-
sides considerable quantities sold in the town of Banff, and
in the country around, the fishers generally carry every
year to the Frith of Forth cod and ling to the amount of
L. 500 or L. 600.

   Stipend, etc.-The minister's stipend is, in money, L. 39,
and in victual, 60 bolls.  The collections for the poor
amount to about L. 25 yearly, including the interest of
L. 200 of lent money.  The schoolmaster's salary is only
9 bolls of meal.

   Character of the People.-They are sober, industrious, and
charitable.  From the long leases, and reasonable rents of
the farms in this parish, the people have not that spur to
exertion which racked rents produce for a season.  But
they have every inducement to steady and regular industry,
which improves both their bodies and their minds; and
they are strangers to that despondency, lassitude, and dis-
gust, which, after a few years unavailing exertion, take pos-
session of the dispirited, hard-toiling, and discontented far-
mer, who is oppressed by a rack-rent and short lease, and
at last becomes careless of every thing, when he fees, that
with all his industry, he is unable to pay his landlord and
maintain his family.
