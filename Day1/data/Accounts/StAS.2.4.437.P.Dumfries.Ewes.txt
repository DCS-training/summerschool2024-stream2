		I.,-TOPOGRAAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--This parish was anciently called Ewesdale, which has
now been contracted into Ewes, the names of the river, from the
Celtic Uisge, signifying water.
	Extent, Boundaries.--This pastoral and mountainous parish is
situated in the north-east corner of the country, and is bounded on the
south by Langholm. It extends 8 miles in length, and about 5 1/2
in breath, and contains 24469 Scotch acres,or 34 1/2 square miles.
	Soil, &c.--The appearance of the country on both sides of the
Ewes is hilly; and the hills nearly green, with the exception
of some small pieces covered with heath, which afford both pro-
tection and food for the varios species of game.
	In the low land along the banks of the river, the soil is light and
gravelly; and on the high grounds, it has a tendency to a deep
loam. In favourable seasons, good crops of oats, barley, potatoes,
and turnips are raised on the low ground.
	The climate upon the whole is salubrios, and no epidemic was
ever know to prevail in the parish. The common diseases are,
rheumastism, consumption, and catarrhs, arising from the dampness
of the climate, or the sudden changes from heat to cold.
	Rivers.--The water of Ewes runs through the parish for eight
miles, has its source near Moss Paul, in the northern extremi-
ty of the country, and falls into the Esk at Langholm, two miles
below its southern boundary, dividing it nearly into two parts. In
the east part of the parish, the water of Tarras takes its rise, and,
running almost south-west, fall also into the Esk, about three
miles below the town of Langholm.
	Mineralogy.--The prevailing rocks in this parish belong to the
transition class, and of these the most abundant are greywacke and
greywacke slate. Greenstone also occurs, and on the summits of some
