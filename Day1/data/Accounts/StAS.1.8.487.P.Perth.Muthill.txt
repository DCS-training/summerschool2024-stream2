tions are damp; yet, upon the whole, the people are tolerably
healthy, and live to a good old age.  Many, that are between

very large size, have of late been found in marle pits, on both
sides of the parish, and as the head and horns of the urus,
(the bos ferus of Linnaeus), or mountain bull, were lately
dug up at the side of a small lake, near Drummond Castle, it
