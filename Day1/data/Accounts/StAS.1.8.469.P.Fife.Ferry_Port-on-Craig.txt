     of Ferry-Port-on-Craig.

there.-This Ferry is a custom-house creek, within the pre-
cincts of the custom-house at Dundee.  As it is the lowest
creek in the river, a King's boat, with 6 boatmen, under the
command of a tide surveyor, is stationed here, to board all
vessels coming up the river from a foreign port, for the secu-
rity of the public revenue.  It is also the residence, appointed
for the excise officer of the St. Andrew's second ride, the whole
parish being in that division.
