and susceptible of much improvement at a moderate expence.
Being naturally dry, it suits best with a wet summer; and
would almost require a shower every day.

   Climate.-Of course, it is very well adapted to our climate,
which is rather watery.  As we lie along that line of hills
which reaches the Atlantic on the west, we are exposed to
frequent heavy showers from that quarter; especially when
the wind is westerly, which it generally is for nine months in
the year.  The hills at Greenock attract the clouds that rise
from the Western Ocean.  And, if the wind is high, it con-
veys them along the whole line of hills.  If there is only a
gentle breeze, which veers a little to the N. W. the clouds
follow the line of the Clyde, and leave that of the hills at
Dumbarton or Kilpatrick.  This, of course, is the point to
which the husbandman, in hay time, and harvest, looks with
eager suspence:  And it is a kind of barometer which seldom
fails.  For, if the clouds leave the hills at Kilpatrick, and fol-
low the line of the Clyde, we may rest assured, that we shall
escape the shower; but we can seldom escape, when the clouds
follow the direction of the hills.
   But though the climate is in a certain degree moist, it is far
from being unhealthy.  The air is in general pure and salu-
brious; perhaps more so than either near the east or west coast.
For as we lie at an equal distance from both, we are of course
free from the peculiar inconveniences of either.  We are seldom
visited with the fogs which prevail in the east; and are not
exposed to the almost incessant rains, which predominate in
the west.  The fogs seldom rise so high; and the clouds are
often expended before they reach us.  Hence, in summer and
harvest the sky with us is often clear and serene; when at
Greenock it is cloudy, dark, and lowring, and on the frith of
Forth thick and foggy; as may be seen at a distance from our
