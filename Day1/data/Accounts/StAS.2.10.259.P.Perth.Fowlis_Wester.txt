   Fisheries.-The only fish taken in the parish is in the Almond.
On the cascade at Buchanty, which is divided in its stream, by the
projection of a rock, a basket is suspended, and the salmon and
white trout, in attempting to overleap the cascade, which impedes
their progress up the river, plunge into the basket, and are cap-
tured.

   Manufactures.-The principal manufacture in the parish is the
weaving of cotton cloth, and the weavers are furnished with the raw
material from Glasgow. The construction of sieves, a species of
handicraft, is almost peculiar to this place.  Several families have
been for generations employed in this trade, who carry them to the
Perth and Fife markets, where they meet with a ready sale, at re-
munerating prices.

                  V.- PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   The town and lands of Lacock adjoining to Fowlis, are a burgh
of barony, with the privilege of a weekly market every Wednesday,
and two yearly fairs; but none of these have been held of late.
Crieff, which is five miles distant, is the nearest market-town.
   Villages.-There are two villages in the parish, Gilmerton and
Fowlis.  The former is neat and well built, in a pleasant situation,
tbrough which the turnpike road passes from Perth to Crieff.  The
latter generally is in the state in which it has been for centuries, and
in its exterior appearance is a monument of the building of olden
times. The progress of improvement, however, has commenced.
Several of the houses have been lately slated, and the inn has been
rebuilt, in a substantial and commodious manner, which, with the
school-house, is an ornament to the village.
   The parish enjoys the means of communication in all directions,
by the excellent turnpike roads which have been formed.  The
