rit of revealed truth, might build up, in harmonious combination
with intellectual excellence, the living temple of a moral and reli-
gious, and therefore truly noble and manly, character.  The de-
scriptions of processes of art and manufacture, the superficial state-
ments of the naked results of scientific inquiry, and the many
other articles of a like flimsy and purely mechanical character,
with which our school-books now abound, would seem to have
been drawn up almost for the express purpose of communicating
that smattering of knowledge which is ever the ready minister of
pride and vain-glory.  We would not, indeed, have the knowledge
which these articles convey left untaught, but we would have it
taught in such a manner, as, by connecting it with the well-head
or fountain whence it originally sprung,-with the many years of
patient and persevering toil of which it was the reward,-and with
the views which it unfolds, alike of creative wisdom and goodness,
and of a constantly superintending and sustaining Providence,-
should impress the mind of the pupil with a deep sense of his own
ignorance and nothingness, and lead him to discern, both in the
constitution of nature itself, and in the discoveries of that consti-
tution vouchsafed to man, the gracious interpositions of an ever-
present Deity.  How often, again, are the short historical and
biographical articles, which appear in our school-books, of a cha-
racter as remote as possible from harmonizing with the spirit and
principles of Divine truth, and how powerfully must they tend,
therefore, in the case of the young, to weaken the force of religi-
ous impressions, and to give to the inexperienced mind the direc-
tion and bent of a practical infidelity!  Yet the events of history
are many, and strikingly impressive, from which, without incurring
any danger of judging presumptuously of the workings of Provi-
dence in human affairs, a master mind in literature, which should
be also thoroughly imbued with the sound principles of a living
Christian philosophy, might extract lessons for the young of the
highest practical religious importance; and the altogether pre-
eminent services, which, under the like auspices, might be render-
ed to the cause of education, by the still more productive field
of biography, must forcibly present themselves to every re-
flecting mind.  What examples of the purest and most disinte-
rested patriotism, of the loftiest moral bearing, and of the most
imposing attainments in the walks of literature and science, might
be furnished by the annals even of our own country, illustrated
and infinitely enhanced in value, by being found in conjunction
