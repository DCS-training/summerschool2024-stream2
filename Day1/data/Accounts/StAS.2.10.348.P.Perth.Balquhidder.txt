  Braes district, to the west of the church, where there were 50 te-
  nants, with a cottar perhaps under every tenant, there are at pre-
  sent only 3 tenants and 1 cottar; so that now the greater part of
  the population is in the Lochearnbead, or the north-east district,
  and in Strathyre the south-east district.  The church was built in
  the year 1631, and has been repaired several times since; it may
  contain about 600, and the seats are all free.  The manse was
  built in the year 1774, and was repaired about twelve years ago.
  There are no Dissenters in the parish.  Divine service is generally
  well attended in the summer season.
    Education.-There are three schools in the parish.  In the
  parochial school are taught, Latin, writing, arithmetic, reading,
  English and Gaelie.  In Strathyre district, there is a school sup-
  ported by the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Know-
  ledge, in which are taught English, writing, arithmetic, and Gae-
  lic.  There is another school, established at Lochearnhead, and
  supported by the General Assembly's Committee; the branches
  of education taught in it are Latin, writing, arithmetic, English,
  and Gaelic.  In all these schools, strict attention is paid to the
  morals of the youth, and to their religious instruction.  The pa-
  rochial schoolmaster's salary is the maximum, and the school fees
  may amount to L. 10 a year.  He has not a garden, but has the
  fiars price of 2 bells oat-ineal in lieu thereof.  There are none in
  the parish between six and fifteen years of age who are not taught
  to read, and the people in general are alive to the benefits of edu-
  cation.
