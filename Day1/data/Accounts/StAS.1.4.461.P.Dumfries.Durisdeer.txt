Scots, 3 chalders of victual, 1/2 meal, the other bear, L. 40
Scots for communion-elements, and 21 acres of a glebe.
The Duke of Queensberry is patron.  The manse was
built in 1763.  The church was repaired in 1785.-There
is one school with a salary of L. 100 Scots, but no school-
house nor dwelling-house.  There is another school for
teaching English, writing, and arithmetic, to which Mr
thomas Tod, once minister of this parish, mortified 1000
merks Scots; the interest of this sum, and L. 14 Sterling
that had been saved during vacancies, make the whole of
the salary.  The kirk-session elect the teacher, according to

at the parish school.-On the poor's roll there are generally
between 25 and 30 persons.  Besides occasional assistance is
given to families in distress.  Few of the poor beg except
withib the bounds of the parish.  The poor are provided for
by the Sunday collections, by the interest of 1000 merks 
Scots, mortified by the late Mr Tod, and by L. 11: 1: 5
Sterling, mortified by General Douglas, long paid on that
footing; but the bond being amissing, it has, for some time
past, been paid as an allowance, from the Duke of Queens-
berry, together with 25 stone of meal yearly.  Besides,
there is L. 106,12 s. at 4 per cent. interest.  So that the funds
for the support of the poor amount to about L. 40 a-year, ex-
clusive of occasional legacies.
