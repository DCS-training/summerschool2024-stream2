     Statistical Account

   Manufactures.-The thread and linen manufactures were
carried on here, a few years ago, to a very great extent.
   For the thread manufacture alone 3500 mats of Dutch
flax were annually imported; which, at an average of L. 3,
5 s. each, cost upwards of L. 11,000 Sterling.  The opera-
tion of milling and heckling employed about 60 men.
When given out to spin, it afforded employment for 4000
individuals; yielded 150,000 spindles of yarn, which cir-
culated about L. 10,000 among the spinners.  The doubling
and twisting the yarn, which was done in Banff, employed
about 200 women and children, and at the bleachfield,
engaged the labour and attention of 40 people more.  These
threads, when sent to Nottingham or Leicester, were valued
at L. 30,000 Sterling.
   This productive and useful branch has since given place
to the stocking manufacture, which is also conducted on a
very extensive scale by Messrs Robinsons.
   They have 150 of these frames, for the manufacturing
of silk, cotton, and worsted stockings.  From the nature of
the work, and the advanced state of the mechanical arts,
which has necessarily abridged human labour, this manu-
facture does not offer employment to such numbers as the
branch formerly mentioned.  In the several departments of
the work, however, about 560 persons of different descrip-
tions are constantly engaged.

<FOOTNOTE>

It is a curious circumstance, and perhaps but little known, that the chief
consumption of pickled salmon, when first in season, and when prices are
high, is by the lowest classes of the people in London.  The middle ranks,
and those immediately above them, abstain generally from such indulgen-
ces until the prices are moderate.  See an admirable treatise on the Police
of the Metropolis, by P. Colquhoun, Esq; L. L. D. late Provost of Glas-
gow, and now one of the Magistrates of the Police for London.
