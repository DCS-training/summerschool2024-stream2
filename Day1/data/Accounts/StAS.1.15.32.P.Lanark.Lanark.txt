     Statistical account

   Anno 1297, the same author adds, that Sir William
Wallace began here his first great military exploit by
defeating the English sherriff of Lanarkshire, William de
Hesliope, and putting him to death in this town.  Blind
Harry relates this event at greater length, affixing the
same date to it.  He tells us Wallace having married a
lady of the name of Braidfoot, the heiress of Lammington,
lived with her privately at Lanark; that while there,
a scuffle ensued in the street between Wallace and a few
friends, and a body of Englishmen.  Wallace being over-
powered, fled first to his own house and from thence made
his escape to Cartlane Craigs.  The sherriff Hesilrig, or
as Fordun calls him Hesliope, seized upon his wife and
put her to death.  To revenge which, Wallace gathers
a few friends together, attacks Hesilrig in the night, and
kills him and 240 Englishmen.  Tradition tells us, that
the house where Wallace resided was at the head of the
Castlegate opposite the church, where a new house has
lately been erected.  It also acquaints us that a private
vaulted archway led from this house to Cartlane Craigs,
but seemingly without the smallest probability.
   Anno 1310 Bruce, finally recovered Lanark from the
English.
   By act of parliament 20 June 1617, anent weights and
measures, the care of the weights was committed to the
burgh of Lanark; "In respect that the keeping and out-
giving of the weights of old to the burrows and others,
etc. was committed to the burgh of Lanark."  Standard
weights were transmitted to Lanark from London at the
union, but whether they exist at present or not is un-
known*.
