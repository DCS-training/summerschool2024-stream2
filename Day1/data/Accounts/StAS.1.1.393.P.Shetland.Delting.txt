     of Delting.

   The parish abounds in horses, horned cattle, and sheep:
The pastures might no doubt bear a much greater number 
of each than they now contain.  There is no saying, with
minute exactness, what may be the number of each.  If
the sheep are stated at 8000, it will not be materially under
or above the truth.  There may be about 700 milch cows,
besides oxen and young cattle.  What the number of horses
may be it is impossible to say; but there is certainly a great
number:  They are very small; and, owing to the little at-
tention paid to the selection of proper stallions, they are be-
coming smaller every year.

   The winter of 1784 was very severe, and cut off a great num-
ber of sheep and horned cattle in every part of these islands.
An account was taken, at the desire of the minister, in this pa-
rish, and the return was 4506 sheep*, and 427 black cattle,
dead in the course of the winter, besides horses, of which no
accurate account could be obtained.  This, joined to a year
of as great scarcity as the country had ever experienced, was
very hard on the poor tenants; and they have not yet reco-
vered the loss.  In that winter, the sheep were often dug out
of the snow, after continuing under it for 20 days; during
all which time they had no food, but eat the wool from the
backs of each other.  Some that died after they were taken
out were opened, and a hard ball of wool was found in their
stomach.  The general poverty of the inhabitants; their being
obliged to be from home during the fishing season; the small-
ness of their farms, and the precarious tenure by which they
hold them; all conspire to keep them in a state of indigence.

*This was the number of dead sheep that were found; many
perished whose carcases were never found.
