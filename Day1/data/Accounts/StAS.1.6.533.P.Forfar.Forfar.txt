   From the preceding statement of the population, it would
appear that Forfar ought to be a collegiate charge.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The poor in the country pa-
rish are few, only about 8 to 10 very old or diseased indivi-
duals claim the aid of the funds, and they are well supplied at
their houses out of the weekly collections at the church, and
the interest of accumulated collections in former years of
plenty.-They have a few acres  of land, purchased by
such contributions, as a reserve against years of scarcity.  All
the above amount to more than L. 40 sterling.  There is not
a beggar in the country parish, and only about five of six be-
longing to the town, who are furnished by the kirk treasurer
with a permission-ticket, to distinguish them from strangers
and vagrants.
   About half a century ago the population of the town and
country parish seems to have been nearly equal, the dispropor-
tion between them now will appear from the foregoing table.
-There has been little alteration in the number of landward
parishioners since the year 1781, though during that period

the small-pox.
