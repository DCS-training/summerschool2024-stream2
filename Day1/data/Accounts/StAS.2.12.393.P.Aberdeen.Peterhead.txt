the same time, it will exhibit, in a condensed form, and of easy re-
ference, much of the information contained in this account.
   Population.-In Dr Moir's time, the population in the town
amounted to 2550, and in the landward part of the parish to 1141;
total 3691.  By the census of 1831, the population in the town
amounted to 5112, and in the landward part of the parish to 1583;
total 6695.  To which add the estimated number of seamen, 1000,
and the probable increase since that time 315, which gives as the
present population 8000.
   In Boddam, separately, there were 192 inhabitants; houses and
families, 49.  The population of Boddam is now 460 ; houses and
families, 99.
   The average number of births per annum was 105 ; it is now
270.
   The average number of deaths was 68; it is now 144.
   The average number of marriages was 28; it is now 51.
   Agriculture.-The extent of the parish is stated by Dr Moir
to be 7000 Scots acres, of which there were under cultivation
5000.  It has been ascertained that there are 7087 Scots acres,
or nearly so, in the parish, of which there are now cultivated 6505
Scots acres, = 8266 imperial acres.
   Turnips and grass were only partially cultivated. Turnips and
grass now form an essential part of the rotations of cropping fol-
lowed here, and are very extensively cultivated.
   The arable land was interspersed with bawks or patches between
the ridges of waste and uncultivated land.  The bawks have now
been cultivated, the land drained and partly enclosed, and laid ofF
in regular fields to answer the rotations agreed upon.
   The implements of husbandry were in general very inferior.
The ploughs formerly in use here, called Scotch ploughs, were,
according to Dr Moir, often drawn by two horses with a cow or-
young steer.  "I have even seen," he says, "a plough with one
horse, a cow, and a young steer."  The implements of husbandry
are now greatly improved in their construction and increased in
numbers embracing all those which have been found useful in other
districts of the country.
   There were no thrashing-machines, and but few fanners.  There
is now no farm of any importance to which there is not attached
a thrashing-machine; and fanners are possessed by the crofters.
   The average rent in the country part of the parish was 12s. per
acre.  Near the town it was from L.1, 10s. to L.4, 4s.  The
