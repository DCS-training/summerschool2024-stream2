live to a very advanced age.  Within these 40 years, several
have died considerably above 80.  During this period, a man
died at 91, and a woman at the very great age of 104.  There
are now living 2 men of 85, one of 91, and not a few per-
sons, of both sexes, between 70 and 82.

   Small Pox.-This disease, it must be acknowledged, is a
melancholy exception to these facts.  It rages here, at times,
with the utmost violence, and is often extremely fatal.  In
the summer and autumn of 1791, upwards of 90 children
had the natural small pox, and more than one half of them
died.  The chin-cough and natural small pox not unfrequent-
ly prevail at the same time.  When this happens, as was the
case at the above period, the ravages committed by this last
disease, are truly dreadful.  The coincidence of these diseases
might, in a great measure, be prevented by inoculation.  But
though in this, and in every other respect, inoculation is at-
tended with the happiest consequences, it is only practised
here in two or three families.  From ignorance, and the
most supertitious prejudices, the parents, regardless, or in-
sensible of consequences, instead of inoculating their children,
Crowd into those houses in which the disease is of the most
malignant nature, and at a time when it is the most infectious.
The very worst kind of this dangerous and Poathsome disease
is, in this manner, communicated and spread, and thousands
of valuable lives are lost to the community.  This impious
presumption, these illiberal and groundless prejudices, are not
peculiar to this parish; in every other country parish in Scot-
land, the great bulk of the people think and act pretty much
in the same way.  It is well known, at least to the clergy,
that every argument in support of inoculation, however con-
clusive or self-evident, makes no impression upon their minds.
