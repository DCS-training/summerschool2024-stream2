the census taken this year, (1841,) there were 35 inhabited
houses, occupied by about 35 families: and there were 119 males
and 113 females,-in all 232.  A number of years ago, a few families
removed to Orkney,-the island being rather overstocked with
inhabitants.  There are 96 merks of land in the island, besides a
few outsets not long occupied.  The people bad found the prose-
cution of the ling and tusk-fishing at a distance from the land, not
profitable; and they now confine themselves to the catching of
seath, that being not so dangerous and expensive an operation as
the former.  Of this about forty tons, in the dried state, have been
generally transported to the Leith market; which, during the ex-
istence of the Government bounty, together with the oil produced,
brought a good return.  No fish is disposed of to straggling ves-
sels that may appear on the coast, the fishermen being bound to
deliver their products to the tacksmatan.  What feu-duty is now
paid from the island to Lord Dundas I am not aware; but, instead
of L. 34 Scotch, formerly paid to the minister as teinds, L.14,
Os. 1Od. Sterling has been awarded by decreet of, the Court, as his
proportion of L.200, the stipend of the ministry at present.  There
remain some unexbausted teinds, which will raise the stipend
to nearly L.300 per annum, when a fresh augmentation shall take
place.
   The number of boats has considerably increased since the time
of the last Statistical Account ; and they all lie on the south side
of the island, in a creek, where a good many of the cod-fishing
sloops belonging to the mainland take shelter, when the weather is
unfavourable.
   The people are sober and industrious; and most vigorous
and expert rowers.  The Society for Propagating Christian Know-
ledge has granted a salary to a schoolmaster for his exertions, in
conducting the Sabbath evening school in this island.
