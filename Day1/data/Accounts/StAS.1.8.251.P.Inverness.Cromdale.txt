     of Cromdale.

     NUMBER XII.

     PARISH OF CROMDALE.

     (Counties of Moray and Inverness.-Presbytery of Aber-
      nethy-Synod of Moray.)

     By the Rev. Mr. LEWIS GRANT.

     Origin of the Name.

   CROMDALE is derived from the Gaelic language, Crom
signifying crooked, and dale a meadow; which is liter-
ally explained by the river Spey, making a semi-circle, or
half moon, in the place where the manse and church are built.
Cromdale has been rendered pretty famous all over Scotland,
by the song composed in consequence of a battle fought there,
in the year 1690, betwixt the adherents of King William,
commanded by Colonel Livingston, and the supporters of the
house of Stuart, headed by Clarets, commonly called Lord
Viscount Dundee; and wherein King William's party pre-
vailed, killing and taking prisoners great numbers of the
enemy.  This action is laid to have put a stop to any farther
bloodshed on that score.
