     Marischal College and University of Aberdeen.

"anie free College within this realme be law and practicke
"is knawin to appertene, etc. etc."  Another Act of Parlia-
ment, passed after the Restoration, in 1661, confirms the
foundation and privileges of the New University, almost in
the same words.

   Other Professorships founded.-In consequence of the provi-
sion made for that purpose by the original charter, several
new professorships were afterwards added, viz. a fourth re-
gent, who, by the commission of Parliament in 1700, for vi-
siting schools and colleges, was appointed to be fixed profes-
sor of Greek.  A professorship of mathematics was founded
in 1613, by Dr Duncan Liddell, a native of Aberdeen, and
eminent scholar, who had been professor of medicine and ma-
thematics in the University of Helmstadt.  A professorship
of divinity, founded in 1616, by Mr Patrick Copland, minis-
ter of Norton, in Northamptonshire.  A professorship in me-
dicine, by the Earl Marischal, in 1700.  A professorship of
oriental languages, by Mr Gilbert Ramsay, rector of Christ
Church, in the island of Barbadoes, in 1723.  And lately in
1793, a professorship in chemistry, by Mrs Blackwell, widow
of Dr Thomas Blackwell, formerly principal of the University.
   A few years since, Sir William Fordyce, physician in Lon-
don, also endowed a lectureship on subjects tending to im-
prove the agriculture and manufacturer of Scotland; but
the salary being liferented by one of his relations, it has not
as yet been carried into effect.  The beforementioned Mrs
Blackwell also appointed a premium of 10 l. sterling, to be
annually bestowed on the person who should compose and
deliver, in the English language, the best discourse upon a
given literary subject; the first five being prescribed by her-
self, and the succeeding ones to be proposed by the Universi-
ty.  This has accordingly taken place for these two years,
