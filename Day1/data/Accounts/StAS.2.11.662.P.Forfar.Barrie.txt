month is 5s. The church collections have been gradually dimi-
nishing for many years. The refusal of the heritors to enlarge the
church some seven or eight years ago, induced many of the people to
withhold their weekly contributions, and eventually led in 1837-8 to
the erection of the quoad sacra church of Carnoustie by voluntary
subscription. The opening of this church, situated as it is in the
lort populous part of the parish, necessarily caused a still farther
diminution, so that, in 1839, the whole amount of church-door
collections was only L. 28, 11s. 8 1/2d.; in 1840, L. 28, 7s. 10 1/2d.;
and in 1841, L. 26, 3s. 9 1/2d.
	From circumstances unnecessary to be here noticed, the amount
of the church-door collections now rarely reaches the sum of 3s.
There has been hitherto no legal assessment. The heritors vo-
luntarily contributed in 1839, L. 75, 6s.; in 1840, L. 47, 8s;
and in 1841, L. 39, 14s. Oftener than once, a contribution has
been received from the congregation of the quoad sacra church of
Carnoustie, and in addition to what they have contributed to the
poor's fund, they have occationally made special collections, and
distributed them amongst the poor in their district.
