                   MONKTON AND PRESTWICK.                          175

rish, which are either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, is about
1800. The number never cultivated, or remaining constantly
waste or in pasture is 570. There is little of these 570 acres that
could, with advantage, be added to the cultivated land of the pa-
rish. The only common in the parish is that of Prestwick, which
was some years ago divided and appropriated. The number of
acres under wood is about 50, mostly planted.
     Rent of Land.--The average rent of land in the Monkton half
of the parish, including 170 acres of sand-bluffs and links on the
sea side, is L. 2, 6s. per Scotch acre; and over the united parish
L. 1, 17s. 3d. per acre. The average rent of summer grazing may
be stated at L. 4, 10s. for an ox or milch cow; and L. 21 10s. for
young cattle.
	Husbandry.--The state of husbandry in the parish may be said
to be in a very advanced stage of improvement. Surface-draining
in every alternate furrow, with tiles and stones, has been adopted
with the best effects in some of the best land in the parish. The
leases are generally of nineteen years.
   	The farm-steadings are generally good, and upon some of the
larger farms have been crected in a very complete style, and at
great expense.
   	Surface draining, and feeding off the turnip crop on the ground
with sheep, appear to be the most important improvements lately
introduced into the husbandry of the parish.
   	Produce.--The average gross amount of raw produce raised in
the parish has been ascertained with a considerable attention to
minuteness and accuracy, and is as follows, viz.

	 Produce of grain of all kinds, whether for food of man or domestic animals
