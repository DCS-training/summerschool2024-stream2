and black cattle in it, could answer little purpose, when it can be
asserted as a fact, that not above one third, of the foals or calves,
is reared and brought up in the parish, that are necessary for the
culture of the soil.  Grass is one of the principal wants we have
to complain of.  The arable soil is so precious, that the far-
mer thinks, he could not bear turning any part of it into grass.
The want of inclosures and winter herding, precludes him
from the advantages of green crops, The best grass farm in
the parish lies on the north coast, about an English mile from
Dungisbay Head, It is sufficient for the support of 30 cows,
better, which, for colour and quality, is deservedly
held in the highest estimation.

   Sheep.-It is not believed, that the whole sheep in the pa-
rish at present exceed 2000.  Foxes, dogs, bad seasons, and,
above all, the inattention of the owners, are the causes of the
diminution of their number, to a third part of what they for-
merly were.  I hey are far from being of a very good quality,
either for wool or mutton; nor has any attempt been made to
meliorate the breed.  The parish in general is not naturally
possessed of pasturage favourable for the rearing of sheep.
There is one place in it, however, that seems to recommend
itself for the pasturage of sheep, and for nothing else.-This
is Dungisbay Head and its environs, which might be adequate
to the support of 600 or 700 sheep.  The Head itself is every
where covered with green to the very brink of the sur-
rounding rock, with an intermixture of short young heath.
The situation is dry and the air wholesome.  The Head com-
municates with the Warth Hill, which would relieve the pas-
turage occasionally.  Upon the whole, it is hardly to be
doubled, that sheep would prosper on this pasture, if duly at-
tended to; and it were greatly to be wished, that the pro-
prietor or possessor would make the experiment.
