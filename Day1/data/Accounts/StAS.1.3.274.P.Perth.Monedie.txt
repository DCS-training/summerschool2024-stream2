     Statistical Account

the conversion of some small teinds, and the glebe, consist-
ing of 6 1/2 acres, makes the whole of the stipend amount, in
ordinary years, to L. 80, and in extraordinary years, it does
not exceed L. 90.  The manse is a very old house, and has
been fredquently repaired at a great expence.  The offices
were, within these two years, renewed, but upon too small
a scale.  The kirk also, is an old building.  It got some re-
pairs a good number of years ago; but it is, at present, in a
very miserable and poor condition, and too small for the
congregation.

   School, etc.-The shoolmaster is well lodged, in a house
lately built of mason work.  He occupies the upper story
with a garret; the ground story is the school.  His salary is
100 merks Scots, which, with the other emoluments, a-
mount only to about L. 20.

   Fuel.-Till within these two or three years, the principal
fuel of the common people was turf, but, as they are now
prohibited from paring the ground, they use coals; which
are brought from Fife to Perth, where they are sold for
about 3s. of 4s. the boll, (40 stones to the boll), and the
people find them cheaper, and more comfortable than turf.
There is no peat moss in the parish.

   Antiquities.-There are many circles of stones, supposed to
be Druidical temples.  There are several vestiges of ancient
battles, distinguished by cairns of stones, with a large stone
placed erect, and another large one, lying length-ways, at its
foot.  There is the pretorium of a Roman camp, according
to the opinion of an officer, an antiquary, who carefully
viewed the spot.  There is also a vault, the only remains of a
palaced belonging to the bishop of Dunkeld.  There is no date
