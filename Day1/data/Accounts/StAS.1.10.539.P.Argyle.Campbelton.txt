supposed to have reference to the time of the kings, are the
immense barrows, and the rude pillars which mark the
scenes of battles, and cover the dust of the slain.  These are
so numerous throughout the country, that it is unnecessary
to particularise any of them.  The greatest number of them,
however, is to be found about the head of Loch-Crinan*,
where probably the families of Kintyre and Lorn often
met each other, (being nearly mid-way from their respec-
tive residences,) to fight their battles.  And yet, from the
appearance of such of them as have been opened or removed,
(which were found to contain half burnt bones and ashes,
sometimes in rude earthen urns, and sometimes in square
stone coffins;) it should seem, that they had been raised be-
fore the introduction of Christianity; as burning the dead has
not been practised since that period, nor was it probably the
custom for a long time before it, at least by the natives+.
Under the obelisks, or pillars, the same contents are sound,
as under the cairns or barrows.
   A great number of forts, supposed to be Danish are to be
seen along the sea-coast of Kintyre; and there is also a vitri-
fied tower; but, being beyond the bounds of this parish, it
is foreign to the limits of this work.  Of the houses, built
with lime in this country, none can be supposed to be inte-
rior to the 12th century.  The little castles of this kinds
within the dominions of the Lords of Kintyre, and of the isles,
were, for the greater part, of a still later date.  The best and
oldest of their buildings, in this country, was the abbey of

*This bay may have had its name from CRINAN, the war-
like Abbot of Dunkeld, (and father of a race of Kings,) who
fell in battle in 1045.
+The Danes may have burned their dead, in their incursions
into there parts in later times.  But there monuments are found
often in the inland parts, to which the Danes never penetrated.
