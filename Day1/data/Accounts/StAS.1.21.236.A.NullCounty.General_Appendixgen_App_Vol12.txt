     Parish of Glenmuick.

   Additional Communications, from the Rev. George Brown.

   There is a strange inaccuracy concerning the poors' funds
in the printed report of these parishes.  The written report
stated, that, besides 169 L. sterling, settled in a gentleman's
hands for the behoof of the poor, a Mrs Elizabeth Farquhar-
son of Jamaica, a native of the parish, left at her death 400 L.
sterling to these parishes; 200 L. were to be settled for the
poor, the interest of which they were to draw yearly: and
the other 200 L. were to be settled likewise, and the in-
terest of them to be given as a salary to a schoolmaster yearly,
to teach the poor children in these parishes, for ever.  But
the trustees, appointed by Mrs Farquharson to manage this
part of her will, took no concern with it for upwards of 20
years after her death.  At last, however, one of them, by
means of his son, then in the island, recovered the original
400 L. with 200 L. of interest; which made 300 L. to the poor,
and 300 L. to the school.  When the report was sent up,
none of the money was applied to the purposes for which it
was intended.  But the poor now draw 14 L. yearly as the in-
terest of their 300 L.; though no step has hitherto been taken
to establish the school.-I shall put down all the money be-
longing to the poor separately as they receive it.
