rowan sticking out, as if dropt, by accident, from a rock, de-
serves the name; where not a flower, but that of whins,
where the soil is dry, is to be found; and which Ramsay,
from having no apparent connection with it, or its neigh-
bourhood, in all probability never saw, or even heard of, in

intimate friends of Sir James Clark at Pennycuick, the Duke
and Dutchess of Queensberry, his cousin, President Forbes,
was the chief support of Thomson, who might often have
been here along with him, and was also distinguished for the
accuracy and engaging simplicity, as well as richness, of his
descriptions of rural life and scenery.
   These properties, on the death of Mr Forbes, were disjoin-
ed, but are now again united; the farthest of the glens be-
hind has been flooded from the Harbour Craig upward,
