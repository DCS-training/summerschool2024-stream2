be now added as will make the number 1700.  From the
register of baptisms about the time of the Revolution op-
posing the proportion between the baptisms and on 
the same then as at present, the number of inha ap-
pears to have been at that time 1460; so that, in
of a hundred years, the population has increased 
that is, by about the number of persons employed
bleachfields and paper mill.  That it has not increased more
is owing to the conjunction of small farms, and the
tion of cottages. The number of males is to that of fe
males nearly as 10 to 9.  The average number of marriages
for the last 10 years is 16, of baptisms for the same
and of burials for the last 9 years 28.  The rule
finding the population of a district, by multiplying 
by 26, or the deaths by 36, seems not to be well-

   Canal, etc.-The great canal between Forth and Clyde
passes through the south part of the parish.  It is
over the river Kelvin by a stately aqueduct bridge, planned by
Mr Whitworth, and executed by Mr Gibb.  The foundation
of the bridge was laid June 15, 1787, and it was finished
June 1790.  The length is 350 feet, the breadth
which the canal occupies 27 1/2, and the height, from
face, of the river to the top of the parapet wall, 57.
upon 4 arches; each 50 feet wide, and 37  high.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-From the preceding ac-
count, it appears that this parish enjoys considerable advan-
tages: Abundance of coal and lime within itself and
had easily from other places too, by means of the canoe its
vicinity to Glasgow; distant only about six miles from the
middle of the parish, where there is a ready market in all
kinds of product; plenty of stone for building; and
