many years, in order to recruit its prolific powers.  Even
this cessation from tillage was not followed with any material
advantage.  Artificial grasses were yet unknown; and the
ground, thus reduced, derived but little nourishement from
the natural and scanty productions of the soil.  These mis-
takes, however, have been discovered, and their effects have
now, in a good measure, ceased.  The necessity of following
marl with dung is admitted on all hands, and the introduc-
tion of artificial grasses into the system of cropping univer-
sally adopted.
   But though this, practice has been followed with very be-
neficial consequences, there is yet much room for further im-
provement.  Perhaps the rotation of crops is not the best
that might be devised, and the proportion of green crop to
that of grain is still too small.  No uniform rotation is adop-
ted in the parish, nor is it always invariable on the same
farm.  Where any thing like a system is pursued, the fol-
lowing is the most general: Oats, barley, oats, green crop,
or fallow; oats, barley with grass seeds.  Probably oats,
green crop, barley with grass seeds, would be a better rota-
tion.  The green crop in this parish consists of potatoes,
turnips, pease, lint, nearly in equal proportions.  There has
been no wheat sown in this parish till within these few years,
nor is it yet cultivated to any extent, though the soil is by
no means unfavourable to it.  This is partly owing to the
influence of custom, and the size of the farms.  A great part
of the parish is divided into small farms of about six, eight,
or ten acres.  These are generally occupied by tradesmen,
whose ideas are not sufficiently enlarged for following the most
approved modes of husbandry, and who consider their farms
rather as a matter of convenience, than of profit.  But if this
circumstance is less favourable to agricultural improvements;
