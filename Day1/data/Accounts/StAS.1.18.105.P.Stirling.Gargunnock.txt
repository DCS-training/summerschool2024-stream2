the best in quality.  In a dry spring season, after an open
winter, the clod is so hard, that there is great labour and fa-
tigue before the harrows can make any impression.  A good
deal of frost in winter, and occasional showers in spring, are
favourable to the carse; but, if there has been little frost, or,
if there is great drought after it is ploughed, the clay becomes
impenetrable as the rock, and it is not without much toil
that the seed is covered.  The nearer the banks of the Forth,
the land becomes so much the more pliable.  The clay mixt
with gravel and sand, form those rich flat fields on the sides
of the river, which are in high repute both for corn and
pasture.

   Farming.-The method of farming now generally observed,
proves its superiority by its effects, while new attempts are
made from year to year, by those of spirit and enterprize in
the way of farther improvement.  The use of lime to the
amount of 8 chalders per acre in the carse, and 5 in the dry-
fields, and the system of having a regular rotation of crops in
every field, are the chief circumstances which have produced
the very material difference betwixt the present and the for-
mer quantity of grain in the parish.  It is no unusual thing
now to find 10 bolls of wheat or barley upon an acre, which
once produced almost nothing but thistles.  The carse is sown
with wheat, beans, barley, and grass seeds, and after hay has
been cut for two years, the field is next in oats, but in some
places pasturing is preferred, as it contributes much to
enrich the ground.
   The late Mr Graham of Micklewood, who had a thorough
knowledge of farming, and who pointed out the way to the im-
provement of the carse, scrupulously observed the following
rotation of crops, as what he judged the best, and expressly
appointed a particular farm to be so cultivated in all time
