these inclosures; and salmon, in small quantities, during the
spring and summer months.  Along the Cardross shore there
are many such inclosures, but those most happily situated are
the properties of Mr Dennistoun of Colgram, and Mr Noble
of Noble-Farm.  The rights to these yare fishings prove them
to be of very high antiquity, being granted by crown char-
ters above 500 years ago, and confirmed by all subsequent
charters.  By these, the proprietors of the soil have the right
of exercising yare fishings upon the shore to low water-mark.
Some of these rights extend as far as a man can ride beyond
low water, and from that throw a twelve-feet spear.  This
extent of shore, during the herring season, is attentively
guarded, that the fish which may entrap themselves in
these yares, may neither be alarmed by, nor taken in the nets
of the boat-fishers.-It is remarked, from the earliest ac-
counts of this kind of fishing, that the herrings visit the
river Clyde, at nearly 3 equal periods in 100 years, each pe-
riod consisting of several years fishing.  The mode of secu-
ring what fish may be in the yares, is with a hand-net.  By
ancient custom, two thirds belong to the yare proprietor, and
one third to the fisher, if a tenant upon the adjoining lands.
But when strangers are permitted to fish they have only one
fourth part of their success allowed them.

   Church, etc.-The church of Cardross originally stood in
the eastern extremity of the parish, opposite to Dumbarton,
and separated from it by the river Leven.  This situation
must have been very inconvenient to the parish, and there-
fore, in 1643, a new church was built in the place where it
now stands, the most centrical, indeed, that could have been
chosen, and the most convenient to the parish at large.  The
church is a neat building, well lighted and well seated.  It
underwent a complete repair in 1775, and, by the care and
