   Manufactures.-Small spots of lint are to be seen on every
farm.  Most of the inhabitants rear sheep, for their wool.
They manufacture both the wool and the lint for their own
use, or for home sale; but neither in sufficient quantity for their
own consumpt.  A great deal of English cloth is every Sun-
day seen at church.  The only article in this and the neigh-
bouring parishes, that can be called a manufactures is distilling
of aquavitae.  There are 9 licenced stills in the parish, at 30
gallons each.  Highlanders from Lochaber, the extensive
west coast of Ross-shire, and the Isle of Sky, buy the spirits
at between 10 s. and 14 s. per Scotch gallon.  One man only
in the parish occupies a still without partners.  From 5 to
10 or 12 tenants join about one of there stills, by which
means each has an opportunity of manufacturing his own
growth of barley; and where that falls short of making up
his proportion, he buys from his neighbours.  The whole
barley in the parish is distilled.  Though no feed is left for
the ensuing season, yet the whole growth is not equal to the
quantity manufactured into spirits by 9 stills.  They say,
that no barley answers so well as the growth of the parish,
which they attribute to the warmth and dryness of the soil.
The barley crop is generally allotted for paying the rents.
The principal or only profit resulting from the distillery is
keeping up the price of grain, and converting it speedily in-
to money.  The profits otherwise are next to nothing, ex-
cept the drass or grains.  The only other resource they have
is from black cattle; but grass being scanty, the increase of
cattle seems hardly sufficient to supply the waste of horses,
few of which are reared in the parish.

   Church, School, and Poor.-The church was built about 12
years ago.  It cost 900 L. Sterling, and was then the most
elegant and substantial building of the kind in the county.
