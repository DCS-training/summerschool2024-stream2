      Harvest.-Hay-cutting commences in ordinary seasons about
   the 20th June, and continues throughout July. The other crops
   are usually reaped in the lower section of the parish between the
   middle or end of August, and the beginning of October ; in the
   upper section a fortnight or three weeks later.
      Leases.-The general duration of leases is nineteen years, which
   is reckoned favourable, but no boon, to the occupier. As rents  
   are now generally covenanted for partly in money and partly in
   grain, in as nearly equal proportions as possible, regulated by the
   fiars of the county, oil an average of three years, it is of less im-
   portance to a landlord how long a lease may last.
      Farm-Buildings and Enclosures.-Farm-buildings are much
   improved, and, for the most part, executed in a substantial man-
   ner.  The lands are almost all enclosed, partly with free, or some-
   times whinstone dikes, and these often dry, and partly with ditches
   and hedges.
      Manufactures.-The staple trade of Dunfermline is the manufac-
   ture of Table-linens. In no other part of Scotland does the traffic
   in this article exist, although in one or two places a few looms are
   to be found. The trade of the town began more than a century ago,
   with the making of ticks and checks, which continued to be made
   in winter after the table-linen was introduced, which was then wo-
   ven in summer. Like most other arts, it has attained its present
   high excellence by slow and successive improvements.*
      The following three tables were prepared by a committee of
   manufacturers in July 1836, for Joseph Hume, Esq., M. P., and
   may therefore be depended on as having all the accuracy which
   is attainable in such cases.
