feet high; they are at the same time strong and active.
The road from Inverness to this parish, divides into two
branches, near the church; the one branch leading to Ur-
quhart, Fort-Augustus and Fort-William; the other, to
Strath-glass and Kintail, along the fourth side of the Beauly
and Glass; this last road is not yet finished, it has only
come the length of Strath-glass.  It is an excellent road,
made at a considerable expense.  The statute-labour has
been lately commuted in this and the neighbouring pa-
rishnes, which, it is hoped, will have a happy effect in keep-
ing our roads in good repair, and in making new roads
and bridges where these are necessary.  A number of brid-
ges have been erected within these few years past over all
the rivulets that cross these roads.  The smallness of the
farms in this parish is disadvantage: Joining 2 or 3 of them
together, would be of real service to the inhabitants in ge-
neral, could such as are dispossessed be otherwise employed.
Had some of the proprietors spirit to introduce a branch of
the coarse woollen manufacture into this parish, it would be
of infinite service to many of the inhabitants, who could be
usefully employed in this way*.  As the soil of this parish
in general is thin and light, could the small tenants be per-
suaded to lay down a small part of their farms yearly in
white clover and rib-grass, I am convinced, it would be
of considerable benefit to their ground, and enable them to
keep a few more cows in summer; for one acre, under
clover and rib-grass, would produce more grass for pasture,

price of 30 s. the boll in this ans the neighbouring parishes; but by the
generous relief afforded by Government, and the exertion of individuals,
before the end of summer 1783, it was reduced in the town of Inverness 
below 14 s.
