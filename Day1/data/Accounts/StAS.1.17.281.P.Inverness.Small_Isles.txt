of unmarried as 2 to 3, and to the whole population, as 2 to
5 nearly; and the average number of each family is about
5 1/3.  By a list of the inhabitants of this parish, taken by the
late Mr M'Askill, in the year 1768, there were at that pe-
riod in Eigg, 501 souls; in Rum, 302; in Canna, 233, and
in Isle Muck, 172, in all 1208 less than the present popula-
tion by 131; to which, if the number of emigrants hereafter
mentioned be added, the population seems to be greatly on
the increase.
   There are 8 male and 6 female weavers, 1 house-carpen-
ter, and 5 boat-carpenters, 5 taylors, and 2 smiths.  Most

merchants, who bring their goods from the Glasgow market.
There is one clergyman of the Established church, one Ro-

these have their residence in Eigg.
   In Eigg, 8 tenants pay rent to the proprietors; in Canna,
5; in Isle Muck, 24; and in Rum, 43.
   In the years 1788 and 1790, 283 souls emigrated from
this parish to America, and 55 to the mainland of Scotland
and to neighbouring islands; of these 176 left Eigg.  A
principal cause of this emigration was, that the country was
overstocked with people, arising from frequent early mar-
riages; of course, the lands were able to supply them but
scantily with the necessaries of life.  It is not unfrequent,
upon these occasions, for a parent to divide with his newly
married son, the pittance of land (sometimes a very small
portion of a farm) possessed by him, which must reduce both
to poverty and misery.  Another cause of the emigration is,
