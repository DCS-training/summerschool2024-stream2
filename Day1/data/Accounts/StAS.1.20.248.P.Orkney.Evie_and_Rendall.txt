     Statistical Account

of Kirkwall and St Ollay, and part of the parish of Frith; 
and on the west, by the parishes of Harray and Birsay;
from which these united parishes are separated by a chain
of hilly ground, wholly covered with peat-moss and heath;
and a fresh water loch or lake, two miles long, and about 
one-half mile broad.  These parishes lie wholly along the 
sea-shore.  The extreme length, from the fouth-east point
of Rendall, to the north-west point of Evie, is about ten 
miles; the breadth of the inhabited part, from one mile to 
a mile and a half.  There is a kind of earthen fence, called
the Hill Dike, which runs along the whole length of both 
parishes, and separates the corn and grass grounds from the 
hills, mosses, and moors, which lie betwixt these and the 
neighbouring parishes, and which form an undivided com-
mon.  From this dike the cultivated ground generally 
lies in an easy slope to the sea-shore, which is low and flat
till within about a mile of the north west extremity of Evie,
when it rises into a bold rocky promontory called Costay-
head, which forms the fouth side of the entrance to We-
stray Frith, the north side of the entrance being formed by 
a similar promontory in the island of Westray, at about five 
or six leagues distance.  The island of Gairsay, separated 
from Rendall by a strait of about a mile and a half broad,
with three holms, or small uninhabited islands, lie in these 
united parishes.  Gairsay is a green hill, of nearly a coni-
cal figure, from three to four miles in circumference at the 
base, having a pretty large mansion-house, now almost in 
ruins, and a tolerable farm, with four small farms, and some 
cottages, lying on the fouth side of it.  It has also an excel-
lent small harbour, called the Mill-burn, perfectly fecured 
on all sides by the island itself, and a small holm, which co-
vers the entrance to the fouth, leaving a passage on each side 
of it to the harbour.
