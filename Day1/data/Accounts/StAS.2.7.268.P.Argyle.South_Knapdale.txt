of the canal in security.  And in the same year in which it was
opened (1801,) a farther loan of L.9810 was raised among a num-
ber of the original subscribers on transferable securities, bearing
interest at the rate of five per cent. per annum, on none of which
has the interest been paid or the capital liquidated.
   In January 1805, an accident occurred creating an interruption
to the canal, and leading to an expense in repair, by the pressure
of water in the canal blowing up a part of the canal embankment
passing through a moss on the estate of Oakfield, which led to an
application to Government for a further loan of L. 25,000; which
wasobtained from the Exchequer in England that same year, and was
expended in repairing this damage, or rather in altering the course
of the canal for about a quarter of a mile into firmer grounds,-
forming a freestone pier at Ardrissaig, the eastern entrance to
the canal,-strengthening and otherwise securing an embankment
at Bellanach Bay, in the west tract of the canal, which, from the
soft, silty foundation on which it is formed, had greatly subsided,-
securing an increased supply of water with which the canal had
previously been very inadequately supplied,-and on other improve-
ments which the work stood in need of.  In January 1811, an-
other serious accident occurred by the breaking down of the em-
bankment of a recently formed reservoir, which occasioned serious
damage to the lock-gates, embankments, and other works on the
canal adjoining the summit level, which was flooded and injured
to a great extent, and for the repair of which L.5000 was applied
for and obtained from government; but this proving inadequate, and
all other sources having failed, a credit of L.2000 to L.3000 was
obtained from bankers in Glasgow, on the private security of the
Duke of Argyle and his late brother, who, with the disinterested li-
berality inherent in that noble family, came forward on this occasion
to secure the benefit of the former expenditure to the public, and
which loan, it is inferred, has been paid by and remains a debt due
to the Argyle family.
   The above presents a view of the state and pecuniary circumstan-
ces of the Crinan Canal, down to 1814, when the Company was bur-
dened with a debt of L.67,810 exclusive of interest.  it was under
these circumstances that the writer's connection with the canal in
1814 took place; and shortly after, he took an opportunity to
draw up a Report for the governor and directors, which detailed
the state of the canal, and pointed out the repairs and improve-
ments that appeared to be required to render it more secure, effi-
