large trees, of various kinds, such as oak, plane, and chestnut, at
the foot of the rock of Weem, by which it is effectually sheltered
on the north side, and greatlv ornamented. The level of the
grounds being less than 300 feet above the sea, their favorable
exposure, and their sheltered state, render them capable of pro-
ducing all the fruits which can be reared in the open air, in the
highest state of perfection; and the Castle Menzies gean, espe-
cially, has been celebrated all over the country. The castle,
which appears, from a date upon it, to have been built in 1571, is
a fine old building, with several turrets, but it is now in the act of
receiving a very large addition, quite in character with the for-
mer part, which will render it one of the most striking_ mansions
in the north, and likely to be equalled by few in its suit of public
apartments.
     The House of Auchmore, originally a small old building, but
now modernized and greatly enlarged, stands in a park of consi-
derable extent, separated on the west from the parish of Killin by
a lively stream shaded with wood, washed on the north-west
and north by the Dochart, the Dochart and Lochay United, and
Lochtay, and wooded on the south and south-east. The present
Marquis of Breadalbane resided here a considerable time before
his accession.

     Except in the district of Weem, where there is a small increase,
the population has considerably decreased since the last census,
and is continuing to decrease, partly bv emigration from the coun-
try, and partly by removal from the parish to other places, arising
fro the enlargement of farms on the estate of Breadalbane.
    The people may be all said to reside in the country, as the vil-
lage of Weem, the principal one in the parish, is small, and most
its inhabitants are occupiers of land.
