     NUMBER XXXVI.

     PARISH OF LETHENDY.

     (COUNTY OF PERTH.-SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIR-
     LING.-PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD.)

     By Mr LAURENCE BUTTER, Minister.

     Situation and Extent.

   THE parish of Lethendy is situated in the county of
Perth, within the bounds of the synod of Perth and
Stirling, and presbytery of Dunkeld.  Its extent, in a direct
line from east to west, is five miles; its greatest breadth from
south to north, a mile and an half.  It is bounded on the
east by the Burn of Lunan, which divides it from the parish
of Blairgowrie, on the south by Caputh, and on the west
and north by Clunie, parishes.  From the eastern extremity
the ground rises gently westward the whole length of the pa-
rish, except on the west point, where it falls suddenly for
about half a mile.  The river Tay formerly washed the south
west side of this parish.  It has now retired southward to
the distance of nearly two miles, by cuts made at different
periods, leaving behind it, in several places, visible traces of
its former course.

   Soil and Climate.-The west half of the parish is a black
mould inclining to a reddish clay, excepting some small cor-
ners, exceedingly rich, and well adapted to all kinds of crops.
