jacent country, were covered thick with wood.  The Bri-
tons, the Romans, the Anglo-Saxons, the picts, the Scots,
successively possessors of these regions, consumed by degrees
the greater part of the woods, in the ravages of war, in
opening passages through the country, in fuel and domestic
uses, in clearing the ground for cultivation.  The marshes
and the strata of peat-earth likewise evince, that much of
the standing timber was anciently suffered to grow to de-
cay, to fall down, and to moulder away on the ground
where it had been produced.  Here, as in almost every
other part of Scotland, the destruction of the native woods
appears to have been succeeded on the hilly grounds by the
growth of heath, on the lower and flat tracts by the stag-
nation of water, and by mosses and water-plants.  Such
was the general aspect of the lands of this parish, except
on some narrow fields around the farm-steads, till it was
happily changed by the cultivation of these last 30 or 40
years.

   Soil.-On the lower declivities of the hills, and in the
narrow vales dividing them, the soil is commonly a deep
stratum of blackish mould, composed of sand from commi-
nuted fragments of the adjacent rocks, of the exuviæ and
remains of decayed vegetables, and of oils and salts from
the atmosphere and from manures.  On the cultivated up-
lands the stratum of the soil is more shallow, and is of a red-
dish colour, as containing a larger share of stony matter
from the rocks, and a smaller proportion of vegetable
mould.  The marshes present deep strata of peat-earth, of
which the appearance and qualities are sufficiently known.
Its composition is evidently, where it is the most perfectú
from the remains of decayed ligneous vegetables, with the
occasional intermixture of a portion of the remains of gra-
mineous vegetables, and sometimes of a little sand.  Some-
