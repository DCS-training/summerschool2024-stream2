     Statistical Account

the list, because we only mark down the principal head of
the family who receive charity, and are supplied by the
country and the parish though in some families there may
be the husband and the wife, and in others some small chil-
dren beside the husband and wife, or a widow with a
small family in straitened circumstances; so that if every
individual were to be put in the list, the number would be
pretty considerable.  There is no provision made in this
parish for the poor; they are obliged to beg from house to
house through the year, and get their proportion of what
collections are gathered on the Sabbath days, to buy cloaths
and other necessaries; and when any of them come to be
in sickness, or infirm and unable to go about, they have to
depend upon the charity of their nearest neighbour, and
what can be given them extraordinary of the poor's mo-
ney.  Several years ago the county of Stirling attempted
to confine their poor within their  respective parishes; and
after several meetings about it, all the parishes, as far as I
know, except Drumen and Buchanan, agreed to the plan;
by which means the poor of the parishes who agreed to it
were better supplied, and the people freed of a good deal
of trouble in serving them at the door; and besides, were
not liable to get their goods stolen, as formerly, by vagrants
who went about begging.  The poor are every day beco-
ming a heavier burden upon the inhabitants of this parish,
occasioned by the best growing farms in the lower end of
the parish being put under grass, and the small farms in the
head of the parish, many of them being united together and
put under sheep, and let out to people in other parishes who
give nothing for the support of the poor, but leave them a
burden upon the residenters.  There is about L. 280 be-
longing to the poor of the parish, most of which has been
given in different donations by the family of Montrose.
