of the Murrays had a family seat at this place.  The Scottish
spear was an instrument of war much used in the lowlands;
and was always found to be more than a match for the high-
land broad sword.  A proof of this, appears in that rencoun-
ter which took place between Huntly and Murray, at Cor-
richie, October 28th, 1562.  Dr Robertson, when men-
tioning this affair, faith, "The highland broad sword is not
"a weapon fit to encounter the Scottish spear.  In every civil
"commotion, the superiority of the latter has been evident;
"and has always decided the contest."  By statute, 1481,
chap. 81, it is enacted, that spears shall not be made, or
sold, that are shorter than 5 ells and a half.  Gartwhinzian,
from Gart, an head, and Coinnean, a meeting or rendezvous.
Every chieftain had a known place of rendezvous, to which
the whole clan were obliged to repair, on a signal given.
The Rocky Pinnacle, now vulgarly called Gibson's Craig, is
said to be the real Gartwhinzian, where the whole clan of
the Murrays assembled to attend their chief.

   Antiquities.-The antiquities of the parishes, are the fol-
lowing.  The Palace-Brae, Car-Leith, Hall-Yard, Monks-
Grave, Gallow-Know, Trooper's Dubb, and the Reforma-
tion-Clogg.  The Murrays of Tullibardine, the progenitors
of his Grace the Duke of Atholl, were the ancient chieftains
of this parish; and proprietors of a great many other lands in
the neighbourhood.  At this day, the whole of both parishes
still holds of the Duke of Atholl; excepting the barony of
Aldie, the barony of Tulliebole, the barony of Coldrain, the
lands of Pitvar, and one farm belonging to Sir John Stewart
of Grandtully.  This last farm, although it lies in the centre
of the barony of Carnbo, commonly called Carnbo-Stewart,
which was disjoined, as before mentioned, from Perth-shire,
and added to Kinross, still belongs to the county of Perth.
