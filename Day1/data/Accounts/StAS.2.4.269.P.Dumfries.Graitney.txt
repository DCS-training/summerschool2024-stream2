	Manufactures.--The manufacturers in this parish are chiefly
cotton weavers employed by Messrs Dickson and Fergusson of Car-

to the yearly amount of 600 tons, together with an equal quantity
of slate; and grain and potatoes are exported to a very large
amount, chiefly to Liverpool and the other places on the coast of
Lancashire.
