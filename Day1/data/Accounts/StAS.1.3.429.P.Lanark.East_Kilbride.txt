of the poor's money is seldom so much as it was at the above
mentioned period.  The deficiency, owing to the present di-
vided state of the parish, must daily increase.  In all seces-
sions from the Establishment, the poor, from certain motives,
remain but too firmly attached to the church; whilst the
contributions of the people are directed into another chan-
nel.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The parish contains several sub-
jects of antiquity, if old castles, sepulchral tumuli, etc. may
be received amongst the number.  Here, also, a wide field
is opened to the lovers of natural history.  A great variety 
of curious fossils present themselves to view.  Petrisactions
abound in almost every part of the parish.  They are divid-
ed into two kinds, viz. recent and antient.  The recent com-
prehend mosses, etc. petrified by water, containing calcareous
particles.  The antient, or extraneous, divide themselves in-
to two kinds, as they once belonged to the vegetable or ani-
mal kingdom.  Of the former, there are various kinds of pine,
etc. now known by the name of the coal-stalk; of the latter
are varieties of shells, entrochi, fishes teeth, and corralloides,
which are supposed to have originally inhabited the antedi-
luvian ocean*.

graphy of the parish, and an account of its antiquities, etc. may
