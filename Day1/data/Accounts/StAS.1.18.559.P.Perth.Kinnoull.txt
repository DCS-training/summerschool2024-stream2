     of Kinnoul.

   At Balthayock, the seat of an ancient family of the Blairs,
are the remains of an old castle, the walls of which are al-
most entire.  It appears to have been a place of considerable
strength, and bears the marks of great antiquity; but we are
at a loss to know by whom or at what period it was built,
as there is no record found to determine it; and scarcely any
traditional account handed down concerning it.  It is situated
on the top of a den, where many useful herbs and rare plants
are found.  The castle is supposed to have belonged to the
Knights-Templars.

   Hills.-There are 2 hills in this parish, Kinnoul-hill, and
the hill of Murray's-hall, which are rather different parts of
the same ridge of hills, at the distance of 2 miles from one
another; from which there is one of the most beautiful and
extensive prospects.  The hill of Kinnoul, is the most remark-
able.  Its height, above the level of the Tay, is 632 feet.
On the south, it is exceedingly steep, consisting of ragged
rock, and presents a very striking and formidable appearance.
It is covered with a thriving plantation, to the very summit:
On the north side of the hill, there is a gradual ascent, through
a serpentine walk, by which a carriage can easily go to the top.
This is called Montague's walk, from the late Duke of M.
who was in Scotland when it was formed.
   There are several very rare plants to be found on the top of
the hill of Kinnoul, among which, are the following:

     Cynoglossum Officinale     Officinal hounds tongue
     Nepeta Cataria             Cat-mint
     Allium Vineale             Vine Garlick
     Potentilla Argentea        Silver Cinquefoil
     Veronica Saxatilis         Rock-speedwell
     Asplinium Ceterach, etc.
