it was a parsonage, having four churches belonging to it,
which were called the Pendicles of Stobo, viz. the church of
Dawick, upper and lower Drummelzier, Broughton, and
Glenholm.  Dawick is now annexed to Stobo and Drum-
melzier, and what was called, in the original rights of Lors

receives from Sir James Naimyth 10 bolls of meal, which is
converted at the Mid-Lothian Fiars, being the rent of one
half of the glebe and grass of Dawick annexed to Stobo.
There is a manse, and a glebe of 21 English acres, which is
all inclosed, and subdivided with stone walls and quickset
hedges.  The present incumbent inclosed the most part of
the glebe at his own expence.

   Poor.-There are very few persons at present upon the
poor's list; any support which they receive arises from the
weekly collections, and from the interest of some money
which belongs to the kirk-session.

   School.-There is but one school in the parish, which is
taught by the established school-master.  His yearly salary is 
5l. 11s. 1 1/3d.  There are about 24 scholars; from those
that are beginners, or confined to the reading of English, he
receives one shilling per quarter; and from those that are
taught writing and arithmetic, one shilling and sixpence.  He
has a comfortable house, which was built about 15 years 
ago.
