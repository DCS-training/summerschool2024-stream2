 PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN & TWEEDDALE.
          THE REV. JAMES SCOTT, MINISTER.
         I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE ancient name of the parish, as appears from char-
ters of the twelfth century, was Dumanie or Dumanyn. In others
of a later date, it is written indiscriminately, Dummany, Dumanie,
Dalmany, or as at present Dalmeny. It is understood to be of
Celtic origin, and to signify Blach heath, or gloomy spots, of which
there is reason to believe, the greater part of. the. parish at one
time consisted.
   Extent and Boundaries.-The parish proper exclusive of Auld-
cathie, which was once a separated parish or vicarage, and which
lies at a distance of 1 1/2 miles from its western extremity, (being dis-
joined from it by parts of Kirkliston and Abercorn,) is about 4
miles in length, and 21 in breadth. It stretches along the south-
ern shore of the Frith of Forth from a burn which separates it
from Cramond parish on the east, to that of Abercorn on the
west. Its southern boundary is Kirkliston parish and the river
Almond. The name ofthe disjoined portion, Auldcathie, pro-

battle burn." Its length, which is one and a-half mile, is termi-
nated by the parish of Linlithgow on the west, and Kirkliston on
the east: its breadth three-fourths of a mile, by Ecclesmachan on
the south, and Abercorn on the north. The two portions toge-
comprise an area of 9371 miles.
   Topography, Geology, &c.-In the parish of Dalmeny proper,
which, from its proximity to the Forth, its undulating surface, and
its high state of cultivation, stands almost unrivalled for its beauty
there are three considerable elevations, ranging at about 380 feet
above the level of the sea. Dundas Hill, on the west, runs for
three-quarters of a mile from nearly north-west to south-east, pre-
senting to the south-west a precipitous front to the height of about
