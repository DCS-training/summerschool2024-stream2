                        PARISH OF KIRKMAHOE.

		PRESBYTERT OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.

	           THE REV. JOHN WIGHTMAN, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY,
	Name and Boundaries.-THE name of the parish is of doubtful
origin, but perhaps it may signify the church in the valley, or in
the plain, near or by the river. Indeed, the Nith is still not
far from the church, and has left evident proofs of its having, at
some former period, run close by the church walls, and passed
through lochar Moss in its way to the Solway Frith. The pa-
rish is bounded by Dunscore on the S. and S. E.; by Holywood
on the W.; by Dunscore on the N. W.; by Closeburn on the
N.; and by Kirkmichael and Tinwald on the N. E. and E. It
is 7,1/2 miles in length, and, at its greatest breadth, it is 5 1/2 miles
broad. It contains between 18 and 19 square miles.
	Topographical Appearances.--The hills range from N. to S.,
with peaks pointing eastward, and the exposure is W. and S. W.
--the land rising gradually till it terminates in heights, some of
which are 600, and some 670, feet above the level of the sea.
Wardlaw (Guard hill) and Auchengeith hill rise 770 feet above
the sea level, and have a declivity southward. Our hill streams
have in several places formed " herinit-fancied caves" for their
Naiads out of the living rock, in the most curious style; and there
is a cave at Crofthead of Dalswinton which deserves to be men-
tioned. Kirkmahoe is entirely an inland parish, but there is a
beautiful view of the sea, from the uplands and hills, especially the
Watchman's hill, where in a clear day the Solway is seen in the
distance.
	Meteorology.--The medium temperature is about 470 and the
prevailing winds are the W. and the S. W. We, as well as others,
have our prognostics of changes in the weather. Not to men-
tion the signs afforded by Criffel, a high hill which overlooks
the estuary of the Nith, we may notice that if, during  the day, the
