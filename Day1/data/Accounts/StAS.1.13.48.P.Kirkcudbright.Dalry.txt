But how shall we convince the farmer, that is is his inte-
rest, as well as the proprietor's, to manure and cultivate the
poorest of the arable land in his farm, even in preference to
the richest?  If he possesses an extensive farm, we might
find it almost impossible to remove all his objections:  but
if he possesses only a small farm, and has a lease of it for a
considerable number of years, the business will not be diffi-
cult.  His necessities will oblige him, at least if he be a
man of any experience, to observe the very method which
we would porpose.  If there are any of his lands in so good
a condition for pasture, that he could scarce expect to make
them better, and at the same time needs them for that pur-
pose, he will not rashly break them up to the detriment of
his cattle:  but if there are any of his land which he sees
to be of little value for pasture, yet capable of cultivation,
will be not naturally consider, that here, without any con-
siderable loss of pasture, he may, by manure and culture,
raise corn for the subsistence of his family?  Though, on a
superficial view, it may appear paradoxical, experience
will soon convince him, that by manure and culture the
poorest lands may be rendered the fittest for corn:  for
where the soil is very rich, the crop may take a fine show
till it begin to shoot, or put forth the ears; but then the
slightest rain lays it down to the ground, where it lies till
it rots, or, at best, it produces ears, partly empty, and
partly not half filled:  whereas the poorest lands, if they
are dry, and have a moderate depth of soil, though ploughed
deep, and plentifully manured, will produce crops not apt
to be too luxuriant, and to be laid down by rain, but hardy,
and with ears plump and full.  The greater part of the
arable lands in this parish are naturally so poor, that with-
out manure they do not yield a crop of any value; but
when properly manured and cultivated, they produce corn,
if not in as great abundance, yet of a superior quality to
