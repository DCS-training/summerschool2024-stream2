thers, of the name of Wilson, of the Cleugh family, Swedish
merchants in London, both gentlemen of interprise and
large capital; and although the manufacture is unluckily sub-
jected to a temporary stagnation, yet no doubt can be enter-
tained of its turning out a very beneficial speculation to the
proprietors.  This work is peculiarly happy in its situation
with respect to materials, for in the very ground on which
the blast furnaces are erected (two in number) there are coal,
ironstone, limestone, and fire-clay, all essentially necessary for
carrying on the manufacture; and perhaps there is not a
work of the kind in Britain, which has all these materials so
near at hand, and in such abundance.  The land carriage of
the iron to the nearest port, Borrowstounness, is about 18
miles, and to Leith about 27; but, by a line of road now
marked out, the distance to Leith will be reduced to about
21 miles.  The carriage in summer is about 8 s. and in win-
ter 10 s. per ton.-The workmen, of different descriptions,
employed before the temporary stagnation mentioned above,
such as, furnace-men, forge-men, miners, coalliers, etc. with
their families, may be computed at upwards of 400.  The
blast furnaces are employed in casting pig-iron, and ten
forges in converting these pigs into blooms, a name given to
the iron before it undergoes the last operation, viz. beating
out into bars.

   Population.-There are about 3000 in the parish, of these,
