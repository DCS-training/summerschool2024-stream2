to 18, and get from 1 s. to 5 s. a-month.  The Antiburgher
kirk-session distributes 20 L. Sterling annually to the poor in
this parish, besides contributing to the relief of others that
attend their meeting-house from neighbouring parishes.  There
are no begging poor in the parish, yet no place is more pester-
ed with vagrants and poor from other quarters.

   Roads and Bridges.-There are 2 public roads; that
which leads to Fife by Newburgh is in tolerable repair; the
other, which is through the glen of Abernethy (and by which
great quantities of coal and lime are brought from Fife to
Strathearn) is very bad; that which strikes off the glen to
Auchtermuchty, is in winter almost impassable.  The statute
labour, and composition-money allowed, are totally inadequate
to keep these roads in repair.  There are 2 bridges over the
Farg; the one at Gowly, which is old and ruinous, the
other below Potty Mill, which is too narrow for carriages,
and lies at some distance from the public road.  A new bridge
over this water, near Aberargie, would be a desirable object,
as after heavy rains it swells to such a height, and is so rapid,
that it is both difficult and dangerous to crofs it.

   Antiquities.-In the church-yard stands a tower of an ex-
traordinary construction.  It consists of 64 courses of hewn
stone, laid circularly and regularly, is in height 74 feet, in
circumference 48 feet.  It is difficult to assign this to any but
the Picts, as it stands in the capital of their dominions.  There
is but one other tower of a similar structure in Scotland, viz.
at Biechin.  The use of these towers, according to the latest
and most probable conjectures, was not only for the con-
finement of those who were doing penance, but also for call-
ing people to public worship by the sound of a horn or
trumpet, before the introduction of bells.  S. W. from the
town there is a hill, called Castle-law.  Tradition says there
