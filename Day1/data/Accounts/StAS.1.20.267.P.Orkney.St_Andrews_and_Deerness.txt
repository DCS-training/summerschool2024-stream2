cumbent was settled.  After a litigious and expensive pro-
cess, it was completely repaired about three years ago, and
is now the best in the country.  The glebe was, at the ad-
mission of the present incumbent, in value about L. 4 Ster-
ling yearly.  It is now considerably better, he having, at
his own expence, inclosed the whole, and subdivided a part
with sufficient stone-dikes, (copped with fail or turf), of
from three one-half to five feet high.  The expence of in-
closing has been above 100 guineas.  There is also a glebe
in the parish of Deerness, which rents at between L. 4 and
L. 5 Sterling.  The stipend of this charge, by a decreet of
the Court of Session, in 1729, was fixed at L. 500 Scots in
money, and 10 meils of oat-meal, communion-elements in-
cluded.  The late Mr Scollay obtained a decreet of aug-
mentation, for 8 meils 5 settings of oat-meal, 14 meils of
malt, and 5 barrels of grease butter, in the year 1773; but
it has never yet been localled, nor the arrears paid up.  The
whole, including the allowance for communion-elements,
does not exceed L. 75 Sterling.  Lord Dundas is patron of
this, and most of the other charges in Orkney.  The socie-
ty for Propagating Christian Knowledge have a school in
Deerness, with a salary of L. 15.  The schoolmaster, who
is a sensible man, and successful in teaching, gets no fees
from his scholars.  He has brought up, in a decent manner,
a family of 10 children.

   Poor.-The only fund for the relief of the poor, is the
Sabbath collections, which amount to about 30 s. yearly.

any part of the country.  The number of poor on the list
is 25.

   Rent of the Parish.-The valued rent of the united pa-
