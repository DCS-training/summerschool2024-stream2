upon the E. side of the square, within which the cloisters
have stood.  In the middle of the apartment is a pillar,
about 14 feet high, from which 8 arches spring, and have
their terminations in the surrounding walls: The centre
of every arch is ornamented with foliage and different
figures, remarkably well cut in coarse free stone.  From
the solidity of the workmanship which remains, a probable
conclusion may be drawn, that the hand of time would
never have overturned it; neither had the zeal of the
good people in Galloway for Reformation extended to stone
walls, even though they had contained Roman Catholicks;
for it had remained for near 100 years after the Refor-
mation, without suffering any material injury*.  But li-
berty had, after that time, been given by the incumbents
to the people to pick out the free stone, which brought
it to ruins.  The pillar, which is much admired for its
just proportions, has escaped the general destruction, ei-
ther from the difficulty of removing the rubbish which had
fallen upon the arches, or the danger of its burying the
depredators in its ruins, had any attempt been made be-
low the arches to pull it down.

11 or 12 years before, abbeys, cathedrals, and churches, in other parts
of Scotland, had perished.  It appears, from the records of the presby-
tery of Stranraer, that the building was almost entire at the division of
the parish in 1646.
