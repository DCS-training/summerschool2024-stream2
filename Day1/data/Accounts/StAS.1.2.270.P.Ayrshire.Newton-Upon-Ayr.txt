for many years.  It was rented from the town, at L. 250 per
annum; but the work was abandoned about 10 years ago, and
the lease was consequently broken.  It was resumed in 1786,
by a company of respectable gentlemen at Edinburgh, and has
ever since been carried on with success.  The tacksmen pay
a duty of 6 d. to the town for every ton they raise.  The first
3 or 4 years, the town's profits amounted to above L. 300 per
annum, which makes the number of tons above 1200 yearly, but,
for the two last years, the produce has not been so considerable.
-The greatest part of the coal is shipped for Ireland.-The
present company, at some expence, have made a waggon way
from the pits to the harbour, the road reaching to the key,
which renders it exceedingly convenient for loading vessels.-
The price of the coal is 5 s 6 d. per ton, each ton weighing 24
cwt.  The quantity of water in the pits is so considerable,
that it was found necessary to erect a large steam engine.  The
pumps are of 14 inches bore; and the quantity of water
discharged is 36 gallons at each stroke, the stroke being repeat-
ed about ten times in the minute, or 360 gallons in the minute.
This discharge continues 20 hours in the 24.-There are two
seams of coal, about 4 feet thick each, the upper seam is 30
fathoms deep from the surface; the greatest part of which
near the town, is already wrought.  The lower seam, which
is 20 fathoms deeper that the upper, is still untouched.  No
probable conjecture has been formed, what quantity of coals
remains in the grounds of the community.  There is another
coal pit in the parish, belonging to a private individual,
wrought by the above tacksmen, for which, they paya duty of
10 d per tun; but it is of small extent, and will soon be exhaust-
ed.  The coal in the Blackhouse grounds, in the neighbour-
hood, being in the parish of St Quivox, comes not with-
in the limits of this description.
