	      Value of produce disposed of by the growers,       L. 25,409 17  0

	This may appear a small sum applicable for rent, expense of
production and interest on capital, but it is to be kept in mind
that the tenant's family, servants, horses, &c. are maintained, and
seed-corn, &c. taken from the undisposed produce.
	Manufactures.--The manufactures are confined to spinning of
flax into yarn, and its manufacture into brown linen.  The only
spinning mill is that at Auchinblae, originally erected by Mr Kin-
near, and now belonging to Farquharson and Company, where about
60 people are employed, who work about eleven hours and a half
daily.  The hands employed are 16 men, from 8s. to L. 1 per
week; 6 boys from 2s. to 7s. per week; 38 women and girls from
2s. to 5s. 6d. per week.

	45,000 spindles flax yarn per annum, value                  L. 6200  0  0
	25,000 do. ton yarn per annum, value                           3800  0  0

        70,000 spindles yarn spun,                          Value L. 10,000  0  0

	In addition to this, a number of hands are employed as weavers
in  Auchinblae, of who in some are natives of the parish, but many
come from other parts of the country, and do not generally re-
main long in one place.  By these, about 29,700 spindles are
made into 117,680 yards of linen, the value of the yarn being
about L. 3712, and of the linen L, 4640. The price paid for
weaving averages Id. to 1 3/4d. per yard.
	Corn-Mills.--There are five corn-mills, situated in different
parts of the parish, with drying kilns attached. At none of these
