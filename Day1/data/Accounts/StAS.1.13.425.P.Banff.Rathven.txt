   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The parish possesses all
the advantages that local situation can give.  And its
greatest disadvantages have already in part been mention-
ed.  Many melancholy examples of the fatal consequences
arising from the want of harbours have been produced;
and extreme inconveniency and frequent dangers are ex-
perienced, from having no custom-house nearer than In-
verness, which is 50 miles distant.  The failure of the plan
in agitation, for obtaining a custom-house at Banff, must
prove a great loss to the fisheries and manufactures in this
corner.  Short leases, and what is here termed run rigging,
are hurtful to the farmer.  It has already been observed,
that a great part of the parish is exposed to the north-west-
erly winds, which are often hurtful to the crop.  And
even this inconveniency is susceptible, in some measure,
of being remedied.  For proper encouragement, to enclose,
and plant hedges, on a judicious plan, would contribute to
counteract the ill effects of these winds, by sheltering the
fields from their influence.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is a lint-mill at Gol-
lachie, built by a manufacturer in Fochabers, for beating
flax; which is sufficient to beat 6 mats a day.  He imports
300 mats yearly from Rotterdam, of which the prime cost
