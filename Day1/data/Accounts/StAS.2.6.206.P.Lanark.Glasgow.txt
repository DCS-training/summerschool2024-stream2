	Private Carriages.--Mr Allan Dreghorn, timber-merchant and
builder, was the first person who started a private carriage in this
city. It was made by his own workmen in 1752. The number of
carriages in the city and suburbs charged with duty in 1832 was
402, viz stage-coaches 61; hackney carriages 140; private carri-
ages, 201, viz. with four wheels 114, two wheels 87. The private
carriages have increased considerably during the lost two years.
	Relays of post-chaises did not exist in Scotland except on the
roads from Edinburgh to London, till the year 1776; and even in
England, relays are of comparatively recent date. Mr John Glass-
ford and Mr Andrew Thomson Senior, Glasgow merchants, went
to London on horseback in the year 1739. At that period there
was no turnpike road till they came to Grantham, within 110 miles
of London. Up to that point they travelled upon a narrow cause.
way, with an unmade soft road upon each side of it; and they met
from time to time strings of pack-horses, from thirty to forty in a
gang,--the mode by which goods were transported from one part
of the country to another.
	Mills.--The town mills on the Molendinar Burn, erected
about the middle of the fourteenth century, supplied from the
Hogganfield, and Frankfield lochs, are not of so much use to the
inhabitants, as they were before steam-mills were introduced. The
water and steam-mills on the river Kelvin, at Partick and Clay-
slap, belonging to the corporation of bakers, are very extensive, and
of a superior construction. The establishment contains a large
steam-mill, seven water-wheels, twenty-two pairs of stones, (Bour-
deaux Burrs,) six boultin, and three shealing machines. The gra-
naries and kilns are proportionate to the mills, which can grind
12,000 bushels of wheat weekly. The bakers got a grant of their
old mill at Partick from the Regent Murray, for their services at
the battle of Langside on 13th May 1568. The value of the mill
property os upwards of L. 50,000.
	Markets.--The markets for buther-meat, fish, cheese, butter,
&c. have been much neglectedof late. The great increase of
the town has induced persons at a distance from the markets to
