yearly.  In 1791, finding the above assessment insufficient for
making the extent of road necessary, they railed it to 18 s.
Sterling per annum, and 2 s. to every cottager, agreeable to an
act of parliament for repairing roads in the county of Lanark.

   Minerals.-There are a number of freestone quarries in the
parish.  The stones are very fit for building, and take a fine,
polish.  There are also vast quantities of whin rocks, very
proper materials for roads.  We have an inexhaustible rock
of limestone, which has of late been wrought to a considerable
extent, both at Grankirk and Robroystone.-No coal, fit for
working, has yet been discovered, though it is the; opinion of
miners, and people of skill, that the seams of coal, which

   Rent, Soil, Cultivation, Produce, etc.-The valuation of the
whole parish, is 6270 L. Scotch; and the present yearly rent,
may be about 6000 L. Sterling.-There is no mountain in this

we have several different soils; such as, light randy till, deep
earth, and plenty of moss for fuel.-Improvement of land has
greatly increased of late, and is still going on very rapidly, both
by the plough and by manure.  Excellent crops of oats, barley,
clover, and rye grass, potatoes and flax, are produced.  Oats
have sold, before reaping, at 8 L. 2 s 6 d. per acre, and yielded
16 bolls each acre.  Potatoes are much cultivated here, and
served up at every table.  They are a substitute for bread,
among the lower class of people, for at least 10 months in the
year; and, with very little attention, they make the old crop
last, till it is succeeded by the new: 100 bolls have been
