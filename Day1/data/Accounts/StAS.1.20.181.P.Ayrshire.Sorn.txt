gun in the spring of that year, and finished in the spring fol-
lowing.  The house measures 80 feet long, by 52 1/2 wide
over the walls.  It has also a large projection in front, for
2 stairs to the galleries, and for the steeple, when they shall
be erected.  Many of the subscribers failed to pay the amount
of their subscriptions.  There was not mere than L. 80 Ster-
ling of the whole collected.  Mr Alexander, therefore, ad-
vanced above L. 750 Sterling on the security of the feat-
rents, but has not, as yet, received a single farthing of either
principal or interest.  Had feuing gone on as briskly as it
did previous to the year 1793, it is presumed this gentleman
would have been reimbursed in a few years for this great
outlay; but the scarcity of hands, all over the country, has
put an entire stop to feuing.  Indeed, the population of the
village has decreased considerably since that periods, as men-
tioned in another part of this Report.  The seats erected in
the area of the chapel, have never yet been completely fil-
led.  When the galleries are put up, the chapel will con-
tain above 1500 sitters.  It is beautifully situated on rising
ground, which commands a view of the whole village and
the surrounding banks.  It is esteemed a great ornament to
the place.

   The author of this Report, was ordained, by the Presby-
tery of Ayr, to serve the cure, on the 12th of September
1792.  The living is only L. 60 annually, without manse
or glebe; a sum perfectly inadequate to the necessary ex-
pences of a clergyman.  The slender funds of this infant
establishment, cannot admit of an augmentation of stipend.
If Properly represented, the Company would probably al-
low at least a free house.

   The Company pay a very laudable attention to the mo-
rals and education of youth. They have built a large school-
room, and appointed a schoolmaster, with an annual salary
of L. 15 Sterling, and a free house, equal to L. 3, 5 2. more;
