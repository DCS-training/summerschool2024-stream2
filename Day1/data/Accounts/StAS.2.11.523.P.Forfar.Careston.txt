	It may here be mentioned, that, many years ago, a Falco pere-
grinus was caught in this parish. It was uncommonly large and
vicious, quite different from the gentle falcon before spoken of.

<FOOTNOTE>One mole was got here last spring, pure white as the new-fallen snow.
      One of the long-sared kind was blown down, along with the church belfry,in
the great storm, 11th October 1898, and held fast by one of the large stones. The
incumbent freed it, when it flow back to the church: being caught by its tail, it was
uninjured.
      The wood chat, Lanius Collurio, has been repeatedly seen here by the incumbent.
      It may here be mentioned, that a pair of wild geese formed an association with
a flock of tame geese belonging to Mr Skene, who caused great care to be taken
of them, insomuch, that they were regularly fed and housed, along with their domes-
tic associates; with these they wintered for several years, and as rdgtlurly departed
during breeding season, and again returned to their former companions by the
end of the autumn, but unaccompanied with thier young.
  On the other hand, some tame ducks belonging to the farm of Nether Careston,
on being repeatedly seared from the poultry house by dogs, first grew timid, and at
last became quite wild, and flew away altogether. Afterwards, they were repeatedly
observed flying about in the air like ordinary wild ducks; and at no great distance,
some ducks quite light-coloured, like tame once, have been sprung from marshy
ground in the midst of a covey of wild ones.
      A specimen of the Colymbus glacialis, or ember-goose of Bewick, was shot here
on the 21st October 1839, by the gamekeeper of Colonel Swinburn of Marcus, in
the vicinity,
