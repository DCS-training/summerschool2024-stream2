   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the po-
pulation was then 537.  By a careful survey in 1792,
the number of the inhabitants, old and young, amounts
to 520.  It is generally believed that population has
decreased within these 40 or 50 years past.  Of the
above number, there are 249 males and 271 females.
The record of baptisms before the 1769 had received
no kind of attention.  The average of baptisms and
marriages, hath been 13 baptisms, and 8 or 9 marriages
yearly, since the 1769.  There has never been a record of
burials kept.  The letting of large farms to one tenant,
which were formerly let to 4, 6, and 8 tenants, must be an
obvious cause of depopulation, joined with the late erection

The farmers, of late years, find much difficulty in finding labourers at
the above high wages, which bears hard upon them, and renders the la-
bour of agriculture very expensive.  This is owing of late to the intro-
duction of the cotton manufacture, which occupies great numbers, who
formerly were engaged in the labour of agriculture.-The price of oat-
meat is generally, in fruitful season, about 1 s. 6 d. and 1 s. 9 d. the
stone, which is equal to 2 pecks of Linlithgow measure.  Potatoes are 1 s.
and 1 s. 4 d. the peck.  In the years of scarcity, 1782 and 1783, the price
of meal was high, but there was still plenty of it in this corner, owing,
in a great measure, to the early season of the harvest in this and some of
the neighbounng parishes.  The price of beef is generally 3 d. and 3 1/2 d.
the pound, English weight; and mutton and lamb, 2 d. 2 1/2 d. and 3 d.
the pound, ditto weight; pork, at 2 d. and 2 1/2 d. the pound, ditto weight.
Fresh beef and mutton is generally high priced in the spring.  Batter is
6 d. and 7 d. the pound, English; and cheese, 2 1/2 d. and 3 d. the pound,
ditto weight.  These prices may all of them be reckoned reasonable, con-
sidering the high rent of land, and the high wages paid by the farmer
for every article of labour, in the management of his farm.
