   Boundaries and Extent.-This parish lies in the shire and
presbytery of Wigton, and Synod of Galloway, being part
of the peninsula formed, on one side by Wigton Bay and
Solway Frith, and on the other by Luce Bay.  From the
place where it joins Sorbie, it stretches along the eastern
coast, doubling Burgh Head, and looking towards the Mull
of Galloway, the ancient Novantum Chersonesus and Pro-
montorium.  From N. to S. it measures about seven miles
and three quarters; and from E. to W. about four miles
and one quarter.  It is bounded by Wigton Bay, Solway
Frith, and the parish of Sorbie, on the E.; by Luce Bay
and the parish of Glasserton, on the W.; and by the pa-
rishes of Glasserton and Sorbie, on the N.

   Face of the Country.-The face of the country is varie-
gated with hills and valleys.  In some places, the land is
broken, and appears barren at a distance, but upon exami-
nation, it is found deep and rich.  Such land here is dry,
provided with shelter, and of the first quality for grazing.
The soil of this parish is in general fertile, divided by stone
walls, covered with lime, sea shells or marl, and produces
rich crops, or feeds the best cattle.
