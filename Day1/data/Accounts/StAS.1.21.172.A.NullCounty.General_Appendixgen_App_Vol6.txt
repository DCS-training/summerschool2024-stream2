   In consequence of the above arrangement, during the year
1791 no fewer than 35 of the old tenants agreed, upon the
foresaid conditions: for 8 acres each of the Flow-moss.  Thus
1200 acres are now disposed of to 115 tenants, But when
these 35 tenants small each have cleared their acre, then, ac-
cording to agreement, 35 additional tenants will speedily be
acquired; and the moss will then contain in all 150 families.
   To the leases already granted to the tenants in the High
Moss, it is now determined to add a further period of
years, (making in all 57 years,) during which they are to pay
one guinea per acre; a rent not greater than the land is
worth even at present, but greatly below its probable value
at that distant period; This: it is hoped, will prove to the
tenants a sufficient incitement to continue their operations
till their possessions are completely cleared from moss.
   Having now gone through, in detail, the whole progress
of the colony since its first settlement in the year 1767; it
still remains to take a general view of the effects produced by
that establishment.
   For several years, at first, the water was used chiefly to car-
ry off moss, in the forming of new roads, and preparing
servoirs; which considerably retarded the principal object of
gaining land.  Nevertheless there have been cleared full 300
acres of excellent land, producing wheat, barley, oats, and
clover, yielding from six to twelve bolls after one.
   From the nature of the undertaking, there is good reason
to suppose that the operations will yearly advance with great-
er rapidity; especially as the greater number of the settlers
have only of late begun to operate.  Many, besides maintain-
ing their families otherwise by occasional employments, have
in the High Moss cleared in a year one rood of land; some
have cleared two, some three roods, and in the Low Moss an
