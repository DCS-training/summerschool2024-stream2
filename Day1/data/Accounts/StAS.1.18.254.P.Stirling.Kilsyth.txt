schoolmaster be appointed postmaster if he resides in a post
town, or land surveyor for the parish in which he officiates;
neither of these employments would engross too much of his at-
tention.  And either of them might be a handsome addition to
his income.  Besides the parochial school which is very properly
placed in the centre of the village, there are two, sometimes
three private schools in it, besides one in the centre of the
east, and one in that of the west barony.
   The latter of these at Chapelgreen was erected in the year
1723, in consequence of a donation of L. 60 ster. from Mr.
John Patrick merchant in London, and a native of this parish.
That sum according to the terms of the donation, was devo-
ted to the purpose of building the school and endowing the
teacher with a yearly salary not exceeding L. 3 ster. in order
that he might be enabled to teach the poor scholars gratis.
The session are nominated trustees of the fund under the in-
spection of the presbytery; and they are likewise patrons of
the school.
   The school in the east barony is at Banton; it is generally
well attended, though the encouragement to the teacher is
not very great.  He has a dwelling house; and William
Cadell, Esq. proprietor of the estate of Banton, has very
liberally contributed to the support of the teacher from year
to year.  There may be at an average 260 scholars taught
annually within the bounds of the parish.

   Poor.-The poor belonging to this parish, are not nume-
rous; excepting in years of great scarcity, or want of em-
ployment.  They are of course, liberally supplied.
   The funds are raised chiefly from the weekly collections,
though in part from occasional donations.  There is besides
this, a sum collected annually for the use of the mortcloths.
