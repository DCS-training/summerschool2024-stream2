   Surface and Soil.-The surface of this parish is flat, with
little variety from rising grounds, except towards Black-
hills, where the fields gradually ascend.  The foil varies;
here, a rich loam, there, clay, but, in general, it is sandy,
abounding with calcareous particles, and, on the whole, is
fertile, producing plenty of grain, and of good quality.
Within these few years, the quality of pasture is enlar-
ged, and abundance of hay raised, by the introduction of
artificial grasses.  This is greatly promoted by a climate
friendly to vegetation, which, at the same time, gives so
little interruption to the operations of the husbandman,
that, it is reckoned, there are about three months more, of
fair weather here, than in many places of the neighbouring
county of Banss.

   Agriculture.-Even in very remote times, the cultiva-
of the soil seems to have been properly attended to,
in this part of Scotland:  Our historians, it is true, chiefly
employ themselves in retailing legendary stories, or giving
inaccurate accounts of foreign or domestic wars, and poli-
tical contests, overlooking unfortunately, the more impor-
tant details of industry, trade, and population.  In an in-
vestigation of this nature, therefore, scattered facts must
be collected, and casual and contingent sources of informa-
tion relied on; the result of which, however, is, that this
country was anciently well cultivated and productive.
