   1. The Gartcloss mine, or inclined plane, is 30 fathoms deep,
and contains the Pyotshaw, Main, and Splint coals, and they are
now sinking to the Virtueweil and Kiltongue.  The Ell-coal,
which is 8 fathoms above the Pyotshaw, seems to be off here, but
they begin to work it at Mount Vernon, and away west to Glas-
gow.
   2. Gartgill, (Mr Colt) 40 fathoms deep, has the three main
seams. The Main and Pyotsbaw are within 10 inches of each
other, and form a working of 12 feet.
   3. Gartsherrie, No. 1, 40 fathoms, all the seams; No. 2, 30
fathoms, all the seams except the Ell-coal, which is here cropt off.
   4. Gunnie, (Messrs Baird,) No. 1, 27 fathoms, all the coals
except the Ell. No. 2, now sinking 50 fathoms, all the coals.
   5. Greenhill, (William Baillie).  All the coals except the ell,
about 18 fathoms to the splint.
   6. Drumpellier (Mr Buchanan,) Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6, varying
from 36 to 70 fathoms.  In one of these pits the Pyotshaw and
main coals are wrought together, at an aggregate thickness of 7 1/2
feet.  The splint here is very thin, only from 26 to 40 inches.
   7. Calder Iron-works,-2 coal-pits, one 100 fathom, the deep-
est inthe parish; other pit 40 fathoms, all the coals.
   8. Palace Craig, 2 pits, one 40 fathoms, another 70 fathoms,
about 24 fathoms above the ell coal.  The succession of strata
in the evening space are as follows:
