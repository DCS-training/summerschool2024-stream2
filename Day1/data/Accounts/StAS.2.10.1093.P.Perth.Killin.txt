supported by the Marchioness, and taught by females; 2 adven-
ture schools. In the parish school, besides the ordinary branches,
Greek, Latin, mathematics, and book-keeping are efficiently
taught. In March the number in attendance at all the schools was
435, being one in four of the population. The parish school is en-
dowed with the maximum salary, with a commodious house and
garden. The Society's teachers have from L.15 to L.17, with a
free house, croft, and cow's grass. Lady Breadalbane's schools
are also endowed. The teacher at Killin receives L.20, with a
free house, garden, and fuel. In this school about 50 girls and 10
boys receive their education gratis. The girls, in addition to the
usual branches, are taught sewing and knitting. There is also adame
school in the village, where very young children attend, and are
taught the rudiments of English and Gaelic with knitting, and we
are not sure but the venerable teacher might lay claim to the ho-
nour of having invented the infant school system; she has a free
house from the Marchioness.
  All the children above six years of age can read, and nearly all
in Gaelic and English. Among the aged, espebially the females,
there are many that cannot write, but of the young, both boys and
girls, almost all learn writing and arithmetic. The expense of edu
cation may average for the whole year about 10s. We must
add that nearly all the people, even the poorest, make an effort
to give to their children the benefits of education. Most of the
teachers bestow much care on the communication of religious
knowledge to their pupils.
  Literature.-There is a library in the parish, consisting of, about
300 volumes, principally of religious books. The Breadalbane Phi-
lanthropic Association has been existence for several  years, and
has been of great use in furnishing the Scriptures and school books
to the people at a low rate.
  Savings Bank.-It was instituted in 1832, and its advantages
are felt and acknowledged by the population, for it often stands
in good stdad when rent-day comes round. The following gives

posited L.91, 15s; depositors, 17. 1833 amount deposited,
