     of Linton

   The people are either farmers, or mechanics and shop-
keepers; generally one, and sometimes two surgeons; for-
merly an exciseman; lead carters and carriers; no lawyers.
Two or three looms work cotton cloth independently, or
linen for the manufacturers in Edinburgh, or even Glasgow.
There are about two dozen of looms in the village.

   In the memory of old people, the mode of living is much
altered.  The great expence formerly was in drinking two-
penny.  The farmers ate no flesh but what died of itself;
onions was a common relish to their bread.  Their clothes
were homespun and coarse.  More flesh is now consumed
even by cottagers, than formerly by farmers.

   The situation of every class of people is much improved.
Even within these few years labourers wages are considerably
raised.  A good ploughman gets L. 6, and meat in the house;
or 6 1/2 bolls of meal, and L. 1:6:0 annually, instead of meat.
If he marries he gets a houses, for which his wife shears all
harvest with his master, who drives in her fuel, and gives her
land for lint or potatoes.  She generally gets offalls of milk
and whey, etc. if she is liked.  A good servant maid has L. 3
per annum.

   Day labourers have 8 d. in summer and 6 d. in winters,
with victuals; woman at out-work 3 d. but often 4 d. with
victuals.  In harvest men get 10 d. women 8 d. with vic-
tuals.  Taylors 6 d. and  victuals.  Masons and joiners are
over-proportioned to other labourers, from the demand to
Edinburgh, and get 1 s. with victuals.  Few enlist, as they
have plenty of employment at home.  Some six or eight may
have emigrated to America;  they write flattering accounts
to their friends, but complain of their distance from religious
