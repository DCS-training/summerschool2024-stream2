     NUMBER XXXII.

     PARISH OF KILLEAN AND KILCHENZIE,

     (COUNTY OF ARGYLE, SYNOD OF ARGYLE, AND PRESBY-
     TERY OF KINTYRE.)

     By the Rev. ALEXANDER STUART.

     Situation.

   THIS parish (which consisted of two parishes till after
the Reformation) derives its name from its two pa-
tron saints, John and Kenneth, with Kill (Cella) prefixed.
It is situated in the presbytery of Kintyre, and county of
Argyle.  It is bounded on the south by the parish of Camp-
belltown, on the north by the parish of Kilcalmonell, on the
east by the united parishes of Saddel and Skipness, and on
the west by the Atlantic Ocean.  Its length, by the mea-
surement of the road, is 18 miles; and its breadth about 4.

   Soil, etc.-The soil along the coast is in general sharp and
sandy, but yields good crops of bear, potatoes, and oats,
from the abundant application of sea-ware, driven in by the
storms, and collected by the farmers for manure.  The
arable soil upon the higher grounds is generally a thin coat
of peat earth, on a till bottom.  In the mountain there is
very little of green pasture, bring mostly covered with
heath.
