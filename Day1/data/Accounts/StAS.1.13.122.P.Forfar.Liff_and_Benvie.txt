     Statistical Account

the first of which it were difficult to remedy, are chiefly to
be ascribed the low state of the parochial school, and the
introduction of 5 private ones, for the most part indefferent-
ly taught.  At the former, the quarterly payments are,
for English, 1 s. 6 d.; for writing, 2 s.; for arithmetic, 2 s.
6d.  The salary allowed the schoolmaster is L. 7: 1: 10
money, and 2 bolls 14 pecks oat-meal; as session-clerk,
he receives L. 1: 15: 6, and about L. 3: 1: 6 more
for baptisms and marriages.  The whole emoluments are
too inconsiderable for a teacher of any merit and capacity.
   -With respect to the poor, there has never been any as-
sessment for their maintenance.  The funds for their relief
arise from the dues of mortcloths, proclamation of marria-
ges, rent of a few seats in the church, money at interest, but
chiefly from the collections at the church door.  Besides the
number now on the roll, amounting to 12, there are several
families and individuals which require occasional supply.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The principal plantations are
on the estates of Lord Gray and Colonel Duncan of Lun-
die.  Those surrounding the house of Gray, are reckoned
highly beautiful, and certainly do honour to the taste of
that accomplished nobleman, John Lord Gray, by whom
they were laid out.  The district abounds with what is
here called freestone, but in strata; the prevailing colour
is grey, inclining to blue.  Some grey slate has been
found, but very little whinstone.  A proper pier at Inver-
gourie would be of singular advantage for the importation
of lime, and coal which is the principal fuel in this quar-
ter.
