     Statistical Account

   It may be proper in this place to observe, that several years
ago, a remarkable water spout emptied itself, partly on the
lands of Touch, and partly on the lands of Touch-adam.
The water which fell on the lands of Touch, carried off some
cattle, several houses with their furniture.  A few of the inha-
bitants were drowned.  The water which fell on the lands of
Touch adam, directed its course towards the village of St.
Ninians, and carried off a bridge and two houses, together
with a great quantity of earth from the minister's glebe and
some other places.
   No other remarkable phenomena of this kind are talked off,
excepting two shocks of an earthquake, which in one night,
about thirty years ago, were very generally felt in the parish
and neighbourhood.
   There are several mineral springs in the parish; but they
are not at present much frequented.
   We have several merchants who retail the articles of ordi-
nary consumption.
   We have no great manufactories.  Four tanneries employ
about 20 hands.  Four masters employ about 113 hands
in making nails.  One hand works from 1000 to 1200 nails
per day.
   The most considerable manufacture is carried on at Ban-
nockburn.  Of late cotton-cloth, and for a long time, all the
tartan used by the army, has been manufactured at this vil-
lage.
   There are three coal-works in the parish; one at Auchen-
bowie, one at Pleanmuir, one at Bannockburn.  These works
taken together, raise about 600 tons of coal per week.  They
supply the adjacent country, especially to the west: and north,
to a very considerable extent.
   The parish abounds with lime-stone.  At present, however,
it is not wrought to any considerable extent, except at Craig-
