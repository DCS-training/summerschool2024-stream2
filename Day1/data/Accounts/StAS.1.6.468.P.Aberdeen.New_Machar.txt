the 3 residing heritors, and a few of their principal tenants.-
These gentlemen pay particular attention to this pleasing and
advantageous object; oxen reared by them, from 4 to 8 years
old, are sold at from L. 10 to L. 17; and when fattened will
draw from the butcher from L. 18 to L. 25.  The cows are
also well formed, and fell at from L. 9 to L. 12 sterling.-As
the greatest part of the possessions rented in this parish are
small, the tenants can neither afford to raise, nor support cattle
of this description.-The high price at which veal sells in the
Aberdeen market, and the constant demand for that article,
induces the country people to dispose of their calves when 5
or 6 weeks old, by which the breed of cattle is much injured,
and very few more are raised, than what are absolutely neces-
sary for the purposes of agriculture.
