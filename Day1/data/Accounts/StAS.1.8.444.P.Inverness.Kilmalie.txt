strong and ardent.  Instances of such are fresh in the memory
of many living:  and there have been proprietors, who never

for their rents.  Landlords, when indulgent, actually possessed
all the authority and love of a magistrate, of a protector and
a father.  In those days, however, the tenants were ill lodged,

ordinary farm, capable of grazing 1,460 sheep.  If they live in their master's
house, they have, besides their maintenance, grass for 70 sheep.  If the shep-
