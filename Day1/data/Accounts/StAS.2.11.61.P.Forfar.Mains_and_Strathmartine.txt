was every year, to render the operation more complete. Most of
the fields are inclosed with stone dikes and hedges; and the farm-
buildings are in tolerable repair; but it cannot be said, that in the
last twenty years either houses or fences have been in any respect
improved.
	The parish, however, has not suffered so much by the fall in
the price of grain as many others. The great increase and pros-
perity of the town of Dundee has afforded a ready market for
green crops; and there has not been a failure among the tenants
during the existing leases.
        Quarries.-Perhaps there is no part of the country better sup-
plied with stone for every useful purpose than this district. Quar-
ries abound everywhere, furnishing stones well adapted for every
kind of building and inclosure; and if the roads be not in excel-
lent repair, it is not from the want of the best materials.
	In stating the gross amount of the raw produce raised in the
parish, it is not easy to approach to anything like exactness.
The quantity of produce, the price, and mode of cropping, vary in
different years. The following statement, however, may give a
general view of the subject to the reader:-

        Manufactures.-It has already been remarked, that the water
of the Dighty is employed as a powerful auxiliary in the Dundee
manufactures. Every fall that it affords is occupied with ma-
chinery; and three-fourths of the population of the parish are
employed in works that have been established on its banks. There
are four bleachfields, two of which are of great extent, and four
flax spinning-mills; and the machinery of the whole of these,
works is partly driven by steam. Besides the yarn that is clean-
ed at the bleachfield, there are other five mills of inferior con-
struction, where yarn is washed and prepared for the loom. There
