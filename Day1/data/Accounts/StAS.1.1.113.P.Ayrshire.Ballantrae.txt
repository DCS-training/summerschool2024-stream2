improvement and demand for farms in a tenfold degree to 
what it used to be. 

   The shores abound with plenty of fine broad leaved rich
sea-weed or wreck for manure; but there is very little of it
used for kelp on the coast of this parish.  The animals
are those common to the west of Scotland, hares, foxes, rab-
bits, polecats, wild cats, grouse, partridges, plovers, wild
ducks, and wild geese.  The migratory kind observed are the
woodcock, cuckoo, starling, swallow, etc.  Among the mi-
gratory animals may be mentioned the sailfish, which appears
upon this coast the first or second week of June, and conti-
nues for three or four weeks.  They measure from 20 to 30
feet long.  The people of the village kill them with har-
poons for the oil, which is made of the liver.  The liver
of a good fish will yield from 40 to 50 gallons of oil, which
they fell to tanners, etc. and use part of it themselves to burn
in place of candles.

   There are several mineral springs in the parish, which have
been found beneficial in scorbutic and other cutaneous disea-
ses, and in complaints of the stomach arising from acidity
and want of digestion.

   There is no person in the parish connected with the law,
not even a constable or sheriff's officer, nor has there been
any in the memory of the oldest inhabitant.  There is no
justice of peace in the parish, nor within many miles of it;
and the sherrif's court is at the distance of 36 miles.  There
is no surgeon or physician within a dozen miles, and it is
doubtful whether half a dozen such parishes would give bread
to one.
