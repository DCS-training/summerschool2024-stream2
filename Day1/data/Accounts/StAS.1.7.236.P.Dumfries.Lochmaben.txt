Lord of Annandale, before that family came to the crown of
Scotland.  They had other two seats, one at Annan, the o-
ther at Hoddam; and a very great estate, which continued in
their possession long after they came to the crown.  It is said,
that Robert Bruce I. king of Scotland, was born in this cas-
tle.  The ground on which it stood belongs now to Robert
Maxwell, Esq; whose predecessors have been in possession of
it for 200 years, when David MaxwelI their ancestor, was
appointed sub-governor of the Castle of Lochmaben, by
Lord Maxwell, warden of the Western Borders, and keeper
of the said castle.  There are sufficient documents for this
in the hands of the said Robert Maxwell, and in the town
books of Lochmaben.  The said Mr Maxwell, and his pre-
decessors, have been often and long provosts of Lochmaben.

   Castle Loch, and Castle.-The Castle Loch is a large and
beautiful sheet of water, lying south of the town, in length
a mile and a half, and in mean breadth a mile, abounding in
a variety of fish.  It is affirmed by the fishermen, that there
are 15 or 16 different kinds fit for the table, among which
there is one that, from every information that can be obtain-
ed, is peculiar to that loch, as it is to be found no where else
in Britain.  It is called the Vendise or Vendace, some say from
Vendois in France, as being brought from thence by one of
the Jameses, which is not very probable, as it is found by ex-
perience to die the moment it is touched, and has been at-
tempted to be transported to other lochs in the neighbour-
hood, where it has always died.  It is generally about the
size of a small herring, which it resembles much in external
appearance and in its anatomy; it has the taste and flavour
of a fresh herring, not quite so strong, but more delicate, and
is reckoned, the most delicious fish that swims.  They lie in
the deepest parts of the loch, and are caught with a net.
