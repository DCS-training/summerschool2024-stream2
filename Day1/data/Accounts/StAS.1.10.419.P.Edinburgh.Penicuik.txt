     NUMBER XXX.

     PARISH OF PENNYCUICK.

     (Presbytery of Dalkeith.-Synod of Lothian and Tweed-
     dale.-County of Midlothian.)

     By the Reverend Mr THOMAS M'COURTY.

     Name.

   IN old writings the name of the parish is Pennycook, now
commonly Pennycuik, said to signify in Gaelic Gouk's
(or Cuckoo's) Hill, probably from the number of these birds
that haunt the surrounding woods in spring.  It was the opi-
nion of the late worthy Sir James Clerk, that a former pro-
prietor, principal heritor of the parish, gave it this name
after his own; but that the original one was St Mungo's, (in
Norwegian Dear Friend,) the name given to St Kentigern by
Servanus, Bishop of Orkney, by whom he was educated about
the middle of the 6th century*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*There is a well in the minister's garden, near the church,
called St Mungo's well; and in the church yard there is the fol-
lowing inscription upon a grave stone.
