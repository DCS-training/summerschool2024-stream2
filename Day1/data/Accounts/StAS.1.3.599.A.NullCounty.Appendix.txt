BELL, Esq; of Glenriddel, set on foot a species of circulat-
ing library, on a plan so simple, as to be practicable in any
corner of the country; and so useful, as to deserve the no-
tice of every country gentleman, who thinks the improve-
ment of that part of his own species, whom chance has
thrown into the humble walks of the peasant and the arti-
san, a matter worthy of his attention.

   Mr Riddell got a number of his own tenants, and farming
neighbours, to form themselves into a society, for the pur-
pose of having a library among themselves.  They entered
into a legal engagement, to abide by it for 3 years; with a sav-
ing clause or two, in cases of removal to a distance, or of death.
Each member, at his entry, paid 5 s.; and at each of their
meetings, which were held every fourth Saturday, 6 d. more
With their entry money, and the credit which they took on
the faith of their future funds, they laid in a tolerable stock
of books at the commencement.  What authors they were to
purchase, was always to be decided by the majority.  At every
meeting, all the books, under certain sines and forfeitures, by
way of penalty, were to be produced; and the members had
their choice of the volumes in rotation.  He whose name stood,
for that night, first on the list, had his choice of what volume
he pleased in the whole collection; the second had his choice
after the first; the third after the second, and so on to the
last.  At next meeting, he who had been first on the list at
the preceding meeting, was last at this; he who had been
second, was first; and so on, through the whole 3 years.  At
the expiration of the engagement, the books were sold by auc-
tion, but only among the members themselves; and each
man had his share of the common stock, in money or in
books, as he chose to be a purchaser or not.
