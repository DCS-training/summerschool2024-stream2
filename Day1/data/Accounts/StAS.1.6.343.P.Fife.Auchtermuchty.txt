use to his parish in this respect; as within these three years
he ahs raised turnips, potatoes, wheat, and barley on a spot
where they were never before seen in the memory of man.
The crop on that ground this season is surpassed by none in
the country.  There are in the parish only one small slock of
sheep, about 160 horses, and 230 cows, in general of a good
breed.  The parish contains upwards of 3000 acres, 90 of which
are generally appropriated to the raising of flax.  Although
the crop this season promises well, yet for these some years past
it has been very indifferent, which makes it the more to be re-
gretted that the Honourable Board of Trustees should have
curtailed the bounty on that article.  There are about 70 acres
in turnips and cabbage, 150 in wheat, 200 in sown grass, and
160 in pasture; the remainder is occupied in raising oats,
barley and potatoes.  All the waste grounds, to the extent of
between 6 or 700 acres, are planted with fir.  In general
beans and pease are sown in the end of March, oats in April
and barley in the beginning of May.  Considering the back-
warness of the seasons of late, sowing ought to commence
more early; yet some of the old farmers still delay it, alledg-
ing, that they did not begin last year till such a week, or such
a day; as if providence always limited the season to a week or
a day.  The wheat which is sown in the months of September
and October, is generally cut down along with the barley in
the months of August and September following.
   There is marle, but no other kinds of minerals have yet been
discovered.  The gardens produce every necessary vegetable and
root, together with all kinds of common fruits.  A small ri-
vulet flows directly through the town and falls into the river
Eden, a little below the village of Daneshalt, which terminates
the southern part of the parish.
