			KNOCKANDO.                         61

Tuim is supposed to be James Grant, nephew of Carron, frequent-
ly mentioned in a well known publication entitled " The History
of the Troubles and Memorable Transactions in Scotland, by John
Spalding, Commissary-Clerk of Aberdeen." The other cave is
called Bane's Hole, and takes its title from Donald Bane, (White
Donald,) a robber of that name, who is supposed to have been shot
and buried in the immediate neighbourhood.
  Meteorology.-The climate may in general be characterized as
dry and healthy. The temperature is considerably colder than in
the lower and more fertile districts of Moray, resembling rather
the climate of Aberdeen and Banff shires. The west and south.-
west winds are the most powerful and prevalent, frequently con-
tinuing for days and nights in succession, especially during the
winter and spring months of the year. The snow generally re-
mains longer than in the low country, and this may be easily ac-
counted for from the hilly nature of the parish. The warmest
part of the parish is the district between the Spey and the House
of Knockando. At Mill-haugh of Ballintomb and Dalmounach
Cottage, there is frequently calm and warm weather, when. at half
a mile's distance the storm is raging.
The following observations were taken at the House of Wester
Elchies.
