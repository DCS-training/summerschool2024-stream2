Language of the People.-Gaelic is the language generally
spoken by the great body of the common people, particularly the
old ; but almost the whole population, young and old, speak and
understand the English language.  Indeed, in the lower part of
the parish, English is preferred, from its proximity to Inveravon and
Knockando, where no Gaelic is spoken.
  Character of the People.-The inhabitants of the parish are,
on the whole, sober, honest, and industrious. They are remarkable,
in common with the other people of Strathspey, for their
warmth of attachment to their chief; they are uniformly respectful
to those in stations superior to their own, and have seldom been
charged with the commission of crime.  They are, with very few
exceptions, regular in their attendance on religious  ordinances,
and it is hoped that a few among them are decidedly pious.
Smuggling is entirely abandoned by them; but they cannot yet
be altogether acquitted of poaching in game or salmon. Their
ordinary food consists of oat and barley meal, milk and potatoes.

tillage to be deducted from No. 3, and added to No. 1. As to
these, then, it is believed, that about 2500 Scots acres have been

the cultivated part of the parish, with a profitable application of
