of the two leaders who commanded the Fingalian army, Fionn and
Goll.  The former commanded the Irish tribes, the latter the Ca-
ledonian.  In this letter he expresses his sorrow "that his people
paid more attention to the idle tales and songs of Fionn MacCu-
thail and Goll Mac Moirnna than to the word of God."  He
died at Carnassary Castle in the year 1575, and ordered his re-
mains to be deposited in the Priory of Ardchattan, about forty
miles distant from Carnassary.  The day of his interment was
marked by a violent storm, which occasioned much distress to the
great concourse of people who attended the funeral, carrying the
bier on their shoulders, according to the custom of the times; so
that to this day, when there is a tempest of more than ordinary
violence, there is a common saying among the people, "there has
not been the like since Carswell's funeral day."
   After the death of Bishop Carswell, Carnassary Castle became
the property and occasional residence of the Campbells of Auch-
inbreck, one of the most powerful families of their day in the
whole county.  In 1685, Sir Duncan Campbell of Auchinbreck
joined the Earl of Argyle in the unsuccessful invasion of the Duke
of Monmouth, when he entertained the Earl and his followers for
some days at Carnassary Castle.  Not long after the failure of
that unfortunate undertaking, Auchinbreck's estates in this and
the neighbouring parishes were confiscated, and the property be-
longing to himself, his tenants, friends, and vassals, was plundered
by some of the neighbouring clans; as will appear more fully from
the subjoined curious document, one of the rescinded Acts of the
Scottish Parliament. *
