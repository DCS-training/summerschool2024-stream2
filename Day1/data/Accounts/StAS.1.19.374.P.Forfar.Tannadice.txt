Noran, a stream which seeks its way from the hill, to esk.
over a very clear and pebbly bed.  The name of Esk is
common to a number of rivers in Britain; and the reason
is obvious, as it literally signifies water; being the Celtic
word Uisc or Iso, with very little variation.  The manner
in which the people of this country generally speak of the
North Esk evidently respects the meaning of the name;
for they call it the North Water.  It is at least highly
probable that South Esk may be viewed as a classical river,
as the Aesica of the Romans.  In the Itinerary of Richard
of Cirencester, ad Aesicum is mentioned as one of the Ro-
man stations in the province of Vespafiana; and it is mark-
ed as twenty three miles distant from ad Tavum, or one of
their stations on Tay.  Now, although there are remains
of a Roman camp at Kethick, near North Esk, the distance
does not answer; whereas there is a Roman camp at Battle-
dikes, on the other side of the river from Tannadice*.
   The banks of Esk present a variety of delightful and ro-
mantic scenes.  By far the greater part of this parish lies
on the north side of the river.  Here many salmon and sea-
trout used to be catched; but of late years their number is
much diminished.  This is greatly owing to the height of
the dam-dikes erected further down the river.  It is also a
general complaint with those who are fond of fishing, that,
where there are cruives, no regard is paid to the old equi-
table law concerning the Saturday's Sloppe.
   Here, a good number of years ago, a considerable fishing
was carried on in Esk for the fresh water oyster, in order to
procure pearls.  Some of these were so valuable, that L. 4
have been given for one at the first market.  One was got
