     PARISH OF COLMONELL

     (COUNTY OF AYR.)

     By the Rev. MR. JAMES MORCHRIE.

     Origin of the Name.

   COLMONELL or Calmonell, is presumed to be Gaelic
derivation, as the names of many places in this parish
undoubtedly are *.  Some, who pretend to knowledge in that
language, alledge the word signifies a turtle dove, or wood
pigeon, with which, there is reason to believe, the parish for-
merly abounded, and still many of these birds harbour in wood
on the banks of the river Stinchiar.  Or, if conjecture might
take place where no certainty can be obtained, the name may
be derived from St Coleman, one of the popish saints.  There is
a parish in the presbytery of Kintyre, of nearly the same name,
Kilcolmonell; where, as the Gaelic language is better under-
stood, more certain information, as to the etymology and sig-
nification of the name, may perhaps be obtained.
