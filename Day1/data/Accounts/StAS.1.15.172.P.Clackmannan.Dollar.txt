   General Character, etc.-The people are sober, regular, and
industrious in their different prosessions and employments;
and live in peace and harmony with one another.  The com-
mon employment of the women, except such as are engaged
with farmers for husbandry work, is that of spining wool for
the manufacturers in Stirling, Bannockburn, etc.  They all
enjoy, in their respective stations, a reasonable share of the con-
veniences and comforts of life; and some seem well contented
with the condition in which Providence has placed them.
They are much of the ordinary size, and speak the English
language tolerably well, without any remarkable provincial
dialect.
