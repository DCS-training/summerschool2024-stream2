Majority,* 36, of Baptisms more than Burials.

</TABLE>

   There are 3 surgeons, 1 of whom is also a physician,
and 3 writers in the town of Brechin, besides a number
of merchants, shopkeepers, weavers, bakers, smiths
wrights, and the other necessary tradesmen and mechanics.

   Church, Burgh, Fuel, etc.-The church is collegiate.
The King is patron.  There are 5 clergymen, 3 of them
Dissenters.  The livings are widely different in value.
In the time of Episcopacy, the Bishop filled the first
charge.-Brechin is a royal burgh, and one of five that
sends a representative to Parliament.  The election is
vested in the town-council.  It has a weekly market eve-
ry Tuesday.-The fuel used is coals, wood and furze.
Peats are also brought down from the Mearns.  The coals
cost 8 s. per boll at Montrose, sometimes more, besides the
additional charges of carriage, etc.  The duty on this ne-
cessary article, after passing the Redhead, has been long
and justly complained of, as an unequal and partial tax,

<FOOTNOTE>

*This majority would be considerably greater, if all the births in the
parish were registered; but the children of Dissenters are not entered in
the records, and even of those who attend the Established Church, found
neglect to register their children's names.
