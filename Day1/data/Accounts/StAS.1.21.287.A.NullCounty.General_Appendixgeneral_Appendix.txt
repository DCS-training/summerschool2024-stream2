     The Statistical Account.

   It has been objected to canals, that they hurt the coasting
trade, which is so useful a nursery for manning our ships of
war.  By the same mode of reasoning, our West India fleet
should be obliged to visit the Cape of Good Hope, in the
course of their voyage, for the purpose of making more expert
sailors:  As if the arts of peace were not equally entitled to
attention with those of war; as if to enjoy life were not a
national object, no less than merely to preserve it.  To such
objections, one answer seems to be sufficient; that if canals
have a tendency to add to the resources of a country, its in-
dustry, its wealth, and its population, they, in the same pro-
portion, add to its means of defence against foreign enemies.
There objections, however, do not apply to the Lochow Ca-
nal.  It were easy to shew, that it would not only add to the
coasting trade, but that it would likewise become a valuable
nursery for seamen.  The most circuitous navigation cannot,
without a canal, introduce a single vessel to Lochow.  The
proposed canal, therefore, would not in the smallest degree in-
terfere with the coasting trade.  Instead of that, the goods,
which are now procured by an expensive land carriage, would,
in that event, be coasted a considerable distance before they
found their way to tim canal.  The hardy Highlanders of Glen-
urchy and Lochow, who first came from curiosity to gaze at
the mast and the sail, would soon be prevailed upon to ac-
cept of employment on board.  Their ambition would not
rest here.  When they got acquainted with the tars of the
Clyde and the Thames, many of them would join them, in
order to wipe off the ignominy of being considered as fresh
water sailors; and by resigning their old births to a new set,
who would soon tread in the steps of their brethren, the
Lochow Canal would afford a constant and increasing supply
of men to the British navy.
   That this canal would afford a reasonable interest for the
