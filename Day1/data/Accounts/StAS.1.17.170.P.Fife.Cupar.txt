     Statistical Account

   Character of the People.-The labourer and the mechanic
are in general able, by the exertions of their industry, to
make a decent livelihood for themselves and their families;
they possess more foresight and economy than those of the
same rank in the neighbouring kingdom.  They cherish the
laudable pride of not being indebted for their support to the
parochial fund, or to the humanity of the charitable.  They
are in general contented with their humble situation; friends
to that government which extends protection and security
to their dwellings; and have had the good sense to resist
and to despise the attempts of those, who have endeavoured
to make them believe, in opposition to their own happy ex-
perience, that they are burdened, oppressed, and wretched.

   Manners.-The manners of the inhabitants of Cupar, of
better rank, are, in general, correct and polite.  Gentlemen
of the military profession, having spent their youth in the ser-
vice of their country, frequently fix their residence here, in the
decline of life.  Formed in that school, which has long been
distinguished by the ease and politeness which it communi-
cates, they have contributed to diffuse an elegance of man-
ners.  To this circumstance also, perhaps, it is in some mea-
sure owing, that families residing in Cupar, and enjoying on-
ly a limited and narrow income, make a decent and respec-
table appearance; and are enabled, by habits of attention
and economy, frequently to exercise an elegant hospitality.
