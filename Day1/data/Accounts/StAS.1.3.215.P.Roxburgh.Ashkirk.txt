   Since the year 1755, the inhabitants have decreased about
90 souls; in Dr Webster's report the number being 629.
The people of this parish are industrious, frugal, temperate,
and devout.

   Fuel.-The fuel principally used is peat or turf, which
are not abundant.  The more wealthy parishioners bring
coals, for the use of their families, from Lothian, or from
the English borders.  The places whence these coals are pro-
cured are about 30 miles distant from Ashkirk.

   Poor.-The number of poor who stand upon the roll of
the parish is 10; they are maintained by assessments, and
the weekly collections in the church.  The heritors assess
themselves in a certain sum, to be raised in proportion to
their valued rents.  The proprietor pays one half, the tenant
the other, and the distribution is made quarterly.
