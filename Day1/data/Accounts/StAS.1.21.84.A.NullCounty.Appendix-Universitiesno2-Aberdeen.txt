sponsible for the progress and improvement of his pupil, is
particularly interested in his attainments, zealous to convey
important and useful instruction, and to fix solid and virtu-
ous principles.  Nevertheless, the College impressed with a
sense of the importance and extent of the sciences, which
thus alternately devolve on the same person, and considering
that in the present state of knowledge, it is not probable he
can attain eminence in each, whatever his assiduity or talents
may be; has, as a preparatory step towards farther improve-
ment (if it shall be found such,) resolved to fix for a time the
mathematical class.
   Though the method of teaching and arrangement of sub-
jects adopted by each professor must necessarily vary to a cer-
tain degree, yet that generally practised in this University,
seems well calculated to lead the minds of youth in a natural
progression to the attainment of useful science.  The profes-
sors in the philosophical department teach three hours every
day of the week, except Saturday and Sunday; on Sunday
they, as well as the professor of Greek, lecture one hour on
some subject connected with natural theology.

   Semi Class.-The second year of the academical course
is employed in teaching the elements of the mathematical
sciences.  The students are supposed to be previously ac-
quainted with the art of computation as taught at our
schools; they are now instructed in the theory of numbers
and the foundation of the rules of arithmetic.  Algebra,
the elements of plane and solid geometry, trigonometry,
mensuration of plane surfaces and solids, with spherics, are
included in the business of this year.  The professor gives
occasional lectures on geology and the meteorological bran-
ches of natural history.
