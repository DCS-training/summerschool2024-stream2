principal manufactures are sail-cloth, Oznaburghs, and other
brown linens.  From November 1790, to November 1791,
1,055,303 yards of the two last were manufactured in the
town and stamp-office district, which extends about 6 or 8
miles round the town, equal in value to 39,660 l. 6 s. 10 d.
There is likewise yearly manufactured in the town, sail-cloth
to the same amount; and nearly 500 looms are employed.
The greatest part of the linen and sail-cloth is shipped for
London.  A small part is sent to Glasgow and Dandee.
The principal imports are flax and hemp from Ruffia, and
wood and iron from Norway and Sweden.  Of the two first,
there were imported last year from 700 to 800 tons; and
wood and iron to the value of 4000 l.  A very considerable
trade is likewise carried on in lime and coals.  Of the for-
mer, there are unloaded at the harbour about 18,000 bolls of
shells; and from 6000 to 8000 tons of the latter yearly.
This quantity will not seem so great, when it is considered
that this town not only supplies its own neighbourhood, but
sends a great quantity of coals to Forfar, Brechin, and their
neighbourhood.  A repeal of the coal-tax would consider-
ably affect the revenue of this town, and be a loss to indi-
viduals, who deal solely in the coal-trade; yet the people are
not so selfish as to throw any obstacle in the way of a repeal,
so ardently desired by their northern neighbours, nor so
blind to their own interest as to solicit its abolition.  About
18,000 bolls of barley are yearly shipped here, and the trades
import about 3000 bolls of oat-meal.-There is a tan-yard,
which employs 6 men; and hides are yearly dressed, to the
value of 2500 l.  During the late wars, and some time prior
to it, a great number of shoes were exported; but, since the
peace, that trade has almost, if not entirely failed.  A short
time ago, a cotton manufactory was established, which em-
ploys 18 men, women, and children.  Yarn is spun to the
