             I--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.--This parish is supposed, by some, to have derived its
name from its vicinity to the Cairn-o-Mount, a part of the Gram-
pian mountains, over which the public road to Aberdeenshire
passes, and to which it begins to ascend, at a small distance, to the
north of the village.
   Extent and Boundaries.--The parish of Fettercairn forms the ex-
treme western division of Kincardineshire, on the south side of the
Grampians. It length, from south to north, is 8 miles, and its gre`test
breadth, from east to west, 4 1/2. It contains about 13,192 imperial
acres, or about 20 square miles of surface. It is bounded on the north
and north-east, by the parish of Fordoun; on the east and south-
east, by the parish of Marykirk; on the south and south-west, by
Part of the parish of Marykirk, and the river North Esk; and on
the west and north-west, by part of the parish of Edzell and the
Grampian mountains, which separate it, from the parish of Stra-
chan, in that direction.
