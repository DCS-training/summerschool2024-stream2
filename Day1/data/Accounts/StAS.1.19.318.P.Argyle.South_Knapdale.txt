must be confessed, however, that though the druidical tem-
ples be frequent in Argyleshire, and commonly met with
in plains like this, yet not the least vestige of any is to be
seen here.
   The following couplet has been handed down by the ge-
nealogist of this place:

     Colonel, Clan A gorry, Barry, Clan Murachie,
     Mac Charmaig, Clan Neill, Martin, Clan Donachie.

   It is adduced in evidence that Saints Colmonel, Barry,

an intercessory character; and, as the same of modest merit
rarely extends to a distance, there is cause to believe that
