stocks of sheep are in the parish.  The farmers, however,
generally keep as many as supply them with wool and
mutton for their families.  About a third of the arable
land is commonly in crop, where the land is leased for til-
lage.  The farmers, after marling or liming grounds that
have been well rested, take a crop, sometimes two, of bar-
ley or bear, then a crop or two of oats, and with the third
or fouth crop lay down with rye-grass and clover; but in
general only for pasture.  The dung is either laid upon
their lee-lands, before they break them up, or is used for
raising potatoes, which are now generally horse-hoed,
unless where new ground is to be taken in by planting
them is lazy beds.  Considerable quantities are exported
to Whitehaven, Liverpool, and sometimes even to London.
Very few of our farmers raise turnips or cabbages; the
reason probably is our distance from any considerable mar-
ket for stall-fed cattle.  Hardly any wheat is sown in this
parish.  There is either in the soil or in the climate, more
probably in the latter, something unfriendly to that grain.
Even when tried by our best farmers, it has always pro-
ved of a very inferior quality.  It often smuts, and our
harvest is generally too rainy to save it well.  The parish
does much more than supply itself with provisions.  Be-
sides what it sends to the neighbouring markets of Wigton
and Newtonstewart, it exports considerably, chiefly to
Whitehaven and Liverpool, but sometimes also to Clyde,
barley, bear and oats; and sends yearly to England, from
30 to 35 score of bullocks to the St Faith's and Hampton
markets.  These bullocks are not all reared in the parish,
but are all grazed in it for a year or 6 months, before they
are driven to England.  The time of sowing oats general-
ly commenceth about the 10th March, and that of reaping
about the 10th August.  No grounds lie waste or in com-
mon.  We have no natural wood, and not much planta-
