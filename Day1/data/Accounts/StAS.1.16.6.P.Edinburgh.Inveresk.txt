this chapel, which must have been of considerable dimen-
sions.  The old steps of the stair, which was repaired not
long since, were the bafes of the pillars of this chapel,
according to the report of masons still living.  This is
said to have been the first religious house in Scotland,
whose ruins were applied to an unhallowed use*, for
which the good people of Musselburgh are said to have
been annually excommunicated, till very lately, at Rome.
   History assures us, that RANDOLF Earl of Murray died
in Musselburgh of the stone, in July 1332, and tradition
points out the house where he died, near the east end of the
town, on the south side.  It is a vaulted house, of two rooms
on the ground floor; the rooms are about 14 feet square,
and the arch 8 feet high, with a passage between them 6
feet wide.  This might well have been the best house in
the town 460 years ago+.  Tradition also says, that the
inhabitants having formed a guard round the house, during
the illness of this great man, they found such favour with
the Earl of Mar, the succeeding regent, that he granted, or
obtained for them, their first charter.
   In this parish lies the field of the battle of Pinkie++, which
was fought in the year 1547, when Queen Mary was an
infant, with such disadvantage to the Scots.

*Till about 30 years ago there was a middle row of houses eastward
from the Tolbooth, one of which had been a chapel, called Chapel Gavel.
There were various other old chapels in different situations; one in a
garden in the west end of Market-gate, and one in New Hailes grounds,
called Magdalene Chapel, near to Magdalene Bridge, of which there are
now no remains; besides an alms-house in Market-gate, which is now a
dwelling-house.
