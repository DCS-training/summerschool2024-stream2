			PARISH OF INVERKEILOR.

	 PRESBYTERY OF ARBROATHS, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

	        THE REV.  ALEXANDER CARNEGIE, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HRSTORY.
	Name.--IT appears from a charter describing the lands of Boy-
sack, that the ancient name of this parish was Conghoillis. The
name Inverkeilor describes the situation of the parish at the mouth
of the Keilor,--a rivulet which empties itself into the sea about a
mile south from the village, at the southern terminathon of the bay
of Lunan.
	Extent and Boundaries.--The parish is of an oblong form, ex-
tending from the sea westward about 7 mile. Its greatest
breadth is from Gighty burn, its north boundary, to the bold rocky
shore that bounds the land on the south, about 4 1/2 miles. It gra-
dually becomes narrower as it extends westward, and its medium
breadth may be about 2 1/2 miles.
	Topographical Appearances.-- It is in general pretty level, ex-
cept on the north side of the river Lunan, from which the ground
rises, forming a gently sloping bank of good arable land; and
from the south side of the Keilor the ascent is gradual till it ter-
minates in the high rocky coast, where there is a remarkable pro-
montory, the Redhead, 45 fathoms in height. It is seen at a great
distance from sea, and abounds with a variaty of sea-fowls. The
