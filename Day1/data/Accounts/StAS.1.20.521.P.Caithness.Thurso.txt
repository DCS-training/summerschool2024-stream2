   SECT V.  Harbours and Dues.-The harbours of Thurso
and Wick are the only places deserving of the name on the
coast of Caithness; and even these, in their present state,
are but indifferent harbours, though capable of being made
good ones at no great expence, particularly that of Thurso.
In its present state, it admits vessels of 10 feet draughts of
water at stream-tides, and after getting in over the bar they
lie in perfect safety; but for want of a peir of breast-work

   SECT. VII.  Banks.-The first Banking Company that
