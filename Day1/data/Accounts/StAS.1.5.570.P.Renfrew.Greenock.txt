     Statistical Account

   Population.-From the best calculation that can now be
made of the number of inhabitants in the year 1745, they 
did not exceed 4000 in both parishes.  Ten years later,
they had rather decreased, the return to Dr Webster in
1755 being, from the old parish, 1886
and from the new,                1972  In all only 3858.
   But about the year 1760, the town began to increase ra-
pidly and continued to do till the American war, which
occasioned almost an entire stagnation of its trade.  Imme-
diately, however, on the peace in 1783, trade revived, and
Greenock is now in a much more flourishing state, than it
was at any period previous to that unfortunate contest;
containing in all no fewer than 15,000 souls.  From the re-
gister of the Old Parish of Greenock, is extracted the fol-
lowing list marriages and births*, for 10 years preceeding
January 1791:
