   The greatest flood in the Dee, within the memory of
man, was in the year 1768.  But although the river rose
to an amazing height, it did not reach any of the houses,
even in the street called the Green, which is the lowest and
only part of the town that appears to be in any danger
from inundations or land-floods.  But the haughs on both
sides of Don and Dee are subject to them, and have some-
times suffered considerably.

   In 1281, Henry Cheyne (nephew of John Comyn, who
was killed by Robert Bruce at Dumfries in 1305) suc-
ceeded to the bishoprick of Aberdeen.  After Comyn's
death, Bishop Cheyne, (from his being so near a relation to
Comyn), as well as many others in Scotland, were greatly
enraged at Robert Bruce, upon account of Comyn's deaths
and openly espoused the interest and party of the Comyns.
For this reason, after Bruce became settled in the throne-
and government, Bishop Cheyne was obliged to fly into
England, and remain there for several years, during which
time the revenues of this bishoprick remained unapplied.
But King Robert having been afterwards reconciled to Bi-
shop Cheyne, was pleased to allow him to return, and pos-
sess the fee of Aberdeen as formerly.  The bishop was so
happy, upon his being again received into the King's fa-
vour, that, upon his return home, he, with the concur-
rence and approbation of his Sovereign, applied the whole
rents of his bishoprick, which, during his absence in Eng-
land, had accumulated to a considerable sum towards build-
ing the bridge over Don of one large Gothic arch, where
it now stands, upon the great high road leading northward
from Aberdeen, and it appears to have been built about the
year 1320.  Bishop Cheyne died in 1329.
