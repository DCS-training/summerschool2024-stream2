it imbibes and accumulates from the atmosphere the elementary
matter which forms the principal ingredient in their composition.
The rest enjoyed by pasture lands is, in a great measure, to be con-
sidered then, rather as the occasion than the cause of their im-
proved fertility: the true cause of the improvement in ques-
tion being that, by the process of depasturing, the formation or at
least the maturing of seeds is prevented, and time, therefore, allow-
ed for the accumulation in the soil of their constituent elements.
A principal ingredient in the composition of seeds has been found
by the experiments of Sir Humpbrey Davy and others to be nitro-
gen, which substance, it has been further ascertained by Liebig
and his coadjutors, is communicated to the soil in sensible quanti-
ties, through the medium of rain water, snow, &c.  These are evi-
dently important facts, and seem to promise that the farmer will
soon be able, by means of artificial manures, to infuse into the
soil that peculiar virtue in respect of the filling and maturing of
the ears of grain, of which in the meantime, the rest allowed by a
course of depasturing continued for several successive years is held
to be, if not the efficient cause, at least the almost exclusive oc-
casion.  That the frequent stirring of the soil is not, per se, calcu-
lated to exert an impoverishing influence, and hence that the su-
perior productiveness of pasture lands when first broken up after a
long period of rest, is not to be ascribed to the mere element of
rest taken by itself, is demonstrated by the fact, that the produc-
tive powers of soils are in every instance increased by subjecting
them to the process of summer fallowing.  The increased powers
of fertility ascertained to result from this process of summer fal-
lowing seem again to direct our attention to the nutritive matter
which the soil in favourable circumstances is capable of extracting
from the atmosphere, and hence to give probability to the hypo-
thesis that such an analysis as shall detect the nutritive atmospheric
matter thus extracted, may discover to the farmer an available me-
thod of enriching his fields by the addition of the same matter
through the medium of artificial manures.  The value of such a
discovery would be very great, indeed, as even the seven shift is
found in many cases to be of an exhaustive character; the crops
of successive rotations under it becoming, notwithstanding plenti-
ful supplies of common manure, less and less productive.  To re-
medy this evil of decreasing productiveness, some of our best far-
mers have adopted what is called the six shift, according to which,
