than 50 years*.  Innoculation has been practiced here, and
many submitted to it thankfully, when strongly recommend-
ed to them some years ago; but for some time past it seems
to have been forgotten

   Mode of Living.-The inhabitants of this parish are in gene-
ral industrious, quiet and sober; some of them very intelligent
in their professions; many of the better sort live exceeding-
ly well; their tables are abundantly supplied with every ne-
cessary, and some with the luxuries of life.  In general,
the farmers are well lodged, and both they and their fami-
lies are well dressed.  The lesser farmers and manufacturers
also live well, and have plenty of good wholesome food;
many of them are supplied with butcher-meat at times; and
both they and the labourers, not only use oat-meal and po-0
tatoes, with the produce of their yards or gardens, but they
frequently use wheaten bread, the consumption of which
has increased much within these few years, and there are
vert few who have families, who do not use tea and its
accompanyments.

   Farm Servants.-The farm servants formerly lived with
the family; and their usual food was broth made of kait
and barley, or grotts, (unhusked oats), without meat, and
bannocks made of pease and bean meal.   Now they live
apart from the family in their bothie, and get what is call-
led livery meal, i. e. w peeks of oat-meal per week, and
3 choppins (quarts) of skimmed milk per day.

*The Author of this paper is Happy in this opportunity of paying a just
tribute to so worthy a character.  During a ministry of 50 years and up-
wards, besides a very conscientious discharge of his duty in his official capa-
city, his charity, benevolence, and attention to the poor, made him extreme-
ly useful and much beloved.  His character was irreproachable; he was
so sincere Minister of the Gospel; a good Christian; and an honest man.
