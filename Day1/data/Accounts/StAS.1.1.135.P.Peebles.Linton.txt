being unprofitable, the least possible number of them is kept.
From 40 to 50 ewes are generally allotted to one ram through
Tweeddale, according to the poorness or richness of the pas-
ture.  An old fat breeding ewe from the hill grounds weighs
from 6 to 8 pounds avoirdupoise per quarter, yielding from 4
to 8 pounds of Tallow.

   The Tweeddale wool is in general coarse, and sells at pre-
sent, if the sheep are washed, at an average of 6 s. per stone
Tron.  It used formerly to go all to Stirling for carpets, shal-
loons, etc.; but of late it is bought much by Hawick people:
part is sent to Hawick, part to Leith, where it is shipped for 
England.  Atttempts have been made in Tweeddale, and in
similar grounds in Annandale, to improve the wool, by the
introduction of Bakewell rams; but it is universally given up;
the breed produced being, as is reported, a soft dull animal,
always loitering in low grounds, unwilling to climb heights,
and too spiritless to remove the snow with its feet to obtain
food in winter.  The chief food of the sheep in winter is the
grass which in summer they reject, and allow to grow to its
proper height.  The common breed here is a short tailed com-
pact bodied sheep, with black faces and legs.  The sheep are
all smeared at Martinmas with a mixture of tar and train oil,
or Orkney butter.  Butter is preferred to train oil.

   A stone and an half of butter, and 12 Scots pints of Norway
tar, is reckoned, in general, the dose for 80 old sheep; 1 1/4
stones of butter, and 12 pints of tar, is the dose for 50 year
olds, or 60 two year olds.  John Murray farmer in Buccam,
in the parish of Galashiels, says, that when in Elibank, in Sel-
kirkshire, he was unsuccessful in his competition for the pre-
mium granted for wool; he next season smeared entirely with
butter without tar, and easily gained the premium.  The
