in proper repair, though in the course of a few years
these mortgages will be extinguished, the by roads finished,
and both kept in high order.-The most of the bridges
were executed in the same way, by the heritors advan-
cing the payment to the undertakers, till such time as
the funds admitted of their being reimbursed; but their 
trouble and outlays were in some measure compensated by
the enjoyment of these roads, and the beneficial effects of
them to the district, which they saw and experiented.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The parish has been
considerably meliorated by the roads.  The fuel mostly
used is peats, which, though plentiful in general, are very
scarce in some places, and in others quite exhausted; so
that the parish is much obliged, and will be highly benefit-
ed by the strenuous and spirited exertion of Mr Dundas in
bringing about the repeal of the duty upon coals carried
coastways.  Were the duty upon salt also taken off, it would
contribute to the general advantage.  The tract of the in-
tended canal between Lochgilp and Crinan runs a consider-
able way by the west skirt of the parish; whatever may
be the advantages of this arduous undertaking to the public,
it is probable, that during the execution of the work, this
and the neighbouring parishes may reap some benefit.
