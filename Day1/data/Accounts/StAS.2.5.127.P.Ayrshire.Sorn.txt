north-east boundary of the parish, from whose summit, which has
been rated at about 1500 or 1600 feet above the level of the sea,
there is in clear weather a very extensive view; some individuals
maintaining that no less than sixteen counties may be seen from it.
The scenery along the banks of the Ayr is remarkably picturesque,
and is peculiarly so about Sorn Castle and the manse.
	Meteorology.--The climate may in general be characterized as
healthy, although, as in the greater part of the west of Scotland,
there are frequent and heavy falls of rain. The prevailing winds
are the west and south-west. Snow seldom falls to any consider-
able depth, and when it doer fall, remains only a very short time
upon the ground.
	The following extract for the last three years from a meteoro-
logical table kept at the Catrine works may serve to convey a very
accurate idea of the climate:--
