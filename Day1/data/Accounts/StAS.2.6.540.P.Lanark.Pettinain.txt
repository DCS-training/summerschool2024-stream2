                              III.-POPULATION.

       The population of the parish does not appear to have varied
very materially for a considerable period of time. It is stated to
have been on the decrease when the last Account was given, but
at present the number is considerably greater than that formerly
given, the total population by the last census being 461. Of these
117 reside in the village of Pettinain, and the remaining 344 are
scattered throughout the parish.

        Character of the People.-The habits of the people are cleanly,
and a good deal of attention is paid to neatness of dress. Their
ordinary food is porridge, made of oatmeal, for breakfast; broth with
beef or pork, or butter and cheese to dinner; and porridge or po-
tatoes, according to the season of the year, to supper. The peo-
ple, in general, are happy and contented with their situation, and
may be characterized as quiet and sensible, industriuos, and regu-
larin their attendance on Divine ordinances. Poaching is not
often practised, except among the pheasants, and in those cases
where the poachers have been detected, they have been found to
be individual from other parishes. There is no smuggling or
pawnbroking carried on in parish.
