   This is the amount of the stipend of Westray, as given in
by the present incumbent's predecessor to the Court of
Session, as far back as the year 1773, when he commenced
a process of augmentation against the heritors of Westray;
and in the month of August 1777, he obtained from the
Court a decreet of modification, decerning and ordaining the
stipend of Westray and Papa Westray to have been for crop
and year of God 1773, since syne and in time coming, 36
miels 3 settins of bear, 4 miels 2 settins of malt, 4 meils
oat-meal, and 2 1/2 barrels of butter, with L. 551: 17: 4
Scots, and L. 33 : 6 : 8 Scots, for furnishing the commu-
nion-elements.  It appears, therefore, by this state, that the
stipend of Westray, by the above decree of modification, is
L. 778 : 13 : 4 Scots, and reckoning along with this the
value of the glebes, and a little kelp burnt by the minister,
the stipend of Westray may be about L. 70 Sterling com-
munibus annis.  But after all this account of stipend, it
must be understood, that there is no decreet of locality past
on the decreet of modification, in which case, all this aug-
mentation, which amounts to L. 19 : 3 : 9 Sterling per an-
num, remains in the heritors hands, ten years of which be-
long to the present incumbent, and the other ten years
augmentation to the last incumbent's heirs.  From the
above account, the stipend of Westray is in a very ruinous
dilapidated state at present, nor will it be easy for the pre-
