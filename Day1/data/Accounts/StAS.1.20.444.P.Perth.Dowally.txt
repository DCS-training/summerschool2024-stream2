     MISCELLANEOUS FACTS.

   Houses, in Dunkeld, sell at 20 years purchase.  The
real rent of the town is nearly L.1000 Sterling.  The va-
lue, therefore, is nearly L.20,000.  Several new houses
have been lately built.
   A committee of the inhabitants fix an yearly assessment,
which amounts, at an average, to L.8 Sterling, for repair-
ing the streets and avenues of the town.
   In 1648, Sir James Galloway, Master of Requests to
James VI. and Charles I. was created Lord Dunkeld*.
His grandson James was attained at the Revolution, and
dying at he beginning of this century, the title became ex-
tinct.
   Dunkeld is a barony, and its only magistrate a baron-
bailie, appointed by the Duke of Atholl.  Charles II. of-
fered a charter of erection into a royal borough.  The offer
was refused.
