Strathblane, Kilpatrick, and Dumbarton: Mr Buchanan of
Carbeth, Mr Stirling of Craigbarnet, and Sir John Stirling of
Glorat, possess, each of them, likewise landed property in
other parishes; of this property there are 2260 pounds Scots
entailed, and in all probability there will be more added by
the present proprietors.  The small proprietors are feuers of
the families of Montrose, Keer, Glorat, and Bardowie, and

of land is so very backward in this district; wherever fami-
lies resided long upon an estate in Scotland, the object of our
Scotch ambition was to possess a numerous tenantry, live as

situation, than by the flow returns of agricultarc; whereas,
