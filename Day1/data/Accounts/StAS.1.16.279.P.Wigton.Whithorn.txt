   The face of the country is improving daily, not only
by the cultivation bestowed upon the land, but by a
passion for planting which shews itself among the land-
holders.  From the subterraneous timbers found in all
the mosses, it appears, that this peninsula had been once
well clothed with oaks, firs, etc.  It was afterwards ren-
