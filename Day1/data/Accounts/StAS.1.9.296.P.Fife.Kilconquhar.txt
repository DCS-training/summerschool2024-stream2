south, commanding a noble view of the coast, and of the
frith of Forth; a pleasant and grand object, beautifully
winding round the coast, almost in a semicircular direction,
often agreeably diversified with ships of various burdens,
and sometimes with fleets; North Berwick law, the Bass,
and the island of May, are also pleasing and grand objects
from this charming villa, appearing as so many floating
islands and castles in the sea.  Balcarras commands an ex-
tensire prospect on the south of the frith likewise, com-
prehending Edinburgh, with a great part of the counties of
Lothian, Haddington, Berwick, etc.  There is a beautiful
craig on the East of Balcarras-House, rising in the midst of
rich fields, from which the objects above mentioned are
seen to great advantage.  Here also is an excellent quarry
for building.  On the east of the craig is a delightful den,
about an English mile in length, enlivened by a stream of
water passing through the middle, whose rising banks are
adorned with thriving trees of various kinds.  The feather-
ed tribes seem proud of pouring forth their various melody
in this pleasant retreat, not inferior perhaps to the Tempe
of ancient Thessaly.  Balcarras is no less fertile than beauti-
ful, the fields are properly divided and inclosed, and in the
highest state of cultivation.  The late Earl of Balcarras,
a nobleman distinguished by the benevolence of his heart,
the liberality of his sentiments, and the uncommon extent
of his knowledge, particularly in history and agriculture,
was among the first that brought farming to any degree of
perfection in this country.
