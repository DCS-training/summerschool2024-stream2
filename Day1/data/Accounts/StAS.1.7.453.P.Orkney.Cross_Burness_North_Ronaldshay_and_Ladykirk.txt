think incredible.  The soil in the isle of North Ronaldshay
is also sandy, but has a greater mixture of red clay.

   Air.-The air is rather moist and raw, which, by obstruc-
ting the perspiration, often occasions colds.-The most pre-
vailing distempers are colds, colics, cutaneous eruptions, scor-
butic complaints, and rheumatisms, which last the people
generally call the gout: All which probably proceed from
cold and wet clothes.  There are some instances of the scro-
phula, or King's evil, and 2 or 3 persons afflicted with the
white swelling.  Fevers sometimes prevail; and, when they
seize one person in a house, they often affect the whole fa-
mily.  Relapses are frequent, as they are not at pains to
wash the bed-clothes when they have recovered.-The sea
coasts of the isle of Sanday may be about 12 leagues or more;
that of North Ronaldshay 2 or 3 leagues.  The shore is ge-
nerally flat and sandy in both islands, especially on the east
coasts.

   Fish.-The fish caught are cod, ling, skate, holybut;-but

fish here called cuths, of the size of small haddocks, and is
the same with what on the south coast is called podley, only
the cuth is of a larger size.  The inhabitants eat them; and
they produce oil for household use.  No fish of any kind, or
oil are exported to any foreign market; the people being em-
ployed in making kelp during the summer season, have not
time for fishing.  Lobsters are caught, and brought to the
London market by smacks; but none of the people of these
two islands are employed in catching them, for the reason al-
ready mentioned.  The foresaid grey fish are caught from
the middle of summer, to the beginning of spring.  The seal
frequents there shores, but not in great number.  The otter
