cepted, the plantations along the small water Leet are not as
yet of age.  There are no natural woods, forests, waste or
common grounds. Near Tweed on this side, and still more
remarkably on the opposite bank, as far as the Chiviot, and 
the ranges of hill contiguous to it, the want of trees attests the
border desolations.  Plants in far greater variety are to be
found in the lower parts of Clydesdale and Renfrewshire
than in this parish and its neighbourhood.  This part of the
Merse and downwards along the Tweed, is not a rich field for
a botanical journey.  Husbandry is well understood in the
Merse.  By the Merse I do not mean the shire of Berwick.
That shire consists of three parts: 1. Lauderdale; 2. that
ranga of hills which, under different names, extends west-
ward from the head of Leader water, to the sea below the
town of Berwick; and 3. that track of country which is
situated between those hills and Tweed.  That charming and
fertile track is properly the Merse, Lauderdale excepted.
The parish supplies itself in provisions, and sends cattle and
corn to other markets.  We have an early harvest, and the
sowing of the crops is adjusted to this.  The gross rent of the
parish may be about L. 6000 Sterling a year or more.
The rent of fishing is L. 93
