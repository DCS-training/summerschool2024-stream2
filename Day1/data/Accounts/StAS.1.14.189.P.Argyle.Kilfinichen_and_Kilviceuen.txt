     Of Kilfinichen and Kilviceuen.

1791, a space near 9 years, was 46 souls.  The po-
pulation of the rest of the parish, paricularly Ross, in-
creased in the same proportion*.  The incumbent got
the inhabitants numbered in February 1791; the re-
turn was 3002.  This return must have been exact, as
the name of every person was written down.  In such
an extensive parish, where the incumbent could not exa-
mine every person upon the spot, the different ages
could not be ascertained; only in the island of I, where
the schoolmaster marked the particular ages of the in-
habitants, 323 in number, and are as follows:  Under
10 years of age, 79; between 10 and 20, 73; between
20 and 50, 138; between 50 and 60, 23; between 60
and 70, 5; 80, 2; 85, 2; above 100, 1.  Of these are
155 females, and 168 males.-In Ross, where there are
1240 souls, there are 27 persons from 80 to 90 years of 
age, and 11 from 90 to 100.  The precentor is about
81, and a tailor by trade; he is still stout and healthy.
The bellman is about 80; he was twice married, and
went with his children by the second marriage, 5 in

*The reason of the increase of population in this parish is common
to it with the rest of the Hebrides.  Few leave the country, if they
can procure a house, which is easily built, with a spot of ground for crop,
and a cow's grass.  All marry young, and being healthy, their progeny
is numerous.  The parents also, that their children might settle in the
country, and near them, often share their lands with them, whether
male or female.  There is another reason why population should increase
upon the Duke of Argyll's property.  From his estate, small tenants are
never removed, while they behave properly.  It is no secret in the coun-
try, that his Grace continued their farms to small tenants, at the former
rent, though large augmentations were offered by gentlemen who were
better able, and would pay their rents more punctually.  From the same
principle of humanity, it has also happened often, that his Grace, though
with loss of rent, ordered farms to be divided into small portions, to ac-
commodate numbers that would otherwise be destitute, and obliged, 
with weak and helpless families, to leave the country.
