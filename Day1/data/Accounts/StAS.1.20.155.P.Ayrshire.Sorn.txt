and so great was the demand, that, could it have been pre-
pared, we could have sold double that quantity.  We have
contracted with workmen for raising 20,000 next season.
As the quantity brought to market varies, the number of
hands must vary in proportion.  A good workman will, in a
year, raise 500 tons, equal to 2000 bolls; but as little can
be done in winter, you may reckon a man for every 1000
bolls, beside those employed in bearing and in carting the
lime and coals to the draw-kiln.  The bare, which, 18
years ago, was only 15 feet, is now 30.  This circumstance
has, of late, obliged us to have recourse to the expedient of
mining the rock, which consists of about 7 feet thick, in so
many beds; with a roof of hard till 18 inches thick.  This
stratum of till, with 10 feet of blaze over it, makes a good
roof, and allows us to work the mine from 16 to 20 feet
wide, leaving pillars about 18 feet square.  When I enter-
ed upon this work, the wages of the workmen, both above
and below, were from 9d. to 14d. per day: they are now
from 14 d. to 2 s.  This lime-stone has been worked 80
years.  It is carried to the neighbouring parishes of Auch-
inleck, Ochiltree, Mauchline, and Stair, to the distance of 10
or 12 miles.
   "When I came to this place, there were only about 6
men employed at the colliery; their wages 14 d. per day,
and their out-put 10 loads per man: sp;d at 3 1/2 d. per load.
Without including those employed in drawing to the bank,
the number now employed at our colliery, and the adjacent
one of Burnhead, will average about 20; their out-puts
from 12 to 15 loads per day, per man, sold at 6 d.  Their
wages are from 2 s. to 2 s. 6 d.  The main seam is about
8 feet thick, with 6 inches of fire clay in the middle.  Im-
mediately above this seam, there is a stratum of the same
kind of clay, 18 inches thick; above this 18 inches of coal;
then 20 inches of hard black slate; and over that near 3 feet
