tops of high, steep, and rugged mountains, that they are
carried to the houses at a very great expence.  At the same
time, the great distance from the Low Country, and the
crossness of the navigation, render the freight of coal very
high; but, as if these natural disadvantages were not suffi-
ciently distressing, the coals are subjected to a very heavy
duty.  Whatever may have been the original cause of this
tax, it is astonishing, that the Legislature of a free and en-
lightened nation, should have so long continued a duty so
oppressive and partial, and which so directly counteracts e-
very attempt that can be made to improve those remote parts
of the kingdom.

   The want of inclosures is another very great disadvantage,
in all parts of the parish.  In a country which is not calcu-
lated for raising corn, and where provender is very scarce,
green crops, particularly sown grasses, and field turnips,
would be of the greatest advantage.  This advantage the
people cannot enjoy without inclosures; and inclosures will
not become general, till the proprietors encourage that spe-
cies of improverment more than they do at present.  A tacks-
man or tenant has little inducement to make improvements.
His lease is short, never exceeding 19 years.  The expence of
stocking his farm, may in general, be supposed, for a few
years, to exhaust his money; and in a country which was for-
merly possessed by small and poor tenants, and which has
been but lately stocked with sheep, the tacksmen are only
beginning to have comfortable dwelling-houses; and there
are many small inclosures of different kinds still wanting for
the sheep; so that a great part of a man's lease will be ex-
pired, before he can get himself conveniently set down;
and should be continue to make other improvements, parti-
