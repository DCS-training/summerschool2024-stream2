as Lamblash, would be of inestimable value to the Duke of
Hamilton, the proprietor, and would tend greatly to the im-
provement of the whole island.

Harbours and Lighthouse. - There are only 2 harbours in
the island, viz. Lamblash and Lochranza. Lamblash Bay is
a semicircle. Holy Isle, in the mouth of it, forms the har-
bour, having an inlet or opening at both points. A light-
house is lately erected on the isle of Pladda, which directs
ships into the port of Lamblash at night. The fourth end of
Arran is rocky; and many shipwrecks happened there before
the light-house was erected. Lochranza, at the north end of
Arran, affords a safe harbour for small boats, in the time of
the herring fishing. An old castle, situated at the bottom of
the bay, serves to direct the boats into the harbour.

Population. - The number of souls, at present (1793) in
the parish, is                                     2545
The return to Dr. Webster, in 1755, was            1369

This increase would have been considerably greater, had not
the population diminished of late; as upwards of 300 sailors
go annually to the royal navy, the bounty fishing, or on board
merchant ships, many of whom never return.

Ecclesiastical State and Poor. - The Duke of Hamilton is
patron. There are 2 ministers in the island, each of whom
has a yearly stipend of 70l., with a glebe and a manse. An
assistant to both is settled at Lochranza, and has the charge of
the northern district, with an annual salary of 500 merks Scotch.
- There are only 12 on the poor's roll. Quarterly collections
