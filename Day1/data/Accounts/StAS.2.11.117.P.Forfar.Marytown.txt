<TABLE=Population>          III.--POPULATION.

	By Dr Webster's report in 1755, the population was	633
        By last Stathstical Account in 1793,	                529
        By the census in 1801,	                                596
                      in 1821,                                  451
                      in 1831,                                  419

   A decrease of 177 thus appears to have taken place in the last
thirty years. It may be remarked, however, that, when the census
was taken last year, there were twenty men employed at an em-
bankment of the river South Esk, who will remain in this parish
no longer than while employed at that work; so that the real popu-
lation of the parish at present is not more than 400, being a de-
crease of 200, or one-third of the whole population, since the be-
ginning of the present century. The cause of that decrease is evi-
dently the enlargement of the farms, and the consequent removal
of the cottagers. Thirty years ago, the number of farmers resid-
ing in the parish was fourteen. At present the whole land is occu-
pied by seven, of whom only four reside in the parish.

   Character and Habits of the People.--The ordinary food of the
peasantry is oatmeal and milk. They enjoy in a reasonable de-
gree the comforts and advantages of society, and appear to be con-
tented with their situation and circumstances. Their general cha-
racter may be termed moral and religious. They are regular in
their attendance on public worship; and they show a desire to read
religious books given out from the parish library.
