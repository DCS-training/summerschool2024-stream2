graindeur and awful solemnity of such a scene. Snow-storms also
occassionally happen; but coming as they do from the north-east
and east, and having, consequently, to cross a great extent of
mountains before they reach this island, they are, in great mea-
sure, spent before they arrive. Sometimes, however, the ground is
covered with snow to a considerable depth; but through in the deep
receases and ravines of the granite mountains it lies deep, and long;
yet it seldom lies longer than a few days in the low grounds, and
on the sea-shore it is speedily dissolved.
	The following meteorological Table has been oblibingly furnish-
ed by Robert Stevenson, Esq. Civil-Engineer. It is taken from
the journal kept at Pladda Light-house, situate in the county of
Bute, in 55&deg; 30 north latitude, and 5&deg; 4 west longitude, elevated
130 feet above the medium level of the sea, containing monthly and
annual averages of the observations made daily for the year 1836.

	The streams, or tivulets, owing to the mountainous character of
the island, are numerous; many of them of considerable size and
rapidity and all affording good sport to the angler. Some of them
in their course, form cascades of great height and beauty. Those
most deserving of notice are the cascades of Europe, on Auchin-
law waters, and Eaucuphan on Laven water. The farmers occa-
sionally prevents a phenomenon of singular and beatiful appear-
ance, an iris, perfectly circular in form.
	There are many fresh-water lakes interspersed through the hills
of the interior. Those of most note are Lech hose about a mile
in lenght, but very narrow, and Loch Tanna, about two miles in
