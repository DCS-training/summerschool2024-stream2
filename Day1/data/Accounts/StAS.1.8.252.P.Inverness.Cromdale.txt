   Extent, Soil and Surface.-The extent of it is very consider-
able, being fully 13 Scotch miles in length, and generally 3
or 4 miles broad, in the old inhabited country; but on ac-
count of the late improvements, which are very numerous, the
breadth, in some parts, is no less than from 6 to 7 miles.  The
soil is generally dry and thin, with the exception of some
flats or low haughs, close by the river Spey, which, in point
of natural fertility, are equal to those near the sea side, which
is 20 miles distant from every part of this parish.  An hun-

useless, now rendered productive of the greatest source of na-
tional wealth, by the stocks of sheep, which every where co-

number they were a few years ago, as well as proportionally
increased in point of value.  The plantations of fir, which are
numerous, and are thriving fast, will soon have a good effect
in setting off the country to very great advantage.

   Situation, Climate and Diseases.-The parish lies within the
counties of Inverness and Moray, in almost an equal propor-

shire of Moray, and some of those lands, nearest to Forres arid
Elgin, belonging to the county of Inverness.  This seeming
confusion must have originated from the interest the differ-
