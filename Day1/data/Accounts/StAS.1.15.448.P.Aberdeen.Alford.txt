     Statistical Account

from that circumstance, auld fuirde came to be the name of
the church and parish; both these derivations seem to be of
modern date, and entirely dependent upon the present man-
ner of spelling; for the names of almost all other places in
this county are of Gaelic original; and the name of the pa-
rish, in records two hundred years old, is written Awfurde,
an orthography which corresponds with the present pronoun-
ciation.
   The county of Alford is situated from 20 to 31 miles
West from Aberdeen; and besides the parish of that name,
which is the largest, and the subject of this account, com-
prehends four other parishes, Forbes, Keig, Gillynessle, and
Tough.  It is surrounded on every side by hills and moun-
tains, and there is no entrance to it, but by ascending con-
siderable heights to gain the hollow passes between them.
On the South, it is bounded by Coueny^; on the East by
Menoway or Cainwilliam; on the North East, and North, by
Bennachee*, and the hills of Careen; and on the West by
Caliever.  These boundaries contain a country which, reckon-
ing from the brows of the opposite mountains, is about 11
miles in length, and from 4 to 6 in breadth.  A considerable
portion of this space is a level country, especially in the low-
er parts; but the flatness is every where varied by gentle
swells, and eminences, which in the upper parts rise to great-
er height.  The climate of this country can neither be said
to be very wet or very dry.  Its distance from the ocean oc-
casions more intense frosts, and longer lying snows; but, on
the, other hand, that, and the surrounding mountains, protect
and cover this country from the North East fogs and winds,
which are so unfavourable to vegetation in less sheltered situ-
ations, and places which are upon the coast.  Besides several
