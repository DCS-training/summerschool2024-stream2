     NUMBER XXVIII.

     PARISH OF CUMMERTREES.

     (County of Dumfries.-Presbytery of Annan.-Synod of
     Dumfries.)

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   FROM the name of the parish there is little doubt of its
having been formerly covered with timber.  Consider-
able tracts of natural wood still remain, besides the subter-
renean forests of oak, fir, and birch, with which the mosses
are every where replenished.  It now consists of the antient
parish of Cummertrees, and of the parish or chaplainry of
Trailtrow annexed to it after the Reformation; and the
whole is bounded by the Solway Frith on the south, by the
parishes of Annan and St. Mungo on the east, and Dalton
and Ruthwell on the north and west.  The parish is about 4
miles long and 3 miles broad; but, as its figure is very irre-
gular, its extent cannot be accurately determined.

   Climate and Soil.-The climate is like that of most of the
other parishes on the Solway Frith, humid, but by no means
unhealthy; and the division that has lately taken place of
large tracts of common, and the consequent improvement of
those lands, by inclosing and draining, do no doubt contri-
bute to the salubrity of the air, and the prevention of diseases
