quite unknown here, and the resort on our roads is too lit-
tle for the expense of them.  Dr Ramsay, above men.
tioned, built a bridge of five arches over the Feugh at
Whitestone.  It accommodates the public very well, be-
ing on the great south and north road.  There is no bridge
over the Chattie.  One over it is greatly wanted, below
Marywell, and also below Inverchatt.  There is a bridge
over the Burn of Birse, nigh the church.  But in no place
is a bridge so much wanted, nor could one be built that
would accommodate this parish, and the public in general,
so much as at Pot-arch, over the Dee, near Inchbair.  The
great south and north road passes the Dee there.  This
road is greatly frequented, and is used by the military, be-
ing much nearer from Edinburgh to Fort George, than a.
long the coast.  During this very season (1792), the mili-
tary had occasion to use this road repeatedly; once going
north, to quell the riots in Ross-shire; a second time, in
going from Fort George, on account of the disturbances in
Dundee.  The Dee is a rapid river, always inconvenient,
often dangerous and impassable.  Had the latter been the
case on the above emergencies, what might the conse-
quences have been?  Besides, there is no other place on all
this rapid river, where a bridge could he erected at so little
expense, and at the fame time be of such public utility.
Nature has pointed out the spot where it ought to be.  At
Pot-arch, less than L. 1500 would do more to accommo-
date the public, than L. 5000 would do almost any where
else over a river of the same magnitude.  It is said that
Dr Ramsay meant also to build a bridge over the Dee, at
Pot-arch, had he not been deterred from the undertaking,
by the extravagant estimate of an unskillful architect.  A
plan of this bridge, which is so much wanted, is in the
House of Finzean; and had the late Haughton been spared
for some years, it is laid some means would have been de-
