dunged by folding, (or as it is here called, toathed,) are crop-
ped with oats, upon the same plan as those that are, with the
difference of being one or two years less in tillage, and one
or two more lee.  Under this division of the lands on a farm
in this county, faughs or faughlands, (a corrupt pronouncia-
tion of sallow) are included.  They are ploughed once in
summer, and left in that state till spring, when they are sown
with very inferior oats, of which they bear three or four suc-
cessive crops; and are then left to the operations of nature
for several years, to recruit them for another period of tillage.
The soil of out-field land, in general, is inferior to that of in-
field, only by the difference in cultivation, and being more
stony.  The bad usage of the untoathed out-fields and faughs,
will easily account for their want of fertility, in raising grain
crops; but more especially in producing grass, the badness
and poorness of which it is not easy to describe.  The oats
sown upon out-field lands, are in quality according to the
goodness of the soil, and the state in which it is.  In the best
dunged folds, the white oats, and in the inferior lands, and
on faughs, grey oats, called here hairy and barley corn, are
generally sown.  As, after folding, the land is only once
ploughed, and frequently with a deep fur, the dung is
buried the first year, and works its effects on the second and
third crops; and, therefore, the first three crops are nearly
alike, and will rarely run beyond four bolls per acre, on an
average; and for the two last years, they dwindle down to
betwixt two and three, and often less.  The produce of the
untoathed out-fields, is much inferior in quantity, as well as
quality; and indeed the return from faughs in grain, will
seldom defray the expences of labour and seed; and the far-
mers are tempted to plough them, though it is to their own
loss, merely for the sake of the small quantity of straw which
