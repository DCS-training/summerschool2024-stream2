racter of the present race is sobriety, industry, and œconomy.
The lower class are humane, civil, obliging, and hospitable.
The rich are more:  They are genteel, and well bred.  But
the best proof of their morals is, that most of them are in
comfortable, and many of them in affluent circumstances, ac-

distilleries has brought almost entirely into disuse.

through, till it leaves it on the north-east quarter.
   On the other side of the river, opposite to the place where
the road enters the parish, stood the ancient town of Bertha,
