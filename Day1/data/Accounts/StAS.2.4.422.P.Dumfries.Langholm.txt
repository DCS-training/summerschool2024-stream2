     	    Under plantations of various kinds,				 420
 	    Not in tillage, but affording excellent pasture,	       12006

	Rent of Land.--In this large parish, where there is so much low
and high ground, the rent per acre must vary accordingly. The
land in the immediate neighbourhood of the town lets so high as
L. 2, 10s. and L. 1, 5s. per acre. No sheep-farmer is much in-
clined to inform strangers either of the extent of their farms, the
numbers of their flocks, or the rent they pay. The grazing of a
milk cow for the season costs L. 1, 10s., and the half of that for a
calf or stirk. A full-grown sheep, 5s.
	Rate of Wages.-- The rate of labour for country artisans is as
follows: In summer, joiner, without victuals, per day, 1s. 9d. to
2s. ; masons, ditto, 2s. to 2s. 6d. ; tailors, with victuals, as it is
common for them to go to the houses of their employers, 1s. 6d.;
day-labourers, viz. dikers, ditchers, &c. 1s. 6d.; ploughmen, with
board for the half year, and other full-grown male farm-servants,
from L. 7 to L. 8; female servants for agricultural purposes, with
board, in 3, 3s. to L. 4. In harvest, for the space of five, weeks,
