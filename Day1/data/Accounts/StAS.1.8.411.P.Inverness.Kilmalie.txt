July, are the principal months for salmon;-July, August,
and September, for white trouts and finnacks,-November,
for char,-and April, for yellow trouts.  Any salmon, that are
sold in the parish, fetch 3 d., and sometimes 4 d. per lib., and
white trouts 2 d.  The fishing, upon the property of Mr.
M'Lean of Ardgour, is worth 20 L. annually.  But the prin-
cipal fishing is upon the Lochy, the property of the Duke of
Gordon, and of Mr. Cameron of Locheile.  The following ta-
ble will show the number of fish caught upon it, during the
last 7 years, their prices at Fort-William, and the markets to
which they were exported.

grilse, or thereabouts.  The price of each cask, including salt,
cooperage, etc. costs 13 s.  The rent of the river, and ex-
pences attending the fishing, are about 370 L. a-year.  The
average of those 7 years, is 2195 3/7 salmon, and 1513 grilse,

3 L. 16 s. 8 d., are worth only 352 L. 13 s. 4 d.; whereas the
rent and expences, as stated, are 370 L. per annum.  It is,
