is frost on the mainland, there is often mild weather in these
islands; when snow in the one, there is often but rain in the
other.  The rain water lodges on this flat surface; and with
the exhalations from so many lakes, in calm weather, often
rises in mist  An inland country, in this damp situation,
would be very unhealthy; but the healthy sea air generally
drives away whatever is noxious.  The houses of the com-
mon people are generally in dry situations and remarkably
warm, built as usual in sandy islands (partly through want
of stones, which are ill to quarry, but mostly out of choice,)
of an inner and outer single wall, filled up in the middle with
sandy earth from 4 to 6 feet thick.  The people are lively,
industrious, and chearful, and often engaged in active em-
ployments, in the open air; yet the dampness of the place,
the want of proper firing, and the poor living of many, seem
to be the great causes of frequent rheumatisms, dysentaries,
and nervous fevers.  Draining of the lakes, and flat grounds,
may add much to the salubrity of the place.  Both isles, up-
on the whole, appear to be healthy from the great age to
which many of the inhabitants attain.
