   When there is to be rain,
                       "e pastu decedends agmine magno
		Corvorum increpuit densis exercutis alis,"
and various sea birds may be seen,
		"Certain largos humeris infurdere rores."
   Climate.--The climate of the parish is variable. The inha-
bitants, however, enjoy much health, and live to a good old age.
Rhematic distempers prevail, occasioned, probably, by the change-
fulness of the climate.
   The accompanying table will show the commencement of seed-
time and harvest in the highland district of the parish, for a series of
years. It is extracted from the journal of an intelligent farmer.

   Hydrography--There are several chalbeate springs in the pa-
rish, some also slightly sulphuretted. I am not aware that any of
these have been analyzed.
   There are no less than twelve fresh water lochs in the parish.
The lochs of Castle-Kennedy and Soulseat are remarkable for their
beauty, and are well worthy of a visit from the lover of lake scenery.
The loch of Soulseat was called in former times the Green Lake,
and an outlet is still called the Green Ford. At certain seasons
the loch is overspread with a green seed-like substance, but

   There are no rivers of any magnitude in the parish. The Luce,
a stream which rises in Carrick, and flowing with much rapidity
over a rocky bed, discharges itself into the Bay of Luce, is the
boundary line between this parish and New Luce. The Pilanton,
