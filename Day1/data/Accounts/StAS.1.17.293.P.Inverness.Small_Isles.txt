ty rock, called Corrandhun, on the top of which a small rui-
nous building remains.  Not many yards distant from this is
a rock of the plumb pudding kind, which is sometimes sur-
rounded by the sea.  The side of it next the rock is nearly
perpendicular.  In this side of the rock, considerably above
the level of the sea, there is, in a horizontal position, the
remains of a tree, nearly in a putrid state, apparently form-
ing a part of the solid rock, and having at least 5 or 6 fa-
thoms of the rock above it.  There is no room to doubt
that it has been wood, and its fibres have a near resemblance
to those of oak.  Its situation makes it one of the greatest
curiosities discovered in any country.

formerly worn by married women, and the tonnac, or short
plaid worn by females in general, are now almost wholly
out of use.  Instead of these, caps of various fashions, short
and long cloaks great coats, and ribbands, have been substi-
tuted.  The men, such of them especially as follow the fish-
ing, find the change in their dress highly convenient, and it
may be presumed that they borrowed it from the seafaring
people, who frequented these isles.  Some people think that
it was introduced by the Highlanders, who served in the last
American war.  The change in the dress of the women
may be thus accounted for: Most of our young women go
to the low country for some weeks in harvest; this time
they spend in shearing; and with the money thus earned,
