as large, near Craigdow.  These lochs either do not abound
in fish, or the fishings are totally neglected.  From them, and
from numberless springs which rise out of every hill, flow
many small streams, which wander through the parish, and
afford abundance of pure water.  Except the very tops of
Mochrum and Craigdow, and a few spots of moss, the whole
parish is arable.
   There is little or no natural wood in the parish.  But the
wants of this is happily supplied by the plantations made by
the Earl of Cassillis and Sir Adam Fergusson.  The former
has, within these few years, planted upon his estate, and espe-
cially in his policy, 560 acres; and, notwithstanding their
proximity to the Sea, the trees are exceedingly thriving.
Sir Adam Fergusson, on that part of his estate in this parish
which lies on the north side of the water of Girvan, and op-
posite to his seat of Kilkerran, has planted 240 acres, all of
which are in the most thriving condition.  The soil of the
parish is different.  The difference in the kind of soil is mark-
ed nearly by the great post road from Ayr to Girvan, which
passess through the whole length of the parish from N. to S.
Between this road and the sea-shore, comprehending about
4000 acres of land, the soil is generally a very rich loam,
mixed with a considerable quantity of clay.  There are few
or no banks of sand, and the land is dry, and favourable for
pasture or the plough, even to the sea-mark.  To the south
and east of the above post road, the ground rises consider-
ably; the soil is more light, upon a free-stone bottom, inter-
mixed also with some clay; and is upon the whole more
wet than the land towards the shore.

   State of Agriculture.-Notwithstanding the advantages of
soil, and other circumstances, this parish was, forty years ago,
generally in a wild and uncultivated state.  Indeed, there
