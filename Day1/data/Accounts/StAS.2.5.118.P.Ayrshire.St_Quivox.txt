                   THE REV. STAIR M'QUHAE, MINISTER.


         I.-TOPOGRAPHICAL AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name.-The name of the parish is now generally written St
Quivox, but sometimes St Evox. At an earlier period it appears
always to have been written St Kevoch. The name is supposed to
be derived from "Sancta Kennocha Virgo in Coila," who lived in
the reign of Malcolm II, and was distinguished for her zeal in
promoting monastic institutions.
	Extent, &c.--The parish is about 5 miles in leght, and 3 in
breadth, and contains about 5000 acres. It is bounded on the
south by the river Ayr, and on the east, north, and west, by
the parishes of Tarbolton, Monkton, and Newton.
  Topographical appearance.-In general the surface of the pa-
rish is level but towards the eastern extremity it becomes more
elevated and uneven. The temperature is mild, the snow scarcely
ever lying more than two days. Westerly winds prevail, which
are with a southerly wind, and with east wind the barometer al-
most uniformly rise. The soil nearest the sea is generally light
and sandy, with moss and clay dikes in particular parts. These
springs; and the small portion of higher land in the parish is a
stiff clay soil.
	Geology and Mineralogy.--The geological and mineral cha-
racter of the parish is of the order of stratified rocks belonging to
the coal formation. The workable seams of coal intermediate
with the other strata are only two,-the uppermost, a seam of
about four feet in thickness, being tender and frangible, whilst
the second seam, of nearly the same thickness, is very hard, and
not easily broken, being of the quality termed splint-coal, The
two seams are more than twenty fathoms from each other, These
seams of coal are the same which have been extensively worked
