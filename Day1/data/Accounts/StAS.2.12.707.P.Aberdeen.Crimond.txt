                      II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Eminent Characters.-Among many eminent men born in, or
connected by ancestry with, the parish, are Arthur Johnstone, the
famous Latin poet of the sixteenth century, (the rival of Buchan-
an), and John Farquhar, born at Bilbo, and afterwards well known
both in England and Scotland as the "rich Farquhar of Fonthill."
By a long course of preserving industry, and almost miserly eco-
nomy, he amassed an immense fortune in India, it is believed, as
an extensive manufacturer of gunpowder for the government ser-
vice, as well as a successful commercial speculator.  At one pe-
riod, there is reason to suppose, he had intended to leave the bulk
of it for the advancement of education in Scotland, but his will
not being forthcoming, his relatives succeeded to the whole.
   Land-owners.-The chief land-owners, ---- Forbes, Esq. of
Crimond; Adam Cumine, Esq. of Rattray; Charles Bannerman,
