     General Appendix to

   Aspect and Figure.-The aspect is to the S. W.; the fi-
gure, that of an irregular amphitheatre, of which the straight
part is along the river Annan.  The level part extends from
thence about a mile, to the N E.; and behind it, the travel-
ler takes notice of two ridges of green hills: the nearer of
which is mostly arable; and the farther, much higher than
the other, intermingled with short heath, and affording ad-
mirable pasture for sheep.  From the heights, the water of
Wamphray falls down, through deep linns, into the level
ground; crossing the great road from Glasgow to Carlisle, in
a gravel bed, and falling into the Annan.  In this gravel, it
sometimes disappears; at other times, it does considerable
damage, and even raises terror, coming down in floods.-
From three miles to one mile above the mouth, Wamphray
water presents a beautiful scenery.  Here, it has shaped out
stupenduously deep linns; the sides of which are so closely
covered with woods, that it is not seen, except here and
there, in its rocky course, at the bottom.  The fall of the
water has worn the rocks into a number of cascades.  On
the north brow of the linn are ruins of buildings, where the
family of Wamphray once resided; and on the opposite brow
appears the manse: the buildings, the tall woods, the deep
linns and water falls forming a scene singularly romantic.
Clumps of trees are seen in different places throughout the
parish; and to the westward, the eye marks the happy ef-
fects of improvement, in a large plantation of fir trees; and
also in the parish of Johnston, on a large tract of land,
which was lately a barren moor, but is now covered with rich
crops.  On the same side are seen the venerable ruins of the
tower of Lochwood, the old family seat of the lords of An-
nandale, appearing over the aged trees that surround it.
