     Statistical Account

quors, this patriotic resolution was either forgotten or abandon-
ed.-As to dress, about 50 years ago, there were few females
who wore scarlet or silks.  But now, nothing is more com-
mon, than silk caps and silk cloaks; and women, in a mid-
dling station, are as fine as ladies of quality were formerly.
The like change may be observed in the dress of the male sex,
though, perhaps, not in the same degree.

   School and Language.-There is a public established
school in this parish, with a salary of L. 10 yearly; and there
are two private schools in the town, besides some in the country.
The Scots dialect is the language spoken, but is gradually im-
proving, and approaching nearer to the English.

   Climate, Etc.-The air is milder and more temperate here,
than towards the eastern coast of Scotland.  It is rather wet,
but not unhealthy.
   There are no diseases peculiar to this parish.  Inoculation
for the small pox is practised with success.  As a means of bet-
ter health, it were to be wished, that the clothing, and houses
of the lower, sort, were more warm and comfortable.  The
contributing thereto would reflect great honour, and afford
much real satisfaction to the more opulent.-The inhabi-
tants of this parish, are in general, addicted to exercise and
temperance, two great sources of long life and good health.
But death, against who there is no defence, is ever snatch-
ing away some of all ranks and ages, the rich and the poor,
the young and the healthy, as well as the old and the diseased.
The people, however, in general, are long-lived.  Among
other instances of longevity, the ministers might be adduced.
The late incumbent, Mr Maitland, held the charge of Machlin
for 44 years; and the present incumbent was ordained about
50 years ago, to wit, in April 1742.
