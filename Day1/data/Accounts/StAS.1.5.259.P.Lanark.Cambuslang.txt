2 for slabbing.  Each of the jennies spins 84 threads at once.
The carding machines are driven by water, which is col-
lected from many different springs, into a reservoir at the
foot of Dichmount hill, and conveyed from thence to the
cotton work, about 1/4 of a mile distant, partly by an open
runner, and partly by wooden pipes.  An ordinary cotton
spinner can gain about 10 s. a week.  This work gives em-
ployment to 50 people old and young, and occasions a circu-
lation of about L. 700 a-year.

   Roads and Bridges.-Roads have of late become objects
of great consequence, and much labour and expence are
now bestowed upon them.  The most public road is that
from Hamilton to Glasgow, which passes through the pa-
rish from east to west.  This road was originally made by
the statute work; but was some years ago improved, and
has since been kept in repair, by a toll levied at a turnpike
near Glasgow.  There are two other roads, much fre-
quented by coal, lime, and ironstone carts, which cross the
parish from south to north.  Both of these were made, and
are still supported by the statute work, which is converted
into money, at the rate of 15 s. for each plough, and 2 s
for each householder.  The only bridges within the parish
are on rivulets, but there are two bridges on Calder water.
One of these, probably the oldest in this district, is called
Prior bridge, either because it was built at the expence, or
for the convenience, of the priory in Blantyre.

   Church, etc.-The minister's living consists of 118 bolls
12 pecks of oat-meal, L. 30 of money, 100 merks for
communion elements, a manse, and about 4 1/2 acres of
glebe; which, in whole, valuing the oat-meal of 11 1/2 d. the
peck, is worth L. 140 per annum.  The kirk, which is a
neat plain edifice, was built in 1743, and the manse in 1756;
