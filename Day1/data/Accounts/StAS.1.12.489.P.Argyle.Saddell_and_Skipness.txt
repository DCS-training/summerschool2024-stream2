Highlands and Islands of Scotland.  But it is to be hoped;
that in the reign of the best of Kings, and during an admini-

the present clergy comfortable, but that provisions will be
made by Goverment for the support of such an additional
number, as are neccessary for reducing such parisher as are at
present too large and extensive within reasonbale bounds.
This would render the duties both of ministers and people,
not only easy and pleasant to themselves, but profitable to the 
nation, by facilitating the means of adding to the stock of
publick virtue, and publick prosperity; for, it is the surest
way of attaining to that righteousness which exalteth a na-
tion.
