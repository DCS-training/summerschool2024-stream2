that of Ratho; almost from every part of it, the capital, with
its extensive environs and surrounding hills, are in full view.
From the small eminences in the west end of the parish, these
views appear to the greatest advantage.  One of these de-
mands particular attention.  From the top of the south Platt
Hill, immediately above the manse *, can be pointed out 14
different counties full in view.  Some assert, that parts of 16
counties, making one half of Scotland, may be seen from that
spot.  This prospect gives a full view of the Forth, from the
island of May towards Stirling; the coasts of Fife, Kinross,
and Clackmannan; the hills in the shires of Perth, Stirling,
and Dunbarton, as far as Ben. Lomond; the three Lothians,
Berwickshire, &c.-The great road from Edinburgh to Glas-
gow runs nearly through the middle of the parish, and a-
longst it from Addiston Bridge to Bonington, for more than
two miles, there is one uninterrupted scene of the most beau-
tiful and valuable plantation any where to be seen.  It com-
prehends the extensive pleasure grounds of Addiston, Ratho,
Dalmahoy, Hatton, and Bonington.

   Church and School.-The church is situated exactly 7 miles
west from Edinburgh.  It is very old; but when it was found-
ed is uncertain.  The stipend consists of 5 chalders of victual,
58 L. 8 s. 6 d. Sterling in money, which, at the county con-
version of 10 s. 5 d. per boll, makes the stipend equal to 100 L.
Sterling.  But, from the usual difference between the county
conversion and the selling prices, it is equal to 120 L. commu-

*There are the remains of two encampments, both probably
Danish; the one on K times Hill, in the south, west corner of
the parish, the other on the South Platt Hill, immediately above
the manse; but the hit, within these few years, has been, in a
great measure, destroyed, by blowing and carrying off the
stones for building dikes and other purposes.
