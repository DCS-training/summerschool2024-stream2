Limestone is also wrought in some parts of the parish, parti-
cularly on the north side of the parish, and at the west end, but
not to any very great extent, as the Cumbernauld lime is of excel.
lent quality, and generally used in this parish. Where the lands
in the parish lie in the vicinity of the canal, or railway, or good
roads, the minerals are considered of equal value, sometimes of
more value than the surface. On the south side of the parish the
metals in general dip to the south or south-west, towards the Clyde;
but on the north side of the parish they in general dip to the east
and south-east.
