ers sent from Scotland to treat with the English Parliament about
the union of the kingdoms: and a laird of Durie of the same
family sat in the first Scottish Parliament of Charles II. in 1660.
  Mr Jerome Stone, a man remarkable for talent and erudition,
was born in this parish, and of humble parents, about the year 1727.
He commenced his career in life as a travelling chapman, and
afterwards became an itinerant bookseller. Possessing a peculiar
talent for acquiring languages, be became, by his own unaided exer-
tions, one of the most eminent linguists of his time; but died in early
life at the age of thirty, while schoolmaster of the parish of Dun-,
keld. At his death he was preparing for the press an "Inquiry
into the original of the nation and language of the ancient Scots,
with conjectures about the primitive state of the Celtic and other
European Nations;" and he left in manuscript the well known
allegory, entitled, "The Immortality of Authors," which has
been often reprinted, and is a lasting monument of his lively fancy,
sound judgment, and correct taste.

  Parochial Registers.--The oldest volume of records, which has
been well kept, contains the general act of the kirk-session from
1626 to 1642, and the particular acts from 1640 to 1655. The
records commence again in 1667, and are brought down to the
present time, with the exception of two blanks, one between the
years 1746 and 1764, and the other between 1781 and 1798. This
last blank has been accounted for by the sudden death of the ses-
sion-clerk, who had neglected to transcribe, the minutes of session
from the note-book into the regular record; and that now-book
is now lost.
  Antiquities.--There are but few vestiges of antiquity in the pa-
rish, though there is little doubt of its having been, in early times,
the scene of mortal strife, as is testified by the near neighbourhood
of the standing stones of Lundin. It is said in the former Statis-
