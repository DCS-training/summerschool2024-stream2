census, a small village has arisen, which took its origin in an at-
tempt to work the lime quarry already alluded to, but, at the high-
est calculation, this has not added more than 100 to the number
of the inhabitants.
	The following returns are copied from a census of the parish
taken by the present incumbent in the years 1824-5, since which
period the population has been nearly stationary. It shows a po-
pulation somewhat under that of the Government census; but as it
was taken with great care, and each family was separately enrolled,
the writer is inclined to rely on its correctness. A common source
of error in the returns to Government arises from the circumstance,
that the inhabitants frequently state to the schoolmaster the whole
number of children belonging to their respective families, whether
residing in the parish at the time or not,--a mistake which must
swell the amount, by causing many individuals to be counted more
than once. The difference in the present instance probably arises
from that source. The minister's census only includes the num-
ber actually residing in the parish at the time it was taken.
