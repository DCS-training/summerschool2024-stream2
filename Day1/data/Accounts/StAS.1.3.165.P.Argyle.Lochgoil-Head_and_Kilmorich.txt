people who live in the immediate neighbourhood.  In gene-
ral, it is found cheaper to bring lime-stone from Ireland;
but the quantity of lime use in this country is very incon-
siderable.  There is a lead mine near the head of Loch-fine,
but it has never been wrought.  Some years ago, a company,
who were concerned in lead-mines in other parts of Argyle-
shire, sent persons to open up and examine the place, in this
parish, where the lead was supposed to exist.  These persons
found, that there was a lead mine, and carried away some of
the ore; which, upon trial, was found to contain a greater
proportion of silver than any lead ore in the west of Scot-
land.  The company were upon terms with the proprietor
for a lease of the mines, but no bargain was concluded.

   Caves.-Among the rocks in this parish, there are a great
number of natural caves, vaults, and grottos, of different
forms and dimensions.  One of these caves is situated a little
below a very hige and tremendous rock, from which a
great number of smaller rocks seem to have been torn, either
by lightening, or by some convulsion of the earth; probably
by the former, as lightening produced a similar effect, a few
years ago, in another part of the country.  Among these
smaller rocks is the cave already mentioned.  The entry to
it is in the form of an arch, about 4 feet high, and 3 broad.
The cave itself is very spacious, of a circular figure, but not
perfectly regular.  It is mmore than 70 feet in circumference 
and about 10 feet in height.  All around the cave there are
smaller vaults, resembling cellars; and, from one part of it,
a narrow passage leads to a small apartment, not unlike a
keeping chamber.  The cave is covered above by a great
number of large rocks, which appear to have been thrown
upon one another withoyt any order or regularity; within, it
is perfectly dry, but rather dark, having no light but what
