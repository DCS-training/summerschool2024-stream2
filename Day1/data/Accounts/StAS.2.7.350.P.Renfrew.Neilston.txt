thing has undergone a change. The soil has been improved and
fertiliied, and the climate rendered milder and more genial, by
draining and drying the land, and by sheltering belts and clumps
of planting. In 17905 there were only two small cotton-mills, one
printfield, and two bleachfields. In 1837, there are six large cot-
ton-mills, eight printfields, and eight bleapbfields, besides a variety
of other works. In 1790, the population was 2330 souls, in 18,'36
it was 9187. In 1790, there were only one Episcopalian, one
Roman Catholic, and six Dissenters in the parish; in 1836 there
were, Episcopalians, 236; Roman Catholics, 1091; Dissenters,
1296 ; total, 2623. In 1790, there were 429 rittings for a popu-
lation of 2330 souls; in 1836, there were only 830 sittings for
a population of 9187. In 1790, there were only three schools in
the parish; now there are thirteen, besides five at mills, nd four
female schools for reading and sewing. In 1790, the school-
master's salary was only L. 8,'6s. Sd. ; now it is about L. 36,
with an excellent schoolhouse and small garden. In 1790, there
were no Justices of the Peace, save one; now there are nine, five
of whom are residents. In 1790, there was no Justice of Peace
Court; in 1837, there is one held the first Monday of every month,
alternately at Neilston and at Barrbead. In 1790, there were an-
nually killed from thirty to forty cows; in 1 836, there were slain 380.
In 1790, the killing of a lamb was a rare thing, and the flesher
went round amongst the better sort, as he called them, to inquire
who would take a leg of it; in 1836, there were slain in the parish
168 lambs, 7,78 sheep, 654 veals, and 20 swine. In 1790, the
roads were scarcely passable, but in the droughts of summer, and
hard frosts in winter; but now, owing to the conversion of the
statute labour, the country roads are excellent. In 1790, there
was only one public: road tbrouo,,h the parish to Dunlop, Stewartoin,
,Kilmarnock, and the whole of the west country. It was exceed-
ingly hilly and steep, in many places, and kept in bad condition.
In, 1837, there is a splendid turnpike road, which leads through
the whole length of the parish to 1-tvine and the western coast.
This road, which runs up the course of the Levern, and along the
beautiful banks of Loch-Libol is almost a dead level from Glas-
gow to Irvine. The making and alteration of this line of road from
the old, one, cost, it is said, the trustees about L. 18,000. There
are on it and the other turnpike roads in the parish, in all, twenty-
two a bridges, great and small.
Another great advantage would accrue to the inhabitants of Neil-
