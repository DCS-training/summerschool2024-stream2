     Statistical Account

   2.  It is certain, that tenements and streets in Perth are
described in charters, prior to the year 1210, the same as
they afterwards were; which would not have been the care,
if the old town had been destroyed.
   I crave the indulgence of producing one instance from two
charters which belonged to the Abbey of Scone, and which
are contained in the old chartulary, preserved in the Advo-
cates Library at Edinburgh.  They are not very long.  I
shall therefore give translations of them, only adding the
original words where the tenements and street are described.

"good men of his whole Realm, Clergy and Laity, Greet-
"ing.

"ed, to Henry Bald, that land in my Burgh of Perth, which
"James the son of Simon, and others, my Provost of Perth,
"have delivered to him according to my precept.

"which leads from the church of St John Baptist, to the cas-
"tle of Perth, on the east side, opposite to the house of An-
"drew, the son of Simon.  (Illam scilicet, qu‘ est in fronte
