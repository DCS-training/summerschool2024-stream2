    The enlarging of farms is the chief cause of the decrease of
population.  Very few have emigrated from Gigha to a foreign
country.  There is no town or village in the parish.

   There is one fatuous man in the parish, and a young man
from another parish who is boarded here.  There are none
who were born blind, but there are two who lost their eye-
sight, after they were considerably advanced in years.                          There
are two deaf and dumb children, a brother and sister, who are at
the Deaf and Dumb Institution, Edinburgh, one of them being
maintained there partly by the parents and other benevolent friends,
and the other by a society of ladies in Edinburgh.
    Gaelic is the language generally spoken ; English, however,
is much better understood by young and old than it was forty
years ago, but there are not above ten persons in the parish who
do not understand and speak Gaelic.
   The habits of the people are improving.  The limited accom-
modation in their houses is unfavourable to cleanliness, yet they
are gradually improving in this respect.
   The ordinary food of the inhabitants is potatoes and oatmeal,
potatoes and fish or milk, generally twice in the day, and often
three times. Fish being easily got, there is very little animal food
used by the greater part of the population.
   But though they often complain that they have not the food
and other comforts and conveniences which they conceive they
ought to have, such of them as leave the island generally embrace
the first opportunity of returning to it.  Here they can bring up
a family more easily than in most parts of the Highlands or Low-
  ARGYLE.                                   c c
