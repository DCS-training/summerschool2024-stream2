The bay of Peterhead affords a very safe anchorage for
ships of any burden, in all strong gales of wind from the
west, W. N. W. or W. S. W. and when they blow from
this quarter with any degree of violence, most ships going
either to the N. or S. are obliged to return hither for shel-

they can fetch no harbours on this coast, nor either the
frith of Cromarty or Forth, and their only place of refuge
is the bay and harbour of Peterhead.

   Present Extent.-I know of no accurate survey of this
parish, which ascertains precisely the number of acres in it;
I think they may estimated at 7000; 5000 of which
may be arable, and 2000 moss and moor, which mostly lie
in the S. and S. W. parts of the parish.

   Soil.-The soil is of great variety, from a sandy loam
and hazly thin soil, to a rich deep black earth, and a strong
clay soil; I am of opinion the greatest part of the arable
land, from the nature of the soil, is capable of as high cul-
ture, and, if properly managed, would produce as weighty
crops as the same extent of land in most parts of the
country.

parts of the country, at least in summer; in winter the
frosts are not near so intense as in other places; the air is
rather moist.  In summer there is a mist or fog proceeding
frequently from the sea, which sometimes extends no far-
ther than the town of Peterhead, and which is often pecu-
liar to this parish, but it is by no means unwholesome, and
