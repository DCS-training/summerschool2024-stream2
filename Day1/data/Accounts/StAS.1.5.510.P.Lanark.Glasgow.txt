or eight parishes of Glasgow, exluding the suburbs.  One of
these numerations was in the year 1785, when it was found, 
that there were 9285 houses in the city, from which deduct-
ing 183, being warehouses, or not inhabited, there remain
9102 inhabited houses.  The number of males was 16,363;
of females 19,776; total 36,139, which gives the number
in each house 3 97/100, and the proportion of males to fe-
males about 5 to 6.  The other numeration, which was
made in summer 1791, was under such a variety of checks,
that great confidence may be placed in it; the season of
the year did not allow the students to be taken in, and the
military were also excluded, as not being inhabitants.  The
result was 10,291 inhabited houses, and 41,777 inhabitants,
male and female, within the royalty and New Town,
which gives the number in each family about 4 1/18.  In
these years the number of baptisms and burials within the
city, exclusive of the suburbs, were,

   But a more just opinion of the population of Glasgow
will be found, by considering it as connected with its su-
burbs,from an enumeration of these also made in the year
1791, as follows:
