     Statistical Account

and as he is a gentleman of a liberal mind, and public spirit,
I have no doubt that he will carry on the work with success
and to a great extent.  This same seam has been wrought for
generations in different places of the west barony; but it
was given up for many years, till lately the work was re-
vived.
   The coal in the east barony, especially at Banton and Glen
Garrel, is of an inferior quality.  But for that reason, it is
useful for a variety of purposes which the other could not so
well serve.  It gives an uncommon heat, but upon being ex-
posed to the air, it moulders down into dross.  And when
thrown into a chimney, it is so brittle, that whenever it is
touched, it turns into a powder or mere gum.  But in an
oven, or furnace, or smith's forge, it is of great service: and
is one of the best coals for these purposes in the kingdom.  Of
course, there is a great demand for it from printfields,
and other public works, and from smiths, for 6, 10, or 12
miles round.
   None of those coals are far below the surface.  Of course,
they are easily kept level free.  In the west barony, the seam
is generally from 4 to 12, and in the east from 12 to 16 fathom
deep.  The strata in Glen Garrel, where coal has been
wrought for 50 years without interruption, lie generally in the
following order:
   1st, Soil and rubble.
   2d, A thin bed of blaes, or sometimes channel.
   3d, A post of free-stone, from 10 to 20 feet thick.
   4th, Indurated shivers, blaes, or sometimes in its place
a thin seam of coal 11 inches thick.
   In the east end of the parish, at a place called Bush,
is the richest and best seam of coal; but it is not level free,
and therefore would require a fire engine.  It has been
wrought to a considerable extent.  I find that Lord Kilsyth,
