carriages, 1s.  The canal boat runs twice a day; fares, 4d, steer-
age, 6d. cabin.  The steam trains, including stoppages, go in an
hour, the canal boats in two bours-the distance by both is about
ten miles.  The difference is 4d. per hour.  Some take the cheaper,
to save money, but the greater number the dearer, to save time.
The canal rates have been reduced since the introduction of rail-
ways nearly one-third, and yet the revenue is in a thriving condi-
tion.  In 1831, when the last population list was taken up, the
passengers, goods, &c. were as follows:

   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is situated near the
centre of the. parish, (which is much longer than broad,) rather to
the west side, where it is only 400 or 500 yards from the confines
of the parish of Bothwell.  It was built in 1790, by Mr Robert
Watson at the very moderate charge of L.500.  It is seated
for 894: add 8 seats to the corner of Rosehall galleries, 902
Eight pounds Scots entitles to one sitting. The whole seats
are in the possession of thirty-six individuals.  The estates
of Gartsherrie and Garturk, &c. bave 138 seats; Rosehall,
&c. 102; Carmyle, &C. 88; Drumpellier, Faskin, &c. 70;
Breadiesholm, 58; Daldowie, 42, &c.  There are two parishes,
quoad spiritualia, viz. Crosshill and Gartsherrie.  The new church
at Crosshill was the first in Scotland on the Church Extension
principle.  The church contains about 600, and has no galleries,
owing to the walls being too low.
   This parish is bounded on the south by the turnpike road from
Shotts to Glasgow; on the west, by the Barony parish of Glasgow;
on the north, by the parish of Cadder; and on the east, by the
Old Monkland parish road leading from Lusshill to Crosshill,
from Crosshill to nearly opposite Breadiesholm gate, thence by
the parish road, which leads past the west of Commonhead, thence
in a straight line to the Bishop Loch, a little to the east of Loch-
side farm-house, including all the houses and families within said
district, comprising a population of 2600.
   The church at Gartsherrie is a very elegant fabric.  It contains
1500 sittings.  It is 69 feet long and 49 feet wide, besides a large
lobby and stairs.  The height is 34 feet, the tower 136 feet, with
