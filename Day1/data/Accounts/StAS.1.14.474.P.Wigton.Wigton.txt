the memory of man.  The moss, from which the town
and neighbourhood of Wigton have been long supplied
with fuel, is from 5 to 10 feet deep; under which, and
lying on the clay surface, the trees are mostly now found.
The parts which are not covered with moss, are all of
them arable, and laboured as well as the rest of the pa-
rish.  The crops, however, are not equal to those on the

   Property.-Property is better divided in this parish than

the generality of the borough-acres, is let to tenants, who

now become much larger, than when the tenants were in
a condition of abject poverty, and the lands in an uncul-
tivated state.  The same extent which was farmed by 2,
or even by 4 tenants, is now generally held by 1.  And
there is a particular farm in the parish, now occupied by
2 men, which formerly contained 12 tenants.  There are
2 men here, who pay upwards of 200 L. Sterling of yearly
rent; 1 who pays about 150 L.; 3 who pay more than
