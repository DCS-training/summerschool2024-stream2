and exchanged his former tenants and dependants for a flock 
of fourth country sheep.  This step, altho' it had the appear-
ance of great rigour, has turned out much to the advantage
of the tenantry, who thereupon retired to the town of In-
verness; and applying themselves to industrious labour in
the two manufactories there, they thereby not only impro-
ved their living, but were enabled to give education and
trades to their children, some of whom are now sending
grateful remittances from distant climes.  The introduction
of sheep, though it at first had only the effect of banishing
the small tenantry, will, if successful, in a few years have the
same tendency towards the principal tacksmen; and this
once populous country will then exhibit the same scene of
depopulation as we behold in the borders of this part of the
united kingdoms: at same time, the success of this new plan
appears problematical, from the state of the climate, which
we shall now attempt to describe.-But we must here, in
treating of this parish, make a distinction betwixt the parts
of it to the east of Suichuiman, and those to the westward; 
the latter shall be denominated Abertarf, and the former 
Statherrick.

   Climate-The country of Abertarf, containing an exten-
sive plain from the west end of Lochness to the bounds of
the parish of Kilmanivaig, is hardly 30 to 40 feet above the
level of the sea; and owing to this circumstance, as well at
to the temperature of the lake, it is very little addicted to
any lasting snow; but from its contiguity to the Western
Ocean, much more liable to floods of rain than the eastern
part of the parish.-Stratherrick, rising gradually from the
river Tarf to an altitude of 400 or 500 feet above the level
of the lake, with the exception only of the principal resi-
dence of the family of Foyers, and some other possessions
on the banks of the lake, being nearly the central point be-
