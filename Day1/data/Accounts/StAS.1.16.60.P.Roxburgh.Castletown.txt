     NUMBER III.

     PARISH OF CASTLETOWN,

     (COUNTY OF ROXBURGH, PRESBYTERY OF LANGHOLM
     SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.)

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES ARKLE, Minister.

     Origin of the Names.

   THE origin of the modern, as well as of the ancient
name of this parish, is abundantly plain.  Upon the
summit of a precipice, about 100 feet perpendicular, on
the east bank of the river Liddal, and immediately above
the church, there was a strong fort or castle, the rampart
and fosseè of which remain entire: near to these, in the
place where the present road was formed, and in several
other parts in the immediate neighbourhood, many hearth-
stones were dug up, where a town or village had formerly
stood.  Hence the name of Castle-town.  But the ancient
name of this district, and indeed that by which it is still
most frequently denominated, was Liddisdale, from the
river Liddal, which runs through it in a direction from east
to south.  In the ancient histories, and geographical ac-
counts of Scotland, it is called the county of Liddisdale, and
in old writs it is designed the Lordship of that name.
