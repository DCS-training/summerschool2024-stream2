the town, and the accommodation of the inhabitants.  Be-
sides four fairs every year, there thas been a yearly tryst
held the beginning of October, since the year 1781, at
which there has been always a great shew of black cattle.
The present number of inhabitants is 594, and the popula-

small village, containing 64 inhabitants.  Here there is a
distillery, consisting of two 40  gallon-stills.
