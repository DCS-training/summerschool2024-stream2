     There was an unusual mortality in 1837, owing to the great
prevalence of typhus fever, measles, and what are usually named
hives. Influenza, also, was very prevalent and fatal at the com-
mencement of that year, chiefly among the aged and infirm; and
it was remarked, that although many persons died of other dis-
eases at that period, almost all these diseases assumed more or
less the type of this epidemic, as an accompaniment. The num-
ber of deaths was nearly as great as that arisitig from cholera and
other diseases in 1832; the former being 493, and the latter 600,
of which last number there were 180 deaths by cholera alone.
This alarming disease prevailed in the parish from 3d September
to Ist November 1832, and partially in the March preceding.
There were nearly 600 cases, although only 180 deaths.
     Marriages.-As the accuracy of the Register of Proclamation
of Marriages can be depended on, it may be interesting and use-
ful to know the average number of them at four different periods,
compared with the population and other circumstances. Accord-

     In 18Ol, the year of the great dearth, the number of marriages
was 62, which was the same as in the year immediately preceding,
while it rose in 1802 to 81, and in 1803 to 101. In the three
following years it fell, being 77, 87, and 93 respectively. In 1827,
after a great depression in trade, the number of marriages was only
106, while in the year immediately preceding and following, it was
125, and in 1830 it rose to 171. The Maltliusians will consider
these facts, as corroborative of their theory of population.
    The number of persons in the whole parishs including North
Queensferry, as nearly as can be gathered from the census of 1841,
is for the following age-
