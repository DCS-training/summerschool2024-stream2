     Statistical Account

Besides, as the market price of every commodity is regu-
lated by the proportion between those who buy and those
who sell, when his improvements are finished, a gentle-
man, who has his whole estate in the market at once, cannot
expect the same rent for it, as if he let every other year a
newly improved farm to a practical farmer.  Perhaps the
most advantageous way in which an estate can be impro-
ved, is to give the farmer encouragement, and even assist-
ance to improve it.  For example, if the necessary quan-
tity of lime cannot be afforded by the farmer, the proprie-
tor may give as much lime as is wanted, and ask for his
payment a gradual increase of rent.  The writer of this
article knew a gentleman who raised his rents from 15 s. to
L. 2 an acre in this manner.  He gave his farmers 50 bolls
of lime to each acre.  This cost him at that time about
L. 5, 5 s.  In three years the additional rise of rent indem-
nified him; and yet his farmers paid their rents regularly;
and one of them received L. 11 from his landlord, or the
rent of 5 1/2 acres, for two acres of sown grass.  The only
difficulty here is to find tenants in whom one can con-
fide.

   Population.-The population of this parish has fluctuated
very much.  In Dr Webster's account it was 448.  About
14 years ago it was as low as 260, after the old farmers
were removed.  Three years ago it was 471 examinable
persons, or about 550 of all ages; and at present it is only
about 450.

   Manufactures.-Small quantities of lint are raised for
private families; but the knitting of stockings is the only
manufacture of any consequence.
