   The manufacture of kelp has been much more fortunate
than that of linen yarn.  About the year 1730, it is said to
have been introduced, and had long to struggle hard against
the strong and rapid stream of popular prejudice.  Averse to
have any kind of labour introduced among them, but what
they had been accustomed to see and hear of, they represent-
ed to the proprietors, how hurtful that new business was like-
ly to be, for they could have no doubt of its driving the fish
from the coast, and it would therefore ruin the fishing; they
were certain it would destroy both the corn and the grass,
and they were much afraid, that it might even prevent their
women from having children.  As the price was very low
for the first ten years, the quantity made was but trifling.
From the year 1740 to 1760, the price is reported to have
been 45 s. per ton, and the money which it is believed to
have brought into the country during that period near about
2000 l. per annum.  The average price for the subsequent ten
years amounted to about four guineas per ton, and the whole
value to the place to above 6000 l. Sterling per annum.  Of
each ton at the market from the year 1770 to 1780, the
price rose at a medium to about 5 l. and the gross sum which
the proprietors in that time received for it was not less than
10,000 l. per annum.  For 13 years preceding the present
1791, the value of a ton was nearest to 6 l. and the quantity
each year to the sum of 17,000 l. Sterling.  Thus, in the
space of 50 years, the proprietors of these islands, where the
seasons are very deceitful, and the crops can by no means be
depended upon for sublisting the inhabitants, have received
in addition to their estates, the enormous sum of 370,000 l.
Sterling.  A sum of this extent introduced in a country
