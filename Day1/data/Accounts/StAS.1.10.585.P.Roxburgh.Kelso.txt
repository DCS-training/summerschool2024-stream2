     of Kelso.

   Government of the Town.-The Duke of Roxburgh, as lay
proprietor of the lands and abbey of Kelso, is Lord of the
Manor.  His Grace's ancestor, Sir Robert Ker of Cessford,
obtained this grant from James I. of England, ann. 1605,
on the forfeiture of Edward Earl of Bothwell, Admiral of
Scotland, when it was probably made a burgh of barony.
   Kelso is governed by a Baron Bailie, appointed by the
Duke, and fifteen stent-masters, of whom the Duke nomi-
nates seven.  The other eight consists of the Preses of the
Merchant Company, a Deacon Convener, the Deacons of
the five following Corporations, Hammermen, Skinners,
Shoemakers, Taylors, Weavers, and the Deacon of the But-
chers, although they are not incorporated.  The stent-ma-
sters, under the authority of the Baron Bailie, are entrusted
with the power of imposing a stent or tax upon the inhabi-
tants, as they judge their circumstances may afford.  This is
levied for the purpose of supplying the inhabitants with water,
conveyed by leaden pipes, to different parts of the town,
for repairing the streets, keeping the town clock in order,
paying part of the schoolmaster's salaries, and for several o-
ther incidents.

   Sects and Religious Houses.-Besides the established church,
and an Episcopal chapel, there are a number of sects, each
of which has a house for public worship, and some of them
are even elegant.  These are the kirk of Relief, Burghers,
Antiburghers, Cameronians, Methodists, and Quakers.  There
are three Roman Catholics, and one Jew in the parish.  The
major part of the inhabitants, particularly of the genteel
class, attend the parish church, and Episcopal chapel.  The
meeting-houses are chiefly supported by inhabitants of diff-
rent parishes in the vicinity.  This place, being centrical and
convenient, induces them to build here.  The Parochial
