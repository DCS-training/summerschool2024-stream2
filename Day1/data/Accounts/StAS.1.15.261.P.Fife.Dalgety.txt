part of the parish consists of a deep strong loam, mixed with
day, naturally wet and stiff, but productive in general of fer-
tile crops.  The ground, in most place, rises considerably a-
bove the level of the coast; but there are few hills in the pa-
rish, and these are neither high, nor much covered with
rocks.  The surface in some places is covered with heath,
and a few little hills with furze: there are also some small
mosses and swampy ground; but the space which these
occupy is of so little extent, that there is not above a
sixth part of the parish which is not arable.  The principal
crops raised in the parish are wheat, barley, oats, pease, and
beans.  Potatoes too age cultivated in considerable quantities,
and, in some places, partly used for seeding cattle.  Turnips
are also raised for this purpose, and grow to a considerable
size; but, on account of the wetness of the surface, and the
injury which the land might sustain in winter, by being cut
with horses and carts when they are carried off, they are not
generally used.  Tares are sometimes sown, and produce a-
bundant crops: Flax is seldom raised but for private use.  A
great part of the parish consists of grass grounds, which have
been laid down in good order, and, when let to graziers, yield
considerable rents.  From some inclosures, a proprietor has
been known to draw 2 L. 5 s. per acre; but the average rent of
the land in grass may be from 1 L. 5 s. to 1 L. 10 s. annually,
per acre.  A considerable number of black-cattle, and about
900 sheep, are usually grazed in the parish.

   Prices of Grain and Provisions.-The price of wheat and
barley is frequently regulated by the fiars of Mid Lothian.
Some farmers get the highest fiars for their grain, and others
in the Northern part of the parish, where the land is usually
of an inferior quality, sell somewhat lower.  Few oats are
sold in the parish and the price of oat meal is generally the
