     NUMBER XXXII.

     PARISH OF HAWICK.

     (County of Roxburgh-Presbytery of Fedburgh-Synod of
     Merse and Teviotdale.)

     By the Rev. Mr. ROBERT GILLAN.

     Name, Extent, and Appearance.

   ETYMOLOGY of names is generally matter of conjecture.
Hawick may be derived from the Celtic, ba, a mansion, and
wic, the crook or conflux of rivers; or from the Saxon, bas,
the same with our halved, and wick, a common termination
for a village, supposed to be formed from the Latin vica.  To
either of these derivations its situation agrees; as the river
Teviot washes the side of it towards the north, and the smaller
river, Slitridge, divides it nearly into two equal parts.-The
parish is of considerable extent, being about 15 miles long
from W. to E. and 4 1/2 broad.  The general appearance is hilly:
None of the hills, however, are of any remarkable size; they
are mostly green, and afford excellent pasture for sheep.
