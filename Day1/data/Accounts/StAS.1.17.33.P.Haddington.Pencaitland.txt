     NUMBER IV.

     PARISH OF PENCAITLAND.

     COUNTY AND PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON.-SYNOD
     OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDALE.

     By the Rev. Mr HENRY SANGSTER, Minister of Humbie.

     Form, Extent, River, and Surface.

   IT is nearly of the form of an oblong square, extending a-
bout 4 miles from E. to W. and 3 from S. to N.  The
river Tyne, running in a direction from W. to E. divides it
into 2 nearly equal parts, which rise from it by a gradual and
easy ascent; and the south, after rising nearly to a level with
the north part, slopes gently to the small rivulet of Kinchey,
which divides this from the parish of Ormiston.

   Soil, Cultivation, and Produce.-The soil in general is wet
and clayey, and consequently not adapted for the turnip sys-
tem.  The old East Lothian mode of farming is to be met
with here, and not the best mode even of it.  Upon two
farms, indeed, where the soil is sit for raising turnips, that
system is adopted, and, in the execution of it, there appears
a great degree of skill and attention.  One of them, posses-
sed by Mr ALEXANDER WIGHT, writer to the signet, has
exhibited, for some years past, a state of cultivation not sur-
passed, if equalled, in any part of this county.
