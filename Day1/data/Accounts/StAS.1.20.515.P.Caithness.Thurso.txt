into other corps, it was not without the assistance of other
parts of the kingdom, that three battalions of fencibles were
raised in the county, namely, the Rothesay and Caithness
Fencibles, of two battalions, commanded by Sir John Sin-
clair; and the Caithness Legion, of one battalion, com-
manded by Sir Benjamin Dunbar.

   SECT. II.  Volunteers.-This county has likewise given
ample proofs of its loyalty in the raising of volunteer
corps.  There are now nine companies embodied, each con-
sisting of sixty privates, with the usual number of officers,
non-commissioned officers, and drummers, attached to each
company; making in all an effective force of 640 men, in-
cluding officers.  Of these, five companies have offered their
service in any part of the united kingdom.  Nine additional
companies were lately offered to be raised, but the offer has
not been accepted.

   SECT. III.  Seamen for the Navy.-Before the American
war, the people of Caithness were very little inclined to en-
ter into the navy; but during that period, and since, this
county has furnished a good many seamen for the navy.
The collector of the Customs at Thurfo, in the course of
three years, engaged upwards of 70 men for that service;
and if the naval regulations would admit of paying bounties
to seamen upon their enlistment, instead of requiring their
being first mustered on board ship, there would be no diffi-
culty in finding men in Caithness to enter for the sea-service
upon any emergency.
