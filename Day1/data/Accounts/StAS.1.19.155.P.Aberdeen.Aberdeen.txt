coast.  On the north pier-head the Magistrates have recently
erected a signal staff, on which, when there is 9 feet water
on the bar, will be hoisted.  In the day time, a plain red flag,
and in the night a lighted lamp and a reflector.  They will

harbour open when the light, or flag staff bears W. and by

The best anchoring ground in Aberdeen Bay is in fix or

land floods, or in any other circumstance which would make

flounders of different kinds, halibut, plaise, soal, mackerel,
dog-fish, and occasionally herrings.  The fishermen of Foot-
