   Poor.-Assessments for the maintenance of the poor have
never been attempted here.  They are believed, and not
without reason, to encourage idleness and inconsiderate ex-
pences.  The charity of the parishoners would afford suffi-
cient aid to the parish poor, if it were not so much fore-

tificates, deserving of no regard.
   The average number of enrolled poor, for the 7 years from
1789 to 1795, inclusive of both years, is 61.  Among these,
the church-session dispenses all the cash in hand by half-
yearly distributions; the one in February; the other in
August; which last includes the meal of 3 bolls of bear:
L. 5, destined for clothing 12 children, is divided each No-
vember.

   Funds.-The parochial funds, from which these distribu-
tions are made, are, the Sabbath collections, with small fines
for illicit amours, and the dues of a velvet pall; all which
are booked, as they come in, both in the treasurer's ac-
