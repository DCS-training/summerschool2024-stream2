     Parish of Culter.

     Correction, by the Rev. William Strachan.

   In the Statistical Account of the parish of Culter, in the
presbytery of Biggar, formerly transmitted to you, it was
said, that the word Culter was a Latin one, signifying a
coulter or ploughshare, but on what account so called un-
certain.  This was the only definition I could at that time
procure, after a variety of enquiries at different people, who,
I supposed, might be able to give me information.  From
persons acquainted with the Gaelic language, I have since
learned, that Culter is a Gaelic word, and that the significa-
tion of it is, `the back, or hinder part, of the land or
country,' which exactly describes the situation of the parish;
the county of Lanark terminating with its boundaries on the
east and south-east, and there adjoining to Tweeddale.  A
question however here arises, v-iz.  Whether this name was
given before, or since the division into counties took place?
But however this may be, I am assured, by gentlemen who
understand the Gaelic, that the above is the true meaning of
the name.  In confirmation of which, I find that Buchanan,
in the 6th book of his History of Scotland, observes, that
the country adjoining from the Tay to the Forth was called
by the antients Ross, i.e. a `peninsula;' and, adds he,
"there are some signs of the name yet remaining, as Cul-
"ross, a town, which is, as it were, `the back; or hinder
"part,' of Ross."
