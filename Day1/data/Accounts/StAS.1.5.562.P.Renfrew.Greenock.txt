     Statistical Account

from the shore, the soil for the most part is thin, in some
places mossy; the bare rocks here and there appearing.
On the other side of these hills, except a few cultivated spots
in the descent to and on the banks of Grife, heath, com-
monly tall, and a coarse benty grass prevail.

   Minerals.-With respect ot fossils, the parish of Gree-
nock, as far as has been hiterto discovered, affords none
that are any way remarkable.  Along the soast, freestone,
mostly of a red colour, and sometimes beautifully variega-

sea pebble, of different shapes and hues, is most common.
The strata of this stone on the shore, and a great way a-

time failed, are very irregular, scarcely ever horizontal,
but dipping or inclining, at different angles in every di-
rection, and chiefly towards the south.  Limestone, though
much needed for building, and improvement of coarse stiff
grounds, has only been of late discovered, and but in small
quantities; nor is it of the best quality, being mixed with a
considerable proportion of land.  Farther search, it is to be
hoped, may be rewarded eith better success.  In the steep
banks of some of the numerous rivulets from the hills, and
in a thick bed of schislus, there appears a thin seam of it,
divided into pieces about the size of a man's head, and of
excellent quality.  These as they fall, (for the expence of
ground and labour, would far exceed their value,) are care-
fully collected, and used with good effect by the attentive
farmer.
   Whether it would be advisable to make trial for coal
in any part of the parish, those skilled in that business will
be best able to determine.  From the vast quantity used in
