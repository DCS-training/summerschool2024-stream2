zontally, or at least at a less angle than 45\d. The reedy appear-
ance on both is quite distinct. The Stigmaria also has been found.
  Town Hill Colliery.- At the Town Hill Colliery there have
been found some very fine specimens of the Lepidodendron in clay-
ironstone and in shale, and of the Calamites.

  Halbeath Colliery.-The tooth of a sauroid fish, named by M.
Agassiz, Megalychtis, was found a few years since in a bed of can-
nel coal at Halbeath, of which Leonard Horner, Esq. gave an
account in the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal for April
1836, contending, in opposition to the opinion of Dr Hibbert, that
it, as well as the same fish found in the limestone of Burdiehouse,
belongs to a marine, not a fresh water formation.
  This district abounds not only in coal, but in limestone, whin-
stone, sandstone, and a portion of ironstone.
  Limestone.-Limestone is found in the lands of Broomhall, Ros-
cobie, Lathalmond, Dunduff, Dunnygask, Craigluscar, Cowdens,
Brucefield, Southfod, and Sunnybank ; but is wrought for sale at
present only on the first four mentioned properties.
  There are altogether about 400,000 bushels of shells, and
15,000 tons of raw stone sold annually at Charleston. The burnt
lime is sold by the imperial standard measure, and the present
prices are,-

  There are nearly 60,000 bushels of shells sold annually at
Roscobie at 5 1/2d. per bushel.
  The limestone in the parish belongs to the mountain limestone
formation, and is of marine origin.
  The Charleston limestone has several varieties, the principal of
which are of a grey colour, with foliated structure, greyish brown
with splintery fracture, and compact ash-grey. These have been
found by careful analysis to contain carbonic acid from 40.25 to
42.3; lime from 47.05 to 51.6; magnesia from 0.92 to 2.59;
alumina from 0.95 to 1.8; silica from 2.76 to 7.9; iron from 0.28
to 0.56 ; with a very small proportion of manganese, carbon, sul-
phur, and naphtha. The limestone which contains the greatest
portion of naphtha, carbon, and sulphur, is also that which is low-
est in the stratification.*
