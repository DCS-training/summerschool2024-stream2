   The military road from Stirling to Fort William passes through
this parish 10 miles; 8 of which have lately been put in excellent
repair at the expence of Government; 2 miles are still very
bad, and there is so much up and down hill in the present di-
rection, that it cannot be made a tolerable road for carriages.
An alteration in the line has been proposed, which has this
season been inspected and approved of by Colonel Montgome-
ry; and it is hoped will be executed next summer.  As the com-
munication by Glenco and the ferry of Balachoalish to Fort
William is now opened, when the alteration near Lochearn-
head is made as proposed, the whole line from Edinburgh to
Fort William or Appin, will be easy and comfortable.  There
are several lines of communication through this parish, which
are yet only formed by the statute services.  As these services
are now converted into money, there will be a fund, which, if
properly managed, will in a few years make these roads tole-
rably good.  There are 2 excellent bridges, one of 3 arches, the
other of 2, built about 10 years ago upon the water of Bal-
vaig; and 5 bridges were built this year upon rapid burns in
different parts of the parish by subscriptions in the country,
with a small aid from the county funds.-Good roads and easy
access to markets are to be numbered among the advantages of
this parish.  Want of manufactures, and scarcity of fuel, are
