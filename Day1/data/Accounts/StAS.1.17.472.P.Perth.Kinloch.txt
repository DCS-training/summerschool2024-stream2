   If you sow flax seed for the second or third crop on marl-
ed ground, that is, while the influence of the ground is most
powerful, though the crop will have a promising appearance
till the beginning, or towards the middle of July, when the
plant is about 7 or 8 inches long, about this time, (under
the strong influence of the sun), the swelling and agitation
of the earth, occasioned by the powerful operation of the
marl, break the tender fibres of this plant, while in its
quickest growth, and cause it to decay.

   Agriculture, etc.-This parish produces wheats barley,
oats, pease, flax, potatoes, and turnip.  Clover and rye-grass
seeds are sown extensively.  Potatoes are planted in much
greater quantities, than they were a few years ago.  Besides
their great utility for the table, they are found to be excel-
lent food for horses and black cattle, and are used as such.
A light, dry, or sandy soil, is best for potatoes.  The pota-
toe called the London Lady is the best of the early species
of potatoes yet known in this parish.  The red-nosed-white
kidney potatoe, and the long-white-kidney potatoes which
are equally great or thick at both ends, are the best eating
of the late species of potatoes; and the last mentioned of
these is equally prolific with the common-late-round-white
potatoe.  The dark red Lancashire potatoe, if planted in a
very dry sandy soil, is more prolific than any other of the
species above mentioned; it is also more solid, a measure-full
of this species, outweighing considerably the same measure-
full of any of the others.  The above mentioned different
species are the best of all the variety of potatoes cultivated
in this country.  It has been found here by repeated expe-
riments, that the best method of preventing potatoes from
degenerating, and of rendering them more prolific, is to raise
potatoes now and then from the seed that grows upon the
