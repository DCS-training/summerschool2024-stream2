neighbouring parish of Kilmartin, by which the alarm
might be spread 20 miles into the country, in the course   
a few minutes; and, according to tradition, the natives as-
sembled at the sight of the alarm signal, ad rushed onward
to the place from whence the first signal came, till they
met the enemy; and some very large stones erected on end,
which tradition calls the tombs of heroes, with several
cairns near the coast, in which tombs containting urns have
been found, show that the low grounds of this and the
neighbouring parish, have been keenly contested.

   Roads and Bridges.-The roads in the parish, and through
most of the country, were formerly wrought by the statute-
labour; but in this manner they were never properly exe-
cuted, nor kept in any tolerable repair.  About 20 years
ago the heritors of the county awoke from their lethargy
to this first and most material improvement, and got an act
of Parliament passed, specifying the different public lines
through the county, and imposing 1 s. in the pound valuation
as road stent; and to expede the execution of these lines,
the most of them advanced at once 15 years road stent.
And I know that the principal heritors of this district not
only showed their public spirit on this, but some of them
borrowed a few hundreds upon their own security, to finish
the lines within the parish, when the cash advanced was
exhausted; so that in the course of a few years, 12 miles of
road, 24 feet wide, was sufficiently executed on the E. and
S. E. side of the parish, making part of the line from Inve-
rary to Campbelltown, and 6 miles from Lochgilphead up
the country, by the W. and N. W. side, making part of
the line that is to join the Lorn district.  But the forcing of
these roads to rapidly has so far mortgaged the funds, that
the unaffected at present are not sufficient to keep the road
