     of Carluke.

living among them for about 30 years, the present incumbent
can say with truth, that they are in general of good under-
standings, moderate in their views, and of humane disposi-
tions.  Among those who attend the Established Church, there
is scarce an instance, either of wild enthusiasm, or of a per-
secuting and cruel spirit.  Profanity, drunkenness, swearing,
dishonesty, etc. are by no means prevalent.  The general body
of the people, are regular in their attendance on public wor-
ship, sober and virtuous.  No child murder has been known
to be committed here in the memory of man.  The discipline
of the church has been always exercised with mildness.  In
ordinary cases, only one appearance is now required, and
antenuptial fornication dismissed with a sessional rebuke, like a
private marriage; so that none are hardened by frequent ap-
pearances; and marriage is encouraged in all.  To conclude;
in some parts of this parish, much benefit is derived from the
great improvement which has been lately made, by gentlemen
of taste and public spirit, in the houses of their tenants.-
By being built neat and commodious, well aired, and properly
lighted, they are found to cherish, among those who inhabit
them, a spirit of cleanliness and cheerfulness, and to contri-
bute materially to their health.  In such places accordingly,
the people can live with more comfort and happiness than for-
merly; they associate more frequently together; they culti-
vate their farms more vigorously; they procure better
prices for their commodities; and, being thus enabled to dress
more decently, and to make a better appearance on public oc-
casions, they have thence an additional inducement, to attend
with more regularity, the important ordinances of religion.
