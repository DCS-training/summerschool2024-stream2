   Manners and Morals.-The people of this parish, in ge-
neral, are fober and industrious, free from gross crimes,
tractable and submissive.  They, as well as the people of
the neighbouring parishes, have made a greater progress in
civilization within the last 50 years, than for several centu-
ries before.  This is owing, first, to the decline of the fen-
dal system.  Before the year 1745, that system had consider-
able influence.  Every chief considered himself as an inde-
pendent prince, who might commit depredations on his
neighbours territories, as avarice or animosity dictated.
