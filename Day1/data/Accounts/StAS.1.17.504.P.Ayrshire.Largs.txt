scenes.  The hills, which begin to rise in the neighbouring
parishes of Greenock, Kilmacolm, Lochwinnoch, Kilbirny,
and Dalry, meet in a kind of general summit at the eastern
boundary of Largs, from which they gradually descend
as they approach the shore, till they terminate at last in a va-
riety of abrupt declivities, some of which are almost perpen-
dicular, as if part of their base had been torn away by force.
Notwithstanding the vast height of these hills, they are
covered, during the greater part of the year, with verdure,
and afford such excellent pasture for sheep, and some of
them for larger cattle, as can hardly be found elsewhere in
similar situations.
   The quantity of heath, even on the highest hills, is com-
paratively small; and, from indisputable marks it appears, that
some of them have once been cultivated.

   Soil, Agriculture, and Produce.-The whole extent of the
parish of Largs may, from several surveys, none of which are
entirely accurate, be estimated at 19,743 acres.  The estate
of Brisbane alone, with the fues belonging to it, contains
9,748 acres, 2 falls, and 27 perches.  The arable lands in
the parish, consist of about 4200 acres, rather more than one
fifth of the whole.  The rest of it is now wholly appropria-
ted to pasture, though a far greater proportion bears evident
marks of the plough.  About a thousand acres of the higher
grounds are of little value; the rest, however, is excellent
for feeding sheep and rearing young cattle.  In the lower
grounds a number of cattle are fattened, so as to find a ready
market in Greenock and other neighbouring towns.  One
stock farm, the property of the Earl of Glasgow, yields very
near 500 L. yearly, neat rent; and several farmers, whose
cattle are fed upon the pasture grounds only, make consider-
able quantities of butter and cheese.
