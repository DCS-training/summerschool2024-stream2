     Statistical Account

of the parishioners report, though without much credibility,
that Gregory the Great was buried in the parish; and there
are several predictions current among the country people, at-
tributed by them to Thomas the Rhymer, which it would be
unnecessary to recite.  There are two old houses in the pa-
rish; one of them, Asstoune was built between two and
three hundred years ago, and seems to have been a place of
some strength.  It was a square building, with a round tower
at each of two opposite angles, of which there is one still re-
remaining, though the greater part of the house was pulled
down 40 years ago.  The first storey was all vaulted, and
there was a well in one of the vaults; but the towers were a
continuation of one vault above another to the roof.
   About two thirds of the parish belongs to one proprietor,
who is an occasional resident, and the remainder is divided a-
mong five others, two of whom reside constantly.  The va-
lued rent is 3126 L. 12 s. 8 d. and the neat rent may be about
1500 L. 19 s. Sterling.

   Animals.-The Don abounds with trout, and, after high
floods, with salmon, which, when the river is low, cannot get
up on account of the crieve dykes, near its mouth.  There are
no pikes, and few eels in this part of its course.  A bridge over
the Don in the line of the great northern road, would be
highly serviceable to this country.  Besides the Don, there
are several inferior streams, which pass through the parish,
well stocked with trout, &c.  Upon one of them the Lochel,
a bridge was built by Mr Melvine, then clergyman of this
parish, in the end of the last century, and it is still kept in
good repair, by a mortification of 100 merks, which he left
in the charge of the minister and kirk session, for that purpose.
   In the parish there are a few Red and Roe Deer, lately at-
tracted to the country by the extensive plantations; and we
have foxes, polecats, weasels the Scotch ermine, and the Mus-
