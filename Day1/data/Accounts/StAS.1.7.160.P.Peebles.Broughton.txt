     Statistical Account

labour having been performed, nor commutation money up-
lifted, for the last ten years.-There is only one bridge in the
parish over Biggar water, about a quarter of a mile from the
village; and, being upon public road, and of great advan-
tage to travellers, the water in the winter season being often
impassable, is kept in tolerably good repair.

   School.-There is only one school in the parish, salary 5 l.
16 s. 8 d. which, with school wages and other perquisites,
may amount to the small living of 11 l. or 12 l. yearly; and,
for that sum, from 20 to 30 scholars are regularly instructed
in the different branches of education.
   There is one inn and two alehouses in the village.

   Cottages.-There are no new houses built in the parish of
late, nor cottages, but a great many cottages pulled down,
the farmers finding more loss than profit arising from the
keeping up of cot houses: The throwing down of cottages
must be one principal reason of the decrease of popula-
tion in country parishes, and of the increase of population
in towns and villages and a principal reason of the scarcity
of servants, and the increase of their wages; the poor people
being banished from the country, take up their residence in
towns, and breed their children to manufactures, who would
otherwise have all been bred to the plough; and, if manu-
factures continue to flourish, and this growing evil, of throw-
ing down cottages, and banishing the poor from the country
parts of parishes, is not speedily corrected, it is more than
probable that servants for carrying on the purposes of agri-
culture will not be obtained.
   There is one fair in the year in the village, held upon the
4th of October, originally for black cattle, but how chiefly
for the hiring of servants; and the storemasters selling their
cheese.
