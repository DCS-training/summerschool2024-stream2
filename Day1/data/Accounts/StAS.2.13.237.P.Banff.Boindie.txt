   About L. 60 yearly rent, on an average, is drawn by the pro-
prietor from the fishing-boats. The proprietor furnishes each crew
with one boll meal and 100 merks Scots, to aid in buying a new
boat once in seven years, if required. For about an acre and a
quarter of potato land, and the use of the boat, a crew pay L. 5
yearly rent. A good boat for the haddock-fisbing costs L. 17,
and will run eleven or twelve years. Instead of receiving the above
allowance, and giving up the boat to the proprietor at tbe end of
seven years, the fishermen are now agreeing to pay L. 4 per an-
num each crew for right of fishing, including potato land, with
freedom to possess boats of their own. Men above sixty years of
age are allowed to fish free of rent. Muscle bait is brought an-
nually from Sutherlandshire. Price of a boat's cargo, L. 3, be-
sides the labour of gathering.
   The lobster-fishery is prosecuted by five or six boat crews by
means of basket-nets, and the produce sent to London periodical-
ly in the well smacks. 1100 lobsters were caught last season, price
4d. each. The large number which die greatly increase the price
to the purchasers.
   The salmon-fishery has been carried on of late years by bag-
nets at Blackpots, near Wbitehills, with progressively increasing
success. The average produce from 1834 to 1837 amounted to
about L.225 yearly. The salmon are  either iced, or boiled and
pickled with vinegar, and forwarded to the London market. The
rent, understood to be paid by a subtenant for the fishery carried
on here and at Findochty, may be estimated for the Boindie sta-
tion, at L. 50, one-half of the whole, besides twenty per cent. on
the fish caught above a certain amount.
   The average gross amount of raw produce may be estimated as
follows :-

1600 acres grain, 5 qrs. per acre, at L.1, 7s. 6d. including fodder, L.11,000  0  0
