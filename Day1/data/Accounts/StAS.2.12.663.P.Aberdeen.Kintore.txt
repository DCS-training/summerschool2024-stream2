bions, it is thought, would add considerably to the value of both
the great properties in the parish.  It has been calculated that a
new cut of 528 yards would shorten its course 2280 yards, and
reclaim 21 1/4 acres of land, which might soon be made of fine qua-
lity.

                     V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   There are several very good shops in the burgh of Kintore,
which supply the neiglibourhood with all commodities for common
use; but Aberdeen being distant only twelve miles, and the means
of conveyance numerous, almost every article of merchandise of a
superior description is purchased there.
   The post-office here is that of longest standing in the district
of Garioch.  The great northern road runs along the whole length
of the parish, namely six miles, and a branch of it extends to the
west, a distance of three miles towards Kemnay, and ultimately
joins the Alford turnpike.  Three stage-coaches, besides the Royal
Mail, pass twice through Kintore daily.
   The Aberdeenshire canal terminates at Port Elphinstone in the
parish of Kintore.  This is a work of great importance.  It has
proved extremely beneficial to a large and populous tract of coun-
try.  When originally constructed it was only 17 feet wide and 3
feet deep; but these dimensions have since been enlarged, and it
is now from 21 to 23 feet in width, and about 3 3/4 feet in depth,
Its length from the harbour of Aberdeen to Port Elphinstone is
18 1/4 miles, of which about a third part lies within this parish.  It
was opened in 1807.  The expense of its construction and subse-
quent enlargement amounted to. nearly L.50,000.  And though
it has unquestionably accelerated improvement very much in this
quarter, the shareholders receive but a low rate of interest as yet
on the money expended.  The trade on the canal, however, is
