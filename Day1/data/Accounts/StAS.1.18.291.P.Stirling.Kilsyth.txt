yield so much upon a lease of 19 years.  In general the
rents are very low in this parish, as the leases were many of
them granted about the beginning of this century.  An acre
in potatoes or flax, if prepared for the crop, lets at L. 6
sterling.
   The wages of servants have risen in a still greater pro-
portion.  They are nearly triple to what they were even 40
years ago.  Independent of his food, a ploughman expects
from L. 10 to L. 12; a maid servant from L. 3 to L. 4.  A.
hay cutter charges 2 s. 6 d. a day, a reaper in harvest 2 s. a.
female do. 1 s. 6 d. When engaged by the week and finding
his own provisions, a man receives 9 s. and a female 7 s
weekly.  A weaver can earn from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s. 6 d. a day at
an average.

   Antiquities, etc.-The antiquities in this parish are
not very remarkable: yet a few deserve a place in this ac-
count.
   This district must have been the scene of contention, and
the field of blood for many generations; perhaps from the
days of Agricola, till the civil war in 1646.  It seems to
have been without the fixed limits of the Roman empire.
For the south boundary of the parish runs nearly parallel to
Graham's Dyke for upwards of 6 miles. In that district of
the wall, it is never more than half, nor less than a quar-
ter of a mile south of this parish.  At Westerwood, and
Bar hill, there are two distinct Roman Forts; and of
course, two Pictish forts in this parish corresponding to
these:  Cunny park to the former, and Balcastle to the
latter.  The last mentioned is by much the most remark-
able.  It is perhaps the most beautiful, regular, and entire
of any Pictish fort in Scotland.  It is placed in the angle
of two small rills, near a farm house called Castle town,
