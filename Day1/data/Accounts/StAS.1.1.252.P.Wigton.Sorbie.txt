     Statistical Account

monly granted for 19 years.  Lord Galloway has two upon
his estate here of 21 years, and the life of the farmers.  The
size of farms is from 300 to 30 acres.

   Church and Stipend.-The church was completely repair-
ed about 30 years ago.  The manse was rebuilt in 1778.
The stipend is L. 75 per annum  The glebe, including grass
and arable land, garden, and site of the manse and office-
houses, does not amount to 10 acres.  Of these there are 4
acres of the worst land in the neighbourhood.  They were
never thought worth ploughing till the present incumbent re-
ceived them.  There are 7 heritors.  The Earl of Galloway
is the only resident one.  Dr Davidson, and Elliot William
Davidson, his only son, are the present ministers.  The for-
mer was admitted November 1775; the latter was ordained,
September 3- 1789, assistant and successor.  The King is pa-
tron.

   Poor.-There are 13 poor on the list.  About L. 27 Ster-
ling per annum is distributed among them, chiefly raised by
collections in the church.  The legal manner of treating pau-
pers was adopted here anno 1776; that is, they were obliged
to use badges, and to confine themselves within the bounds
of the parish.  The distinction was very disagreeable to them;
and it was found that some of them had hoarded up money.
The present incumbent has never had an improper applica-
tion from a native for admission to the public charity.

   Price of Labour, Fuel, etc.-Common day labourers are
paid, one quarter of the year, 10 d. per day; for the other
three quarters 1 s.; carpenters 1 s. 4 d.; masons 1 s. 6 d.;
taylors 6 d. or 8 d.
