of its branches, and, penetrating all the way down one side
of the trunk. tore up and laid open the roots of the same
side.  Since that time, one half of the tree has decayed,
while the other remained healthy.  The bark was entire
all around the trunk; but the healthy branches continued
yearly to decrease a little.  No farther observations, how-
ever, can now be made upon it: for though it appeared to
be a great natural curiosity, yet the proprietor, it seems, has
not considered it in this point of view, and, not thinking
of the philosophical purposes to which it might have been
subfervient, has lately cut it down.
   This parish still opens a wide field for improvements of
various kinds.  There was formerly a ferry boat on the
river Forth, opposite the village of Clackmannan.  This
would still be of great use and convenience to the country,
both to the north and south.  The harbour at Clackman-
nan Pow, by a small expense, may be rendered a safe and
convenient landing place.  And a village also might be
built at that place, so as to have many advantages of situa-
tion.
   The whole country of Clackmannan, and this parish in
particular, has long laboured under the greatest inconve-
nience, from the uncommonly bad state of the public
roads.  Fortunately, however, the gentlemen of the coun-
ty have at last got their eyes opened to their true interest.
A turnpike road bill for this country is just now depending
in Parliament, and with every prospect of success.
