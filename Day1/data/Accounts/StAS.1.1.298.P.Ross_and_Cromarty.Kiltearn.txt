ter from the Elector Palatine to his envoy at London, de-
firing him to thank the King of Great Britain, in his name,
for the excellent behavior of the Highland regiment, while
they were in his territories, "which,(as he says expressly)
" was owing to the care of Sir Robert Munro, their lieute-

" pay a regard to a Scotsman for the future."  Sir Harry
Munro, son to Sir Robert just mentioned, was highly distin-

settled minister at Kiltearn in 1655, but was turned out at
the restoration to make way for an Episcopal minister.  He
suffered much persecution, being long imprisoned in the Bass:
