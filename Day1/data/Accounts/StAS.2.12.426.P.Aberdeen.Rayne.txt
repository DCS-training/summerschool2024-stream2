on the east side of the same hill; and on the top of it are two large
stones, not far apart, called the Crighton Stone, and the Fede-
raught Stone, which are probably commemorative of some feud,
or fatal encounter betwixt the Crightons of Frendraught, in For-
gue, and the family of Federaught in Deer.  The west of this
hill looks to one about a mile distant, in the neighbouring parish
of Culsamond, called Cairnhill, whereon are several cairns or
barrows; by which passed a Roman road, leading, as is supposed,
from the large encampment south of the river Dee, to the camp
of Glenmellan near the Ythan, (castra ad Ithunum,) and with
this latter the Black Cairn may have been in some way connected.
At Freefield a mile southward from Cairnhill, is an artificial grassy
mound of 60 yards in circumference, and 18 feet in height, pro-
bably a signal post, having relation to the supposed Roman
way, above-mentioned.  Near the church is a large flat-head-
ed rock, called Bowman Stone, where archers may have met
in ruder times to practise with the bow; as at the Bowbutts in
other places.  Half a mile east from this, is a rising ground nam-
ed Saint Andrew's Hill, on which fetes may have formerly been
held in honour of the patron saint; and a mile eastward from
that, is a round knoll or eminence on the lands of Meikle Wart-
hill, called the Earl of Marr's Reive or Ree.
   Modern Buildings.-The church, is a plain structure, erected
in 1789 for L.350 Sterling.  The mansion-houses are those of Free-
field and Rothmaise, built in the last century; and that of Wart-
hill, in the present century.  Freefield is surrounded with ash, beech,
larch, and pine trees, of great height and beauty, and also with
some Spanish chestnut trees, which blossom but do not bear fruit.
There are five meal-mills in the parish, of which three are slated;
and forty-four thrashing-mills for grain, of which ten are moved
by water, and the rest by horses.
