nails appear all to have been made by a country-smith, ac-
cording to the times; the bonnets being as broad as s
smal halfpenny.  Afterward the country-people got
the small-framed saw.  There being no demand for deals,
neither did they know how to send them out of the coun-
try, the heritors took any thing they could get for the
wood that was manufactured.  It is not a very long time
back since the Laird of Grant got only a merk a-year, for
