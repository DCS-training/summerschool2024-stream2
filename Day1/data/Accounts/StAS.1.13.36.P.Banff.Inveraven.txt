No register of burials is kept in the parish, nor could it be
easily done; because, besides the church-yard, there are two      
other burying places, one upon the east side of Livet, near 4
miles from the parish-church, near the walls of the old cha-
pel of Dounan; and another, almost 5 miles higher up the
glen, on the west side of Cromby, and opposite to the Bo-

*The Papists were never forward to enter the baptisms of their chil-
dren into the parish register.  Their marriages unless when the priest mar-
ried them clandestinely, were generally registered, because their marriage
banns were regularly proclaimed in the church.  But since the repeal of
the penal statutes in England, they publish their marriage banns at their
mass-house, and not at the church; and never insert either their marriages
or baptisms in the parochial register; whereby the taxes, appointed by law,
are evaded, and the schoolmaster, who is session-clerk and keeper of the 
parochial register, loses his dues, which are part of the emoluments of his
office.  Some years ago, I was told by some Papists, that their priests for-
bade them to enter their childrens baptisms in the parish register, because
they kept a list of the children they baptized.  And it must be acknow-
ledged that many of the poorer sort among the Protestants often omit to
enter their childrens baptisms in the parish register, on account of the tax,
and the dues of the clerk for inserting them.
