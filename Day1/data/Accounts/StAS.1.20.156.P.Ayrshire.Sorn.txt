of coarse coal.  The former practice had been to work only
the lower seam, leaving about 6 inches of it for a roof; but I
have lately gone back, and brought away both that roof and
the next 18 inches of coal.  The field is irregular below,
having many steps, throwing the coal up and down, a cir-
cumstance which increase the expence of working it.  Had
we a sale for iron-stone the case would be very different, as
these steps are composed chiefly of that mineral.  My pre-

   "By a memorandum in our charter-book it appears,
that, ever since the year 1623, the standard Gilmillscrost
coal-creel was 14 inches wide, 16 inches deep, and 30

the year 1497.  We continue nearly the same measure for
half a load, now sold at 3 d. of which about 7 load make
20 cwt."

There is also a string of load at Hollhouse-mill; and the
spar at the Burntshiel-burn is promising.  In the river of
Ayr there is water sufficient for any machinery, and abun-
dance of fall every quarter of a mile."

   Roads and Bridges.-About 25 years ago there was no-
thing, of any extent, in this parish that could properly de-
serve the name of a road.  Happily, however, the case is
now very different.  Beside half-a-dozen of private roads,
made at the expence of the respective proprietors, the parish
is now intersected by 3 public roads.  One of these, leading
from Glasgow to Dumfries by Galston, passes through the
centre of the parish, from north to south.  This road is cros-
