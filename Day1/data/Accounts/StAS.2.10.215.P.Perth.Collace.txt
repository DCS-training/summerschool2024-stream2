the nature of the soil and climate, wheat and beans are not always
profitable.  The green crop system is therefore commonly follow-
ed-a five-shift rotation, including two years in grass, has been
found most advantageous, and best adapted to the soil.  Plough-
men's wages from L. 12 to L. 14 per annum, with the usual al-
lowance of meal and milk; women's wages, from L. 6 per an-
num to L. 6, 6s. ; mason's and carpenter's from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per
day ; day-labourers 1s. 6d.  In winter, their wages are proportion-
ally less.  Women employed at out-door work, 8d. per day; when
lifting potatoes, 1s. without victuals.

In the above calculations, the green crop (with the exception
of part of the hay and potatoes) is understood to be consumed on
the farms, which is the practice generally followed in this parish.
A few horses are reared for sale, the breed of which, as also of
the cattle, being very much attended to, have greatly improved of
late years.  A considerable number both of cattle and sheep are fed
off every winter, and disposed of at a fair profit to the butcher.  The
farm-steadings are among the best in the country, and kept in ex-
cellent repair.  The principal farms are let on leases of nineteen
years-those of small dimensions for shorter periods.
 Manufactures.-The produce of the loom has long been our
staple article of commerce, and has of late greatly increased.  In
the prngress of human improvement, it has been ascertained, that
yarn fit for being woven into linen cloth, can be produced by ma-
chinery, not only cheaper and better, but also in inconceivably
greater quantities, than by the former tedious means of hard la-
bour-a new direction has thus been given to the industry of this,
and of many other parishes in Scotland.  The spinning-wheel has
been entirely superseded, or used only for the very refuse of flax;
and the spinsters, thrown out of their old and congenial employ-
ment, have been obliged to have recourse to the loom.  In weav-
ing the lighter fabrics, we are happy to find they are succeeding
