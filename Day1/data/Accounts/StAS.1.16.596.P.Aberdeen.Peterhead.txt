sellors.  The bailie is named by the superiors, and has his
commission from them; the counsellors are chosen annually
by the feuers, at a general meeting called for that purpose;
4 of these are chosen from among the merchants, 2 from
the shipmasters, and 2 from the trades.  The bailie exer-

to this part of the town, but all the boats st present belong
to the Ronheads, the north east part of the town, where the
fishermen, sailors, pilots, and a few shipmasters reside.
Here there are 9 boats, which employ about 40 hands; all
these fishermen are likewise pilots, and are therefore not so
steady in catching fish as the people in Boddom; they are
