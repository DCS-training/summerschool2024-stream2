N. Corra-Bhein, the Steep Peak.  These peaks are seen from
the continent of Argyllshire, and from part of Perthshire,  
from Buteshire, Ayrshire, Dumbartonshire, and, it is said,
from part of Lanarkshire.  They are seen at a great distance
to the W., and are the first land which the sailors make, com-
ing in their direction from the Atlantic Ocean.  There is very
little vegetation on these peaks, their summits and sides are
covered over with fragments of stone, and exhibit a stupen-
dous monument of the resistless force of time.  The W. side
of the island is not fit for cultivation; it is wild and rugged,
intersected with many torrents, which come rushing down
from the mountains; and has been deemed so inhospitable,

habitants live on the E. side of the island.  Along the margin
of the sea, on this side, the grounds are pretty level; but at
a little distance from the shore, there is a gradual ascent.  The
whole of this side forms no unpleasing scene.  The coast is,
in several places, variegated with bays and harbours, and
points of land; the arable and pasture grounds spread on a 
declivity before the eye, and terminate at the base of those
towering mountains, which form a romantick and awful back-
ground.

   Air, Climate, and Diseases.-The air is pure and salubri-
ous, as it is generally in the sea-coast, and in hilly countries.
The clouds are, indeed, often intercepted by the high hills,
and descend in torrents; but we have constant breezes, some-
times brisk gales of wind, to dry up the rain.  The tops of
the mountains are covered with snow a considerable part of 
winter, but is seldom lies long on the low grounds.  The in-
habitants are very healthy, and many of them live to old
age.  A few weeks ago, died, a lady at the age of 96.  She
retained the use of her faculties to the last.  Till within a
