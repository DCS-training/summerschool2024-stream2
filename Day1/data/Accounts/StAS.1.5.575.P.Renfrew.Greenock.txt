with shell fish of various kinds.  In high gales of N. E.
wind, it is of no small service to the road and harbour of
Greeenock.  At the bottom, or tail (as it is usually called)
of this bank, and which, as a loosing place, experienced
mariners prefer to any other harbour in the frith, there is,
at all times, sufficient depth of water, abundance of room,
and good anchoring ground for hundreds of ships, of any
burden hitherto built.  Directly opposite to the tail of the 
bank, where the channel is narrowest, tradition says, there
was anciently a sort or castle.  On the spot, which still
retains the name of The Forth, or Fort, a battery was raised
during the war before last, on occasion of the alarm given

M. THUROT; and, on a similar alarm, by some privateers
in the beginning of the American war, a still more formi-

flanked by several brass pieces, 12 and 9 pounders, en bar-

the direction of a party of the artillery.  People, however,
who know the winds necessary to bring vessels into the
port, and to carry them out to sea, will probably be of
opinion, that all this labour and expence might have been
spared.  None but a madman would think of attempting
a port, from which his escape would be almost impossible.
   As to the harbour, properly so called, the inhabitants
of Greenock, in the year 1700, petitioned the Scotch Par-
liament for a fund to build it; which petition, for what
reason does not appear, the Parliament absolutely refused.
Some time after, they entered into a contract with their
