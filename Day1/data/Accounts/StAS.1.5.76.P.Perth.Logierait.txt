     Statistical Account

   Scenery, Hills, Lakes, Rivers, etc.-A rock, not above
a mile from the church, commands a prospect of a great
part of the parish.  The windings of the rivers, the rich
vales, the sloping corn fields and pastures, the hanging
woodlands, and the awful mountains which rise at a dis-
tance to confine the view, form, all together, one of the
noblest landscapes, for extent, variety, beauty and gran-
deur, that the eye can behold.  The land upon the banks
of the rivers is chiefly arable; much of the rising ground,
too, which confines the vales, is also cultivated, where the
declivities are not too steep for the course of the plough.
About the middle of Strath-Tay, and in several places on
both sides of the Tummel, the woodlands extend to the
very brink of the river.  The hills are partly covered with
heath; but in some parts exhibit nothing but bare rocks.
The lands, wherever arable, are moderately fertile.  The
air is dry, and not unhealthy.  The water through the
parish is abundantly pure and wholesome.  Besides the ri-
vers Tay and Tummel, there are several small lakes; and
some farms belonging to Logierait, border upon Loch Ran-
noch, a body of water ten miles in length, and, from a mile,
to a mile and a half broad.  The rivers frequently over-
flow their banks; and on such occasions never sail to en-
large their channels, by breaking down some part of their
banks, in one part or another.  The greatest floods that
have been known here, within the present century, hap-
pened in the year 1761.

   Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals.-Our rocks have no-
thing singular in their composition or aspect.  They afford
indeed a variety of talc; which is found in many other places
through the north of Scotland.  On one side of Strath-Tay,
too, are several strata of lime-stone.  Fossil wood is occa-
