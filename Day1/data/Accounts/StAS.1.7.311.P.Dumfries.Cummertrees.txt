a burying place walled in, adjoining to the tower.  In the
lime-stone quarries of Kilhead, several veins of a beautiful
spotted dark coloured marble have appeared, and large blocks
of it being cut out, have been worked up for chimneys and
hearths, some of which have been sent to London.  This
marble is of a dark colour, and is mixed with shells, petrified
vegetables, and other bodies, which greatly add to its variety
and beauty, as the whole receives a very fine polish.

   Feuel.-Peats are the only feuel used in this parish; the
casting and preparing of which, during the summer, con-
sumes much of the time, which the people ought to dedicate
to the improvement of their farms.  From this labour, they
would be in a great measure relieved, if coal was either found
in this country, or allowed to be imported free of duty, from
the opposite shore of the Solway Frith.
