founded here in 1272, by Alexander Cumin Earl of Buchan.
This hospital was, among others, dedicated (Sancto Congano)
to St Congan, supposed to be the tutelary saint of the place,
from whom one of the annual fairs held here is called
Cowan Fair.  It was endowed with an yearly payment of 5
chalders of grain, instead of the tythes of the Castle of Ke-
nedar, and a piece of land called Knockaibie.  This piece
of land, according to the description of its situation and
marches, in the charter of foundation, comprehended all the
land, except Balmellie, presently astricted to the Mill of
Turreff.  The hospital was to contain a master and 6 chap-

furnish with a dwelling-house, and to maintain 13 decayed
husbandmen from the country of Buchan.  The hospital was
to be a sanctuary for criminals; but the master was bound to
deliver up for trial all manifest malefactors; and if any of the
people of the lands belonging to the hospital (over which the
Earl of Buchan retained the right of criminal jurisdiction)
should be capitally convicted, their escheat was to belong to
the hospital.  This charter is dated at Kellie, on Sunday af-
ter Candlemas 1272, in presence of William Earl of Mar,
Lord Allan Hostear, Lord Regenalde Chen, Lord Andrew
of Germack, Lord Philip of Melgredum, Meldrum of that
ilk, sequestrated by Urquhart of Meldrum, Lord John of
Malville, Lord William of Melgdrum, Walter, rector of the
church of Foverne, and Robert de Lylie, rector of the church
of Slains, etc.  By another charter, dated at Kenkell the
16th of October 1328, in presence of Randolph Earl of Mo-

Hay Constable, etc. it appears that this hospital was farther
