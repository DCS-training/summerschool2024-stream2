   3.  East Newton, the property of James Dickson of An-
ton's-hill, Esq; consists of about 250 acres, much exceeding
indeed in moisture, but containing more good, dry, and
fertile ground than the former.  It is rented at L. 160,
upon a lease nearly expiring; and this farm, along with
17 detached acres at the north-east corner of it, rented at
L. 17, and amounting, with the rent of East Newton, to
L. 177, constitutes the property of Mr Dickson in this pa-
rish at present.

   4.  Langrigg is, as its name implies, a long narrow strip of
land, consisting of 155 acres Scots measure, or 186 English.
It is low, but well improved and skilfully cultivated, as it
has very long been in the occupation of the proprietor, its
rent cannot be precisely ascertained, but it is not over-rated
in its present state at L. 1 Sterling per acre, and of course
gives L. 186.  It is the property of Joshua Tart, Esq; and
gives a vote for a Member of Parliament.  This estate
pays only 6 s. 8 d. to the minister, the supposed conversion
of a boll of oats of old; the new stipend not yet localled.

   5.  Ravelaw and East-Laws, the property of Sir Alex-
ander Don, Baronet, occupied in one farm, consists of 466
acres, the rent of which is L. 372.  Along with some wet,
marsh, low lying ground, it contains no small proportion of
good, fertile, dry, and well exposed ground, well improved,
and skilfully cultivated.

   6.  In our progress, there occur certain small portions of
ground, too small to constitute a farm, yet not to be omit-
ted in this account of the parish.  1st, the 17 detached
acres at the north-east corner of East Newton, already
mentioned as part of the property of James Dickson, Esq;
occupied by one family; there few acres are exceedingly
