     of Lismore and Appin.

is an excellent line of road, mostly finished, from Shian Ferry
through Airds, Strath of Appin, Duror, and Glenco, to the 
King's House at lubnamart, with 6 or 7 bridges for a course
of 17 or 18 computed miles, besides several by roads.  Last
year a line of road has been opened to Glencreren.  There
has been little done to the roads in Lismore.  There are no
tolls in the Highlands.

   Post-Office.  When the present incumbent came to the pa-
rish, and several years afterwards, the nearest post-office was
at Inverary; and a few of the gentlemen of Appin employed
a runner, who went once a week to inverary to bring their
letters, newspapers, etc.  Mr Seaton of Toach, who bought 
the estate of Appin (a gentleman particularly attentive to
the good of the parish, and of the country in general) after
much trouble and solicitation, got a post-office established in
Appin, becoming himself security for making good any defi-
ciency that might happen.  For several years the office bare-
ly supported the expence of the runner, etc.; but the circu-
lation of correspondence increased so rapidly, that this last
year it made a cleat return to the revenue of about L. 74
Sterling, which would defray the whole coal duty of this
county yearly, as it stood lately, by a state from the
Customhouse books.  A runner goes now thrice every week
from Appin to Bunaw, and from Bunaw to Inverary, and re
turns as often.  A branch of this post-office extends from
Bunaw to Oban; and from Oban, where there is a Custom-
house, to Arofs in the Island of Mull.  Another branch ex-
tends from Appin to Fort William, the north line, and like-
wise to Strontian.  A letter may come in three days, or even
two days and a half, from Edinburgh to Appin.  The esta-
blishment of this post-office contributes highly to the plea-
sure and advantage of this country and the neighbourhood;
