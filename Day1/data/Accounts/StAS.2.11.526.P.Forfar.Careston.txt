	Not a few plants that properly belong to tbe upper coun-
try or Highlands are to be met with on the banks, or rather
low sides of Esk, being brought there in times of great floods,
when the river overflows its ordinary channel. Before con-
cluding the article of Botany, it may be stated that the Ge-
ranium pyrenaicum is said to be a sovereign remedy for the
disorder St Anthony's fire, it being used both outwardly and in-
wardly; and that Senecio vulgaris, mixed with Anthemis arvensis,
and boiled either in milk or in water, is then to be used as a
lotion for removing a dead lump: Also that an equal mix-
ture of Digitalis purpurea and Conium maculatum, boiled to the
consistency of a liniment, to which a proper quantity of hog's-lard
is to be added, is said to prove a good remedy for a cut, or even
an ulcer: Also, that a mixture of Chelidonium majus, with a very
little Hyosby`mus niger, and the root of the Polygonum avicu-
lare, boiled in a quart of water, along with the white's of a few
eggs, and a very little white vitriol, and then strained, may,
after being cooled, be beneficially applied to sore or weak eyes.
The Highlanders are said to use the Orobus tuberosus, under the
notion of averting the pain of hunger; also the root of the Inula
Helenium is said to be good for cows after calving.

there was a general belief in witchcraft.
