     of Bendothy.

Grampian mountains* on the N. W.; and by the Sidlaw+
and Ochil Hills on the S. E.; the breadth of the strath be-
tween being generally from 6 to 8 miles.

   River Isla.-The church stands 200 yards N. from the
right bank of the river Isla, part of the water of which
rises in the loch of Forfar, where is the highest ground of
the flat between this and Montrose, (about 200 feet above
the sea).  The course of the water from the loch of For-
far is through Dean, Isla, and part of Tay, in a line from
N. E. to. S. W. along the middle of Strathmore.  The Tay,
after a gradual winding to the left by Perth, runs by the
Carse of Gowrie and Dundee to the German Ocean, in
direction nearly parallel to the above portion of the tract
of the Isla inverted.  The Isla itself rises in the Gram-
pian mountains, and runs generally S. E. with a rapid cur-
rent till it is joined by the Dean, after which it runs S. W.
(past the south side of this parish) into the Tay.  At the
church of Bendothy the Isla is 75 yards broad, and a yard
deep at the ford.  It is no where deeper than 9 or 10 feet
in summer; and its banks are nearly the same height above
its ordinary surface.  At high floods, it rises 13 or 14 feet
above its summer level; this is in part owing to the Tay,
below this, being contracted for four miles by high and
narrow banks.  The Isla here is 100 or 110 feet above the
level of the sea.  It runs with an insensible fall.

* Grampian mountains are from 1000 to 4000 feet and upwards above
the level of the sea.  Originally and vulgarly called  (Great
Mountains).  See Boethius's Introduction or Preface, and Buchanan's
Index.

+Sidlaw, (Sud law, or South-hills), so called from their position with
respect to Strathmore.  They are about 1000 or 14000 feet above the level
of the sea.
