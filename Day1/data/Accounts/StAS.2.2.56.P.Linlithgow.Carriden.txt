annually resort to the shore of the Frith, for the benefit of bathing,
and of the sea air. It is difficult, except at high tides, to reach
a sufficient depth of water without wading to a considerable dis-
tance, and the footing in the soft yielding sleech is by no means
agrecable; besides, the water is not a little muddy, especially when
it is in any degree agitated: and, sometimes, considerable quan-
tities of peat moss in large coherent masses or in a pulpy state
are deposited on the shore, which has been floated down the river
in the process of clearing the extensive moss fields at Blair-Drum-
mond and other places in its vicinity.
   Meteorology.-The prevailing winds are from the south-west
and west. Next to these in frequency is the east wind. The se-
verest storms of snow are commonly from the east and north-east.
The following table gives the number of days in each month dur-
ing which the wind blew from any particular point of the compass
in 1834:
