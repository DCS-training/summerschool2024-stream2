     Parish of Tingwall.

     Statistical Account of the united Parishes of Tingwall,
     and Weisdale, 1797; by the Rev. James Sands, minister.

   Situation.-These united parishes are situated about the
centre of the Mainland, or principal island of Shetland. The
names, like all others in this country, are evidently of Nor-
wegian origin, though no satisfactory account can be given
of their etymology.  Taing, in the language of that country,
signifies 'a point of land stretching out into the water;' and
Tingwall or Taingwall, is said to derive its name from a small
island, in a water called the Loch of Tingwall, and joined to
the nearest shore by the remains of a stone wall. In this i-
sland, the courts of law are said to have been antiently held,
and to this day it is called the Law-Taing.  About two miles
west from Tingwall, and separated from it by a ridge of
mountains, extending from north to south about 6 miles, lies
Whiteness; and about two miles N. W. from Whiteness, lies
Weisdale.  The inhabitants of Weisdale had formerly their
own parish kirk; but in the year 1722 the kirk of Weisdale
was suppressed, the situation of the kirk of Whiteness alter-
ed, and a kirk built at Suretown in Whiteness, to be in all
time coming the kirk of Whiteness and Weisdale.
