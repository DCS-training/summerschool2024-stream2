   Church and Stipend.-The present church was built in 1654,
and is kept in good repair by the magistrates.  The old
church, stiled St John Baptist's, was converted by Oliver
Cromwel into an armory; for which he gave an allowance of
1000 English merks to build another.  It was in St John
Baptist's church that the parliament met to confirm Bruce's
title to the throne.  Records of their sederunt shew, that
numbers of the nobility could only sign their initials.  The
senior minister's living, including the glebe, is about L. 130
per annum.  The King is patron.  The town generally al-
lows the senior minister 12 guineas for a house.  The legal
stipend of his colleague would scarcely amount to L. 75; but,
from regard to him who at present fills the charge, the ma-
gistrates and council, besides allowance for a house, have add-
ed a sum which makes his stipend L. 105.  The town-coun-
cil and session are patrons.

     Miscellaneous Observations.-There are no volcanic appear-
ances in this parish, unless large rocks, and fragments of rocks, 
which have numerous indented stones, or metals of different
kinds, be considered as such.  Various figured stones and pe-
trifactions have been found in the parish.  There is a consi-
derable quantity of moor-stone lying on the surface of the
ground.  The free-stone lies rather deep.  Some houses in
the town let at L. 20, but a greater number between that
sum and L. 10.  The rent of the salmon fishery in the river
Doon is L. 80; that in the river Air a little less.  The Mar-
kets here are good.  The common fuel is coal.  The price
paid at the pit, per cart, is from 2 s. 3 d. to 2 s. 6 d.  The 
one pit is half a mile distant, and the other rather more.  That
at Drungan, in the parish of Stair, though a little dearer, is
undoubtedly the best.  According to tradition, there was a 
battle fought, before the Christian aera, in the valley of Dal-
