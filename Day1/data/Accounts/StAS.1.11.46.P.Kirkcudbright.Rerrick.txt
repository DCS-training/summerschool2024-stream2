dom.  It strikes into the land at right angles, about 2 miles
long and 1 broad: At low water an uninterrupted bed of
smooth sand, with not a rock to be seen; and so dry and firm,
that horse-races have been held on it.  Small craft may load
and unload in any part of it.  On the W. side is scooped out
by nature a capacious bason, where many vessels, of great
burden, may lie in safety from every storm.  At the head of
the bay there is a marsh, of about half a mile, formerly, to
all appearance, overflowed by the tide, but now under culti-
vation.  Off, at one corner, stands a gentleman's feat, with mo-
dern improvements; on the other, an ancient irregular vil-
lage.  Along the edges, there is a little rising ground, skirted
with natural wood; in the mouth of which, on a line with
the coast, is placed, exactly in the middle, a beautiful green
smooth island, called Heston.  It stands high out of the water,
and is pastured with sheep, and abounds with rabbits.

   Prospects.-As the high road leads across the head of this
bay, where the traveller has, on one hand, the wild heathy
prospect in the neighbourhood of Bencairn, and on the other,
this striking contrast, it exhibits a scene (especially while the
morning sun looks into it, having the lustre of its beams in-
creased by reflection from the water, at the same time that
their glare is corrected, by the woods and green fields that en-
viron it), so variegated, sweet, and soothing, that any person
of taste and sensibility must find a degree of reluctance in
parting with it.  From this to the farthest point on the S. W.,
the ground in general is considerably elevated; producing
what is commonly called a bold shore.  Here the prospect
rises from the simplicity of woods, creeks, and green fields,
and swells into the majestic and sublime.  If you take an in-
land view, you have an extent of about 50 miles, terminated
by Cairnsmoor, the hills of Carsphairn and Queensberry.
