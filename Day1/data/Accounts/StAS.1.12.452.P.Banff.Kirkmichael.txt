berries, two kinds of black berries, and two of red berries.
In the beginning of harvest, when these fruits are ripe, they
are sought for with avidity by the poorer children, to whom,
during the season of their maturity, they supply a portion of
food.  It is probable, that formerly, if at any time the la-
bours of the chase proved unsuccessful, even the men and
women of ancient Caledonia allayed their hunger by these
spontaneous productions of nature.  Dio Cassius expressly as-
serts, that our ancestors made use of a vegetable preparation,
by which they repressed, for a time, that importunate appe-
tite.  Caesar seems to allude to it in his description of the
Chara.  The soft inflected Chara of the Roman, evidently points
to the Cor of the Caledonians.  Cor signifies excellent, super-
ominent, a very expressive and appropriate name, if it sup-
plied the place of food.  It grows a little below the surface
of the ground, and spreads laterally into several ramifica-
tions, carrying larger or smaller knobs according to the soil,
and at irregular distances.  In spring it protrudes a small
greenish stalk, and in summer bears a beautiful flower, which
changing into pods, contains seed, when the root becomes in-
sipid and loses its virtue.  The country people, even at pre-
sent, are wont to steep it among water, where having conti-
nued for some days, it becomes a pleasant and nutritive
drink.  Till of late that the little wood of the kind has been
better preserved, the inhabitants used in the month of March
to extract a liquid from the birch, called* fion-na-uisg, a
bheatha, which they considered as very salubrious and condu-
cive to longevity.  By an easy metaphor, the name has been
transferred to denominate that well known spirit distilled
from malt; but a spirit of different effects in its consequence.

*The wine or water of the birch, or the water of life, in allusion to its sa-
lubrity.
