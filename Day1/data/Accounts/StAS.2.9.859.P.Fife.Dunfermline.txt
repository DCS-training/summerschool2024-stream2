sovereigns, with their retinue, might be accommodated with
lodgings at the same time, without inconvenience to one an-
other.
   Of its wealth we may form an idea, when it is mentioned, that
almost the whole of the lands in the western, and part of those
in the southern and eastern districts of Fife, various lands in
other counties, and at one time the barony of Musselburgh (then
denominated Musselburghshire), in Mid-Lothian, belonged to it.
This last place, however, was afterwards separated from it, and
converted into a distinct lordship, in favour of the Lord Chan-
cellor Thirlestane. The following are some of the remote places
from which its ample revenues were derived, conferred either by
Scottish sovereigns or opulent subjects, clerical or lay, at various
periods, from motives of gratitude or piety:-Kildun, near Ding-
wall, Buckhaven, Carnbee, Crail, Newburn, Kinglassie, Kirkcaldy,
Abbotshall, Kinghorn, Burntisland, named also Wester-Kinghorn,
Kinross, Orwell, Perth, Scone, Bendothy, Kirkmichael, Dun-
keld, Dellar, Tillicoultry, Clackmannan, Stirling, Logie, near
Stirling, Linlithgow, Cramond, Liberton, Maistertoun, in New-
bottle, Newton, Inveresk, Musselburgh, Tranent, Haddington,
Berwick, Coldingham, Roxburgh, Renfrew; besides the imme-
diately contiguous parishes, Inverkeithing, Beath, Saline, Cleish,
Carnock, Torryburn, and, of course, Dunfermline itself.
   Churches and Chapels of the Monastery.-The following is an
Alphabetical List of all the Churches and Chapels, the patronage
of which belonged to the Monastery of Dunfermline, along,
generally, with a right to the teinds and lands pertaining to them.
The names of the donors, too, and the dates of the donation, are
given, so far as these can be ascertained. Exact accuracy, how-
ever, as to these is unattainable, as the fact of the donation is
often mentioned only in a charter of confirmation, and there left
quite general :-
