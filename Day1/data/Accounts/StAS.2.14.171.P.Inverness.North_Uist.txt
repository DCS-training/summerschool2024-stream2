         Last summer some silver coins were found in a sand hillock;
      in the island of Boreray. They are various coins of James VI.
      and are in an excellent state of preservation.
         The greater number of the tacksmen occupy comfortable and
      commodious slated houses; and many of the farm-offices are of the
      same description. Besides there, the church, three mills, and three
      public houses are slated.
         The cottages occupied by the small tenants are, in general,
      annually-thatched, at a great sacrifice of time and labour.

                                III.-POPULATION.
                     The population in 1801 was 3010
                                       1811     3869
                                       1821     4971
                                       1831     4603

          The diminution has been caused By upwards of 600 souls hav-
       ing emigrated in the year 1828 to British America; and, though
       a few have since followed their friends across the Atlantic, the
       population is still excessive. It is now considerably greater than
       it was in 1831.  The census of that year we shall keep in view,
       in the following statements.

       <TABLE>

          The average of the various ages of the population is as follows

       strangled him.  From this circumstance he was called Paul na Hellidh or Paul of the
       Thong.  His life was short.  Revenge, which, in barbarous ages, takes a summary
       mode of inflicting punishment, soon overtook him.  In a few weeks thereafter, while
       Paul was building a stack of corn, from the top of it he observed, at some distance.
       a person of large stature rapidly moving towards the place.  He hastily asked those
       about him from what airt the wind had blown the day before.  On being informed
       it was from the east, and a leading wind from Skye, he exclaimed, the.person at a
       distance must be Angus, commonly called Aonas Fionn or Fair son of Donald Her-
       roch, who possessed some part of Troternish in Skye, and that it was time for him to
       look to his own safety.  At full speed, he fled to the church sanctuary at Kilmuir, a
       distance ofabout three miles.  Angus saw him at a distance, and, following him with
       still greater speed, just as he was crossing a small rivulet that bounded the sanc-
       tuary on the south side, bent his unerring bow, and the arrow pierced Paul in the
       heel.  He fell; his legs in the water and the rest of his body on the land within the
       sanctuary, which to this day is called Shead Phoil, or Pauls Field.  This field forms
       part of ihe grebe of this parish.  It is immediately adjoining the church; and the
       scene is pointed out about I00 yards from it.  A blind man, a Chromhalt of Donald
       Herroch, is said to have taken a brutal and indescribable revenge on Paul, which
       put an end to his lingering life.
          The memory of Paul na Hellidh is still beld in universal detestation, wbile the de-
       scendants of Donald Herroch have since his time possessed and still, possess large
       farms in North Uist.  Locbscolpeg, in which is, or rather was the dun, where Do-
       nald Herroch was so barously sacrificed to the evil passion of avardee, was some
       years ago drained by a gentleman living in its immediate neighbourhood; and on
       the side of the dun he has erected a small octagonal building.
