Buildings- The Hall of Claistran is a double house of modern
construction, at present occupied by a tenant. The principal
landed proprietors have neat comfortable dwellings and commo-
dious gardens, in which a good deal of taste is displayed. ' As the
farms are in general small the dwelling-houses correspond with
them, being built of stone and clay, and sometimes not plastered
on the inside, with the fire-place in the middle of the floor, or -to-
wards the inner end of the apartment, where the family usually sit,
with a stone, fence of from four to five feet high, and about the
'same breadth, on the inner side of which the fire is placed. In
'later times, some improvement in these erections has taken place.
