served oblivion; and to recover them by means of tradition,
were only to augument the already too numerous monuments
of the weakness and folly and crimes of mankind.  Their
magnitude and consequences, have perpetuated the memory
of 3 battles, which the statistical reader will expect in the
parish of St. Ninians.
   The battle of Stirling, was fought on the 13th September
1297.  The Scots were commanded by Wallace; the English
by Hugh Cressingham, and John Earl of Surry and Sussex.
The defeat of the English, effected near Corn-town, on the
northern banks of the Forth, was completed at the Torwood.
The boundaries of the Torwood are much contracted, and that
part of it which lay in this parish, is almost entirely removed.
   The battle of Bannockburn, was fought in this parish, on
Monday, the 24th June, 1314.  The English Reader may
find an account of this battle, in any British Historian.
The Antiquarian will not be displeased with the following
authentic description of Baston.
   Baston, a Carmelite friar, and prior of a monastery in
Scarborough, was reckoned one of the best poets of his age.
Edward brought him with the English army to Scotland, that
he might witness and celebrate the victory, which that mo-
narch expected to obtain.  The poet was taken prisoner, but
obtained his liberty, on condition of composing a poem in
honour of the victorious Scots.  Independently of the transac-
tion which it records, the poem itself is not the least of our
curiosities*.
