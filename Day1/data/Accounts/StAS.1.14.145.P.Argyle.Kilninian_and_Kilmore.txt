     Of Kilninian.

Island of Coll, returning next day.  The ferries from
this to the neighbouring parishes, are 2 to Morven, 1 to
Ardnamurchan, and 1 to the parish of Kilfinichen.  The
communication with Tiree, and other islands, is only by
occasional boats or vessels.

   Live Stock.-The live stock of the whole parish, as
nearly as can be conjectured, without numbering them,
may be about 3000 head of black cattle, of all ages;
400 horses, including mares and followers; 4500 sheep of
the South Country kind, besides a considerable number of
the smaller Highland kind.

   Population, &c.-According to Dr. Webster's report,
the population, in 1755, was 2590.  The total number
of souls, according to a list taken last winter, amounts to
3281.  Total number of baptisms, from January 1. 1792,
to January 1. 1793, was 96; of which 45 were boys, and
51 girls.  Total number of marriages in that period, 32:
But, according to the parochial register, the annual ave-
rage of baptisms is but 80, and of marriages 22*.

   Post offices, Sheriff Court.-There are 2 post offices in
this parish; 1 at Aros, and 1 in Tobermory.  The ar-
rivals and departures are 3 times a-week.  There is also
a sheriff-substitute court, lately established at Tobermo-
ry, for the regular administration of justice.  This must
turn greatly to the advantage of the island at large; as,

<FOOTNOTE>

*There is little doubt, however, that many baptisms of the parish have
not been entered upon the register, both because of the act imposing a tax
on entries of this kind, and because it is a practice with people, who live
at a distance from the parish minister, to apply occasionally to other cler-
gymen, for the benefit of that ordinance.  There is no account kept of
burials, bacause of the number, and great distances of the places of iuter-
ment.
