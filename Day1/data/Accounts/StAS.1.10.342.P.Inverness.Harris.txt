     NUMBER XXVIII.

     PARISH OF HARRIS.

     (Presbytery of Uist.-Synod and County of Inverness.)

     By the Reverend Mr JOHN MACLEOD.

     Name, Extent, etc.

   TILL of late, this parish has been designed Kilbride, from
one of the churches or cells in it so called.  It is now
denominated, in English, Harris, and, in the vernacular dia-
lect, Na Heradh, i. e. the Herries, plural; a name which seems
to be Gaelic, though we cannot pretend to trace its origin
with precision.  A fanciful etymologist might derive it from
na hardubh, signifying the heights; this parish being in reality
the highest and most mountainous part of the Long Island,
in which it is situated; and another circumstance, which seems
to give countenance to this derivation, is, that the highest
part of the Island of Rum, another of the Hebrides, is also
called Na Heradh.  Along the E. side of the parish runs the
Channel, which separates the Long Island from Sky and the
Continent.  Its W. coast is washed by the Great Atlantic
Ocean; and, on the southern extremity, it is bounded by the
parish of North Uist, from which It is separated by a narrow
Sound, running betwixt the island of Berneray and Uist, cal-
led Caolas Uist, i. e. the Sound of Uist.
