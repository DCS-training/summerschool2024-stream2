     NUMBER XV.

     OLD KILPATRICK,

     (COUNTY OF DUMBARTON.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN DAVIDSON.

     Minister of the Parish.

     Origin of the Name.

   KIRK or KIL-PATRICK takes its name from St Patrick,
the tutelar saint of Ireland, who, tradition says, was
a native of the parish.  There are many circumstances fa-
vouring this tradition; though Mr O'Halloran, an Irish
writer, supposes that he was rather a native of Wales.  In
a burying place in the church yard, there is a stone of
great antiquity, with a figure said to be that of St Patrick
upon it; and some go so far as to assert, that he was bu-
ried under it.  In the river Clyde, opposite to the church,
there is a large stone or rock, visible at low water, called
St Patrick's stone; and Pennant says, "Ireland will scarce
"forgive me if I am silent about the birth-place of its tu-
"telar saint.  He first drew breath at Kirkpatrick, and
"derived his name from his father, a noble Roman, (a
"Patrician), who sled hither in the time of persecution."
