pit now sinking are discovered, at the depth of 60 feet, the

   Coal.-This parish abounds with coal; and what a bent-
fit is it for Glasgow and its environs, to be so amply provided
with this necessary article?  There are computed to be a
greater number of colliers here, than in any other parish in
Scotland.
   1.  Fullarton coal-work, belonging to Mr Dunlop, is in
the western extremity of the parish.  The coal is opened to
128 yards depth, in which are 6 seams 23 feet thick, produ-
cing all the different kinds of coal that are found in Scotland,
and of excellent quality the splint is reckoned inferior to
no coal in Britain for a blast furnace.  A large stream engine
drains a field of 800 acres.  The coals are carried out of
the pit by a machine, in place of a horse-gin.-75 colliers
are employed, besides an equal number of artificers, labour-
ers, &c.  Wages are from 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s. 6 d. per day.  The
price at the pit is from 3 s. to 4 s. per ton.  From its near_
ness to Glasgow and Clyde, this work must greatly increase.
   2.  About a mile north of Fullarton, and 4 miles east of
Glasgow, lie Darrachnie and Sandyhills coal-works.  Though
these works are connected, it is to be observed, that near one
half of the winks and men are in the Barony parish.  The
seams of coals, wages, etc. are the same as at Fullarton.-90
colliers are engaged, besides about 60 bearers, boys, etc.
Here, last spring, Mr Hamilton erected a machine for draw-
ing up the coal, to go entirely by steam.-It is on an impro-
ved plan, and the first of the kind in Scotland.  It is found
to be the cheapest, and most expeditious way of doing that
business; for could colliers be placed in the pit to keep her
constantly employed, she would turn out about 200 ton per
day.  The present out-put is 35,000 tons per year.
