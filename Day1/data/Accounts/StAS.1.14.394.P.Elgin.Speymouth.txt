Mr. M'Intosh of M'Intosh, and Mr. Grant of Rothie-
murchus; and is floated down the river Spey in deals,
planks, logs, and spars.  The medium prices of the best
timber are as follows: Spar wood, from 16 to 24 feet
long, and from 5 to 8 inches square, at 7 d. to 8 d the solid
foot; logs, in the round form, 10 to 20 feet long, and 12
to 18 inches diameter, at 1 s. the solid foot; 3 inch plank,
12 feet long, and 10 inches broad, at 3 s. the piece; 2 inch
plank, 12 feet long, and 10 inches broad, at 2 s. the
piece; 1 1/4 inch deals, 12 feet long, and 8 inches broad,
at 1 s. the piece; 1 1/4 inch deals, 10 feet long, at 10 d.
the piece; scantling, cut to any dimensions the timber
will allow, at 1 s. and 1 s. 2 d. the solid foot.  The wood
is partly sold at Garmouth, to the people of the adja-
cent country; but the greater part is carried coastwise
by shipping.  There are several persons engaged in this
trade at Garmouth; but, for some years past, the greater
part of it has been carried on by an English Company.
Two capital wood merchants, Mr. Dodsworth of York,
and Mr. Osbourne of Hull, about 8 years ago, purchased
of the Duke of Gordon, the extensive forest of Glen-
more, in Strathspey, about 50 miles from the sea; and
since that time, they have carried on the trade with
great spirit.  They employ a great many hands, at the
forest of Glenmore, in selling the trees, and manufac-
turing them into plank, deals, masts, etc., and in pre-
paring the floats.  The plank, deals, and masts are sent
down the Spey in rafts, conducted by 2 men, at the rate
of 30 s. the raft.  The logs and spars are, for the most
part, floated down the river loose, to the number, per-
haps, of 20,000 pieces at a time, with men going along
the side of the river with long poles, to push them on,
as they stick on the banks.  There men have 1 s. 2 d.
