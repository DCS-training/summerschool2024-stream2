     of Lundie and Foulis.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The roads were formerly made
by statute labour, which is now commuted.  Turnpikes are
beginning to be erected; the people, in general, approve of
them; but some of the inferior ranks are not yet reconciled
to them.-The fuel generally used here is coals, at the rate of
3 L. per chalder.  Some peats are also used.-The principal
advantages of Lundie and Foulis are their vicinity to the Tay,
by which lime and coals are easily procured, and the extra
produce of the parishes exported.-The names of several of
the villages are derived from the Gaelic; e.g.  Balshando, the
old black town on the back of the hill; Lincrieff, a town on
the side of a hill, with trees, and the like: Others from their
situation; as Smistown, because mists lie long upon it, etc.-
The people, in general, are sober, regular, and industrious.
They enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the comforts of life, and
seem to be contented with their condition.
