     Statistical Account

   Encroachments.-It sometimes happens, that in the high
spring tides in the month of March and April, when there is
a storm, the sea forces itself through a sandy bay on the
south side, and spreads over a low plain, which is not above
3 feet above the level of the sea, and is as smooth as the fa-
mous plain of Runnamede, near Staines, and much resembles
it, except that it has not the same rising grounds around it.
If the sea disjoins this island, it must be here.  The re-
port already mentioned, of the largest bay in the island
having been once a wood, and that the shoal of Rennabreck,
was once a part of the isle of Sanday, is all that tradition
hands down, and assigns no period when it happened.  If
the sea gains so much on St. Mark at Venice; if the Good-
win Sands were once land; if the Roman fleet used to an-
chor on the coast of Italy, where cultivated lands now are,
we may readily believe, that the land and sea encroach on
each other, in an island like Sanday, so low on the east coast;
as it is observed that bays are more frequently formed on the
east coast, by reason of the earth's motion eastward, in con-
sequence of which the waters are protruded with more vio-
lence.

   Phenomena.-There are seldom any remarkable phenomena
in the air.  When the last fire happened at Bergen in Nor-
way, there was an unusual redness discovered in the horizon,
approaching to slame, about east by north from this island; and
afterwards it was found to have been precisely at the time the
fire was there.  Bergen lies east, or east by north from this
island.  In 1766, when there were great eruptions from Hecla
in Iceland, there appeared sometimes a small dust or ashes float-
ing in the air, which some imagined might have been from it.
