   The annual revenue of the university, derived from original pro-
perty, from parliamentary enactments, from royal grants, and from
the benefactions of individuals, amounted in 1825 to about L.3770.
In this sum was included the income of the bursars, amounting to
L,420.  Of the remainder, the principal part was made tip of the
royal grants, which then amounted to L.1435, and were given as
salaries to certain professors.
   A large portion of the college funds, amounting to L.13,119,
having been under the management of the town-council, and being
involved in the embarrassment of the city's affairs, the act of settle-
ment in 1838 provides an annual sum of L.2500 for the mainte-
nance and support of the college and schools of the city, in full of
all demands.
   The late General Reid bequeathed to the university the amount
of his property, which, after deduction of legacies and expenses,
is about L.62,000.  According to his directions a professorship of
music has been instituted, and an annual concert is given in
commemoration of his bequest.  The remainder of the funds is
to be applied to making additions to the library, or otherwise in
promoting the general interests and advantage of the university.
   From the year 1646 to 1703 several sums of money were mort-
gaged with the town-council by various individuals, for the purpose
of affording an annual sum to poor students attending the univer-
sity. A list of these and other bursaries to the university is sub-
joined.
