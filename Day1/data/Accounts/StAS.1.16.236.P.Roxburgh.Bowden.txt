<TABLE=Most of the inhabitants are either feuers, farmers, or cot-
tagers employed by them, except the after mentioned, viz.>

     14 Wrights,                     2 Shoemakers,
     3 Coopers,                      6 Grocers,
     1 Wheelwright,                  3 Blacksmiths,
     13 Tailors,                     1 Founder,
     11 Masons,                      2 Flaxdressers, and only
     12 Weavers,                     4 Alehouse-keepers.

</TABLE>

   About one third of the inhabitants are Burghers and
Antiburghers.  The latter have a meeting-house in the
parish; the congregation of which, from this and other pa-
rishes, pays their minister L. 60 per annum.  There are 4
corn-milts, each of which draws some multures; but that
servitude is beginning to be abolished.  A threshing machine
is newly erected, which does a great deal of work; but
when the prime cost, and interest thereon, tear and wear of
every kind, the number of hands, and the extraordinary
waste of horses, are all taken into the account, it may not
be of great profit to the proprietor.
