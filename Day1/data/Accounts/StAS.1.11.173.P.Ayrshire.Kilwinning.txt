young men in every parish were strictly commanded to prac-
tice archery, for an hour or two, every SUNDAY after divine
service.  After the invention of fire arms, archery was laid
aside, as no longer useful and necessary in war.  Though for
this reason it was disused in most other places in Scotland, it
has been practiced here, as an elegant and manly amusement,
almost without any interruption, to the present day.  At the
same time, the laws and usages of the Company, (the term
used for the Society), are known, and that too very imperfect-
ly, only by tradition, prior to the year 1488.  This date is
acknowledged and rendered authentic, by a minute in the re-
cords, dated September 1688.  This minute is signed by a num-
ber of gentlemen of the most respectable characters.  From this
time, archery has been practised annually, at a certain stated
time of the year, generally in the month of June.  What
has contributed, perhaps more than any thing, to its continu-
ance, has been the monastery.  This supposition is rendered
highly probable, from the species of archery in use here from
time immemorial.  It is of two kinds.  The one is a per-
pendicular mark, called a popingoe.  The popingoe is a bird
known in heraldry.  It is, on this occasion, cut out in wood,
fixed in the end of a pole, and placed 120 feet high, on the
steeple of the monastery.  The archer, who shoots down this
mark, is honoured with the title of Captain of the Popingoe.
He is master of the ceremonies of the succeeding year, sends
cards of invitation to the ladies, gives them a ball and supper,
and transmits his honours to posterity by a medal, with suit-
able devices, appended to a silver arrow.  The prize, from
1488 to 1688, was a sash, or, as it was called, a benn.  This
was a piece of taffeta or Persian, of different colours, chiefly red,
green, white and blue, and not less in value than 20 l. Scotch.
This honourable badge was worn by the captain, which he kept,
