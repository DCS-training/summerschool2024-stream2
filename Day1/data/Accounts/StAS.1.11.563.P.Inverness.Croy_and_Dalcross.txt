Knowledge, in the year 1759, with a list taken in the year
1774, the decrease, during that period, appears to have been
still greater: For in that report the number of examinable
persons was stated at                                   1560
which, adding the usual proportion of one 4th for
  children under 7 years of age,                         390
                                                        -----
  makes the total number, in 1759,                      1950
The number, in 1774, was only                           1425
                                                        ----- 
      Hence there appears a decrease of                  525

   By comparing the annual averages of births+, too, at dif-
ferent periods, the decrease appears equally conspicuous. The
average, for 5 years, from 1759 to 1763, inclusive,
  was                                          53
Ditto, from 1771 to 1775, inclusive, was       46          7
And, during the 5 last years, it is reduced to 41          5

which is nearly one fourth less within these 35 years. No
satisfactory reason can be assigned for this great and rapid
diminution of the population. It is attributed, in some mea-
sure, to the improvement and enlargement of several farms,
by which the number, both of occupiers and servants, has
been greatly reduced. Of late, some young men have been
in the practice of going to the South as labourers. But both
these causes conjoined, could not have produced the effect

<FOOTNOTE>

+It has not been the practice in this parish to keep a register of marriages
and deaths, and therefore no exact account can be given of them; but it is
supposed that the average of the former may be about 9, and of the latter
about 30.
