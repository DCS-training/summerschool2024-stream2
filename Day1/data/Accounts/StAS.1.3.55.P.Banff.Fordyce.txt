present beef sells from 2 1/2 d. to 4 d. the pound Amsterdam

pigeons at 2 d. the pair; turkies at 2 s. 6 d. and 3 s. each;
geese 2 s. 6 d. each.  Wheat at an average may be 17 s. 6 d.
the boll; something better than Linlithgow measure.  The
heritors convert barley rent at 14 s.  Oats may be reckoned
from 8 s. to 12 s. the boll; peace and beans equal to one boll
oat meal.  Farmers men-servants get from L 2:10 to
L. 6:6 annually.  Maid-servants from L. 2 to L. 2:10 an-
nually.  Day-labourers from 8 d. to 1 s. per day, without
meat, with meat 6 d. a day.  Mossing and harvest-work is the
dearest, and perhaps a little more than the above; for a
good harvest-man sometimes gets 1 s. and victuals, per day.
Thirty of forty years ago, men-servants got from L. 1:13:6
to L. 4 yearly; women-servants from 16 s. to 20 s.; day-
labourers from 5 d. to 6 d. without meat, with meat, about
4 d.  Master-masons now receive about 2 s. per day; master-
carpenters 1 s. 4 d. or 1 s. 6 d.; journeymen-masons from
1 s. 4 d. to 1 s. 6 d.; journeymen-wrights from 10 d. to 1 s.;
taylors get 6 d.; and victuals; house servants-maids from L. 2
to L. 3:3 yearly; men from L. 6 to L. 10 yearly.  With
the industry of his wife, a day-labourer may bring up his family.
As soon as they are able to work, the children are set to spin-
ning, or hired out to herd.  When old, if their children be
not both dutiful and successful, they need help from the
poor's-funds.  Their food is meal of oats, barley, pease,
and beans, with potatoes, milk, greens, and some fish, which
some years ago, when cheap, was a great help to their liv-
ing; but of late are rising above their purchase.  They sel-
dom can afford any flesh meat now, except at Christmas;
