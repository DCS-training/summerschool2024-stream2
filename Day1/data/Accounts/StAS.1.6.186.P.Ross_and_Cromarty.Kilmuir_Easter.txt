and the time of sowing it is from the middle of September to
the end of November:-rye, oats, and pease, from the begin-
ning of March to the middle of April; barley, flax, and pota-
toes, from the middle of April till the 20th of May; and tur-
nips from the 15th to the 25th of June.  The harvest general-

   Improvements.-It is computed that 300 acres of muir
ground in this parish have been brought into culture, within
the last 25 years; partly by mealers, encouraged by the pro-
prietors, and enticed to build huts on the muir, in the vicini-

sterling, laid out in trenching, building, fencing, etc. in the
course of 25 years, he has greatly beautified the face of the
country; and made Balnagown one of the most desirable seats
in the north.  Immense tracts of ground, at proper distances
from the house, are covered with very thriving plantations of
fir, or forest trees; most of which were planted by his imme-

the benefit.  Sir Charles Ross draws upwards of L. 200 an-

the house of Balnagown, towards the S. and near the shore,
lies New-Tarbat, the principal seat of the Earls of Cromarty:
this place, once the pride of Ross, both for situation and po-
licy, was, during the forfciture of that family, not only ne-
