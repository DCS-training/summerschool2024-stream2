ries, which are made use of for building houses and fences;
some of them yield stones well adapted for the purpose of
hewing.

   Animals.-Cattle and horses are in considerable num-
bers, 607 of the former, 130 of the latter.  No sheep, but
a few (about 40) kept principally for the use of gentle-
mens families*.  The farmers in the parish rarely follow
the plan of rearing cattle on their best farms; they rather
buy in and fatten.  Were they, however, to adopt the
plan of rearing, they have the means of so doing up to 36
and 80 stone weight, when the cattle have attained the age
of 4 or 5 years; and such cattle would bring, if fat, from
5 s. to 7 s. the stone, according to the demand and the
pitch to which they may happen to be fed.

   Population, etc.-According to the return made to Dr.
Webster in 1755, the number of fouls was then 616.  The
state of population cannot be traced far back with any de-
gree of exactness.  The taste for enlarging farms, and
razing cottages, has contributed not a little to diminish the
number of inhabitants in this and most country parishes in
Angus.  This diminution, however, is not so great as
might be expected from the number of houses demolish-
ed.  Farmers and others, keep more female sorvants than
are necessary, solely for the business of husbandry, and the
service of their families.  When not engaged in domestic
and farming business, they can find employment for them
in spinning yarn for the green linen manufacturers.  But

*We have no migratory birds, except green plovers, swallows, and
the cuckoo, which appear in the month of April; and the woodcock, in
the beginning of winter.  The swallow disappears about the month of
September, the cuckoo about the month of July.
