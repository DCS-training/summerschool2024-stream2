   Government make no provision for the disunion of unwieldy pa-
   rishes like this by an endowment, the evil will be prolonged, the
   advantage of it enjoyed alone where the teinds are unexhausted,
   and its benefits withheld from those destitute districts where thov-
   are most required.     If, on the contrac.,y, it embrace and make
   provision for parishes like this, where the population is scattered
   over a surface of wider extent than some of the lowland counties,
   then would the people of the Highlands hail the boon with rapture,
   as calculated to give them permanently those high and holy pri-
   vileges so long recognized as the birthright of the people of Scot-
   land, and the vital source of that 11 righteousness which exalteth
   a nation !"
