4 which led to Perth.  (Military Ways, p. 16.) One from
Aberdour and Newbigging, through the town of Kinross to
Perth.  A second, from the North Ferry, through the town
of Kinross to Perth.  A third, from the bridge of Stirling,
through the town of Dumblane, and the Roman camp at

which, together with the conveniency of the bridge, attract
a multitude of travellers.

in the year 1210, (Lib. 13. Fol. 288. first edition.)
   It would be tedious to quote the whole passage, which is a
