cessaries of life, they must watch the country people as they
come into town occasionally with the produce of their little
farms for sale; they must buy them at certain seasons, many
months before they are needed; or they must hire people at
a considerable expence to go through the islands to purchase
them.  People thus employed, either on their own account,
or on that of others, have been known in winter, when the
weather is bad, and the seas stormy, to have been detained
five or six weeks from their labour and their families.
These, and many other evils of a similar nature, which arise
from their having no regular markets, call aloud for a reme-
dy, and should certainly as soon as possible be listened to by
those whose duty it is to apply it.  But the attachment to
old established customs which so generally prevails here, is
the parent of many of the inconveniences the people labour
under, and were this once weakened or destroyed, they
might soon be in a better condition.

   Flax might be raised here, as the soil is by no means unfit
for it; and had the people once acquired skill sufficient to
sow, to weed, and to water it, they might find a very useful
employment in dressing it, when they are now almost idle
during the winter.  To spin it would employ a number of
females-to weave it into cloth would give bread to weavers;
and a manufacture thus carried on from a raw material rear-

rise from a due attention to the wool, which is certainly of
an excellent quality.  Did the farmers take that care of their
sheep which their importance merits; did they employ-
ful hands to sort and to dress the fine soft wool which they
bear; and were there people of knowledge in that particular
business to manufacture it, the people of Orkney might, in a
