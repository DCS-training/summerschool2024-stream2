          in 1790, there were not above 1600 examinable persons in the pa-
          rish. The chief cause of this great decrease in the space of six-
          teen years was, that, in 1782, many were reduced to poverty by
          the loss of their cattle, and the almost total failure of the crop of
          that year, which occasioned such accumulated distress, that they
          were obliged to remove with their families, and settle in the low
          country as day-labourers or domestic servants.

             The population of the parish since the last census has increased
          to 2000.
             No nobility reside within the bounds of this parish, but many
          resort thither during the shooting season, and remain for two or
          three months. There are several respectable farmers, with good
          habitable houses and commodious squares; and also two gentle-
          men who are large sheep-farmers, viz. Donald Macleod, Esq.
          Gladefield House, and Ebenezer Mackay, Esq. Invercarron,
          House, who farms the estate of Invercarron, (the proprietor being
          in India.)
             As a proof of the healthiness of the climate, it may be men-
          tioned, that there is at present residing at Culrain, in this parish,
          an old pensioner of the name of Donald Ross, who entered the
          21st, or Royal North British Regiment of Fusileers, in the year
          1760, during the reign of King George II., being then twenty
          years of age. Though he completed his hundredth year last
          spring, this hoary veteran still enjoys pretty good health.
             There are 2 insane, (1 occasionally); 2 fatuous, and also deaf
          and dumb, (a brother and sister); 1 blind, (a woman); and 2 deaf
          and dumb, (brothers.)
             Language.-The language generally spoken and understood is
          the Gaelic; and though most of the rising generation understands
          English also, yet the Gaelic can scarcely be said to have lost
          ground within the last forty years; as a proof of which, it may be
          mentioned, that, during the summer months, while the day is long,

          <FOOTNOTE>The decrease in the population in 1811 was accounted for by the system which
          had been adopted, some time before, by proprietors, of turning several small farms
          into one, and depopulating whole straths for the purpose of raising sheep.
