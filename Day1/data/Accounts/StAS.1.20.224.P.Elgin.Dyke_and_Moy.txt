   Antiquities.-At Darnaway, the feat of the Earls of Mo-
ray, of the Randolph, Dunbar, Douglas, and Stewart race,
stands an old castle, nobly elevated, with great range and
variety of prospect, which has been built at different pe-
riods, adjoining to a princely hall, that had been erected by 
Thomas Randolph, Regent of Scotland, during the mino-
rity of King David Bruce, for the reception of his nume-
rous vassals.  This hall is by much the oldest and most re-
markable part of buildings, which are now altogether a
venerable pile.  After all the changes it has undergone, it 
is still a pleasing monument of ancient hospitality and mag-
nificence.  The length is 89 feet, and breadth 35.  It has
yet from 18 to 20 feet of side wall, though it wants about
12 of its original height, by reason of a range of vaults con-
structed on its ground-floor, for cellars, with a stone pave-
ment above them.  It has a battery in the outer end, and
above that a music gallery, from side to side.  There was a
large chimney in the opposite end, and another spacious
fire-place in one of its sides.
   The roof is supported by diagonal couples and rafters of
massy oak, more superb than any modern ceiling, and re-
sembles that of the Parliament House of Edinburgh, and
Guildhall of London.  Earl Randolph's hospitable board, of
thick oaken plank, curiously bordered and indented, stand-
ing on 6 pillars, draws out at one end to double length.
His oaken chair, on which are coarsely carved the bearings
of his office and arms, weighs about 60 libs. avoirdupois,
and differs little from the coronation chair in Westminster
Abbey.

   Coins.-In digging the foundation of the new church, be-
hind the old one, a day-labourer found a deposit, as he was
working alone, before the arrival of his companions, and, co-
vering it up, contrived to employ himself and the others,
