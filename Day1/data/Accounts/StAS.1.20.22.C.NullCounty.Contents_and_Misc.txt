<FOOTNOTE>

*It is of peculiar importance to have the questions 48 and 49 distinctly
answered, for it is generally understood, at least on the Continent, that the
population of any district or country, may be known with sufficient accura-
cy, by multiplying the number of births by 26, or the number of deaths
by 36.  In Scotland, on the other hand, Mr Wilkie, minister of Cults,
supposes, that the number either of births and burials, if they are equal,
should be multiplied by 40; or, if there is any difference, the half of the
whole, (both the births and the burials), should be multiplied by the ex-
pectation of an infant's life, adapted to the particular district, in order to
ascertain its population.  See Statistical Account, vol. II p 415.  It ap-
pears, from Mr Wilkie's calculations, that the expectation of a life in
Scotland, is much greater than in England, or on the Continent.
