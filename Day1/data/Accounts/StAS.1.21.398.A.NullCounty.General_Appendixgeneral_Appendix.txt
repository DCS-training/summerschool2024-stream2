   General Observations on Glebes.-I.  The original idea of as-
signing glebes to the Clergy, seems to have been "to sup-
"ply them, through this means, with conveniencies suited
"to their situation; that they might be enabled, without
"unnecessary distraction, to attend to such ministerial oc-

as to seem rather designedly to have been contrived to create
embarrassment.
   It cannot surely be supposed to have been the intention
of the Legislature, that the clergyman, with his one horse

his one horse should, singly, draw the plough.  If, however,
he hires a man-servant, who can dig, plough, sow, mow
grass, build stacks, and in short do every thing that may
occur in the farming of the glebe; this servant, so complete
in his kind, must be kept at an enormous expence in pro-
