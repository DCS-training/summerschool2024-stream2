<FOOTNOTE>While the great importance of accurate Parochial registers is admitted by all, it
is astonishing how little they have been attended to in this country. In Edinburgh,
the metropolis of Scotland, a city distinguished for its erudition, and for its nume-
zous and valuable institutions, the baptismal register is miserably defective. It ap-
pears from printed report of a Committee of the Town-Council of that city, of date,
20th February, that in 1834, the baptismal register for the thirteen parishes
contained only the names of four hundred and eighty children.
