labouring as formerly.  The muir land is kept for pastu-
rage.

   Prices of Provisions and Labour.-Provisions are high
priced.  Butcher meat is often sold at a dearer rate than in
Edinburgh; butter at 10 d. per lib. (24 oz.) a pair of fowls
at 1 s. 8 d. formerly only 1 s.; cheese 6 d. per lib. formerly
3 1/2 d.; and other articles in proportion.  The manner
living is greatly changed, being much more expensive; yet
the farmers are in better circumstances, and much better
lodged than they were 30 years ago.  The wages of a man
servant are from 6 L. to 8 L. Sterling; and those of a maid
servant from 3 L. 4 s. to 3 L. 15 s. per annum.  A day-labourer
gets 10 d. with his meat, or 1 s. 4 d. without it; a taylor,
8 d. with, or 1 s. without it; a wright, 1 s 6 d.; a mason,
1 s. 6 d.; a man for weeding potatoes or turnips, 8 d.  In
harvest, a man gets 1 s. 4 d. a woman, 1 s. 2 d. For 20
years past, work of every kind has risen in expence one third.
It is more than probable the rise will still he higher.  The
school fees alone are moderate.  Some farmers have their
corns threshed for 4 d. per boll, with maintainance; a ditch
3 feet deep dug, with the thorns set, at 8 d. per rood, and a
double ditch at 1 s. 4 d.

   Roads, Fuel, Diseases, etc.-The roads are in a bad state,
but will be put in good repair, as money for the statute la-
hour is to be exacted, as far as law allows.  One great incon-
venience the people labours under, is the distance from coals,
which is not less than 30 and 32 miles.  Some peats may be
procured here, but so high priced, that coals at 15 s. the 12

whole, 15 s. to the second, and 10 s. to the third.  The plough-
men would thus be attentive from first to last, and justice would
be done the master.
