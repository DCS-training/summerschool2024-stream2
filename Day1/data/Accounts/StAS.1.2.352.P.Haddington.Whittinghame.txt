country, and are driven by the winds, till they are intercepted
by the neighbouring hills; by which, they are broken and for-
ced to descend in rain.  This circumstance renders the cli-
mate of East Lothian, one of the driest, most pleasant, and
delightful in Scotland.-  It is not remembered, that this parish
has been ever visited with any epidemical distemper; and in-
stances might be given of great longevity.

   Arable Land, and Crops.-  There are 56 ploughgates in the
parish; each ploughgate containing about 50 acres of arable
land.  The crops, commonly raised, are wheat, barely, oats,
pease and beans, turnips, and sown grass; and the most in-
telligent farmers generally take white and green crops al-
ternately.  This method of cropping has a surprising effect, in
cleaning, enriching, and meliorating the soil.  Turnips and
grass crops, are certainly among the greatest and most valuable
improvements, which have been made in agriculture.  As a
proof of the slowness, with which useful discoveries are extend-
ed, it may be observed, that it is only of late that the utility
of these crops was universally known, even in East Lothian.
It is only about 20 years ago, that turnips were generally
introduced through the country.  A trifling quantity of clover
and rye-grass seeds might be sown, upwards of 50 years ago;
but it will not exceed 37 years, since it became the univer-
sal practice among farmers to adopt this species of husban-
dry

   Markets and Roads.-  The situation of the parish, for
disposing of its several productions, is extremely convenient.
Wheat, barley, oats, pease, and beans, are carried, every
Friday, to Hadington market, at the distance of from 3 to 6
miles.-The public roads, leading hither, are kept in excel-
lent repair.  L. 56 are annually laid out for that purpose,
