by a channel or sound, nearly 8 or 9 miles broad, which 
never ebbs; towards the W. and N. W. it is bounded by 
the great Atlantic ocean, and to the eastward and south- 
ward, it is separated from the island of Sky by a channel, 
perhaps 18 or 20 miles broad.  The parish is long, from 
N. E. to S. W. 30 computed miles, and its greatest 
breadth may be estimated from 7 to 9 miles. 

   Soil, Surface, Climate, etc.-Towards the west side of
the parish, the soil is totally light, and perfectly sandy, 
and the most part of it rendered quite useless, by the se-
verity of the constant storms, that blow from the W. with 
the force of the sea, during the winter and spring seasons; 
further back, there is one continued chain of swamp and 
lakes; abounding with the greatest variety of the finest
trouts; and still to the eastward, there are high and lofty 
mountains, covered with heath and verdure, fit enough 
for pasturing black cattle, horses, sheep, and goats, during 
the summer and autumn months.  The well known har-

Lochunort, and Lochboisdale, are so accurately and clearly
laid down by Mr Murdoch Mackenzie, the surveyor, in 
his draughts of this coast, that it is quite unnecessary to 
mention them here.  As the soil to the west side of the 
parish is for the most part light and sandy, it of course 
must be barren of itself, without the force of manure.
There are delightful fields to be seen covered with the 
finest natural grass in summer; yet, in the winter season, 
many of these very spots are covered over with drifted 
sand in such a manner, that the least trace of verdure can- 
not be seen for many months.  Were it not for the im-
mense quantity of floating sea-were that is thrown a-shore 
during the winter-storms, the inhabitants never could ma-
