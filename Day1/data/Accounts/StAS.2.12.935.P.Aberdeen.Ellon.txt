seminaries constituted on such a principle of exclusion, which hap-
pily, however, are not yet to be found in this part of the empire, it
may be sufficient to remark, that, as the basis on which they are
established affords the surest indication of the actual prevalence
of the evils which it is the proper business of education to coun-
teract and extirpate, so the only result that can be reasonably an-
ticipated from them is the farther development of such evils in
an aggravated form.
   But, omitting all notice of seminaries, of a constitution so ut-
terly preposterous, there is reason to apprehend, as has been al-
ready hinted, that in schools of a better character, and even in
our parochial schools themselves, religious instruction is not inter-
woven in such a manner with the whole business of education, as
an enlightened regard to the establishment and confirmation of
sound principles of religion in the minds of the pupils seems ob-
viously to require.  It is believed, that in all our schools, without
exception, the course of instruction pursued, is, in respect of this
important matter, disjointed and fragmentary.  Religion, indeed,
in the schools more immediately under notice, is not an excluded
branch of knowledge nor in such schools is the place assigned to
religious instruction, strictly so called, that is, to the exposition of
the daily scriptural lesson, less prominent than, from the multifa-
rious subjects to which a parochial schoolmaster must give his at-
tention, it might be expected to be.  The true ground of complaint
is, that it occupies, amidst the general business of the day, an iso-
lated position; that it blends not its sacred truths with the system
of education considered as a whole; in short, that there is not
stamped upon the entire course of instruction followed the genu-
ine impress of a religious character.  The remark that religion
holds, in modern systems of education an isolated place, is to be
taken, of course, with greater or less latitude, according to circum-
stances.  Perhaps few school-books are to be met with, in which
there may not be found occasional pieces, conceived in a scriptu-
ral spirit, and calculated to impress the reader with sound views
of scriptural truth.  But it is believed that the number of such
works is still more limited, in the compilation or composition of
which, particularly with regard to those of them intended for
the use of more advanced pupils, the hand of an enlightened
Christian philosophy has been steadily at work, in culling from the
fields of science, history, literature, &c. such views of God, of na
ture, and of our common humanity, as, breathing the genuine spi-
