ever, for children resident in that quarter to travel three or four
miles to school.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The average number of persons re-
ceiving parochial aid averages rather under 50; average sum allot-
ted to each weekly 1s. 4d. The fund from which the disbursement
is made arises from church collections, which in 1836, was L.55,
11s.; in 1837, L.55, 17s.; in 1838, L.56, 4s. 3d.; in 1839,
L.53, 9s.; in 1840, L,46, 10s; in 1841, L.46 16s.; and from
a voluntary assessment of L.168, in 1841, paid by Mr Murray of
Broughton; but these assessments necessarily vary from year to
year. Poor's rates, in the direct sense of the term, are unknown
here.
	Savings Bank.--There is a savings bank in the parish, under the
auspices of Mr Kirkpatrick. The amount invested is about sta-
tionary at L. 1200. There are various friendly societies.
	Prison.--There has, for some years, been a lock-up-house at
Gatehouse, meant to be used in cases of petty crimes or offences;
but it is seldom necessary to have recourse to it.
	Fuel.--At one time, peat was the chief fuel used; but, except
in the middle and higher portions of the parish coals, got from
Whitehaven and Workington, have been all but universally pre-
ferred within the last thirty or forty years. The price of coals
may be about 15s. per ton of 20 cwt.

			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	The state of the parish has varied, and, in most instances, has
been signally improved, since the former Statistical Account was
written in 1792. There have been a new church and manse built,
--the former at Gatehouse, the latter in the vicinity both in the
best situations, in the very centre of the great bulk of the popula-
tion of the parish. The income of the minister, including stipend,
manse, and glebe, was then estimated at L. 120; it is now about
L.200. The weekly church collections were then L.25 per an-
num; they are now upwards of twice that amount. There was
then only one school in the parish; there are now five. The po-
pulation has increased 509, or from 1363 to 1872. The only
turnpike road in the parish was rude and almost impracticable,
running nearly in a straight line over successive hills, some of them
fully 300 feet above the level of the sea. A new turnpike road
was constructed about forty years ago, which is one of the best in
the kingdom, approaching nearly to a level. A similar improve-
ment has been effected along the whole line of road from Dum-
