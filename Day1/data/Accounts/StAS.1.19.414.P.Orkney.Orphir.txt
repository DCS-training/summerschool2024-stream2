     Statistical Account

To Lord Dundas, who is the present superior, and who is
justly esteemed to be one of the best gentleman in England,
no blame whatever can attach; his family purchased the
estate long after the date of those grievances; and, so far
from meriting the flightest charge of oppression, his Lord-
ship, in a year of uncommon scarcity, upon receiving a list
of those grievances, readily offered to accept of the lowest
conversion the proprietors would name, provided the same
benefit were communicated to their subtenants:  And, fy
be on the man who rejected the equitable and humane
proposal.
   On the Orkney weight, called the punlar, 24 merks
make 1 setting = 32 Lb. Dutch, and 6 settings make
1 miel=11 1/2 stone ditto.  This instrument is upon the same
principle as the Roman steelyard, but may be very easily
falsified; for by making the smallest alteration on the
short arm, to which the weight is appended, the receipt
may be considerably increased or diminished; and either
the payer or receiver greatly injured.  A mistaken notion,
however, prevails in this county:  That, supposing this in-
strument to be correctly adjusted, and that the weigher were
an honest person, yet still this mode of payment is in favour
of the receiver.  But the cafe is quite the reverse; for after
an exact survey of the punlar, upon mechanical principles, it
will be sound, that for every stone weight above two, the
receiver sustains a loss of 2 2/3 Lb. Dutch.  To make this un-
derstood, it will be necessary to explain, that the punlar is a
lever of 6 feet long, divided, by notches, into 12 equal parts,
of 6 inches each, one of which constitutes the short arm,
from the extreme end of which projects a plug of iron, of a
little more than an inch long, and at the end thereof is in-
serted a pivot, round which a hook moves, for holding up
the weight.  The balance, upon the opposite arm, is a stone
of 32 Lb.  Dutch, appending from a moveable ring, which
