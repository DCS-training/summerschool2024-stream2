blackened and hardened as if it had been subjected to a consider-
able heat. At Bogend the lowest members of the coal forma-
tion have evidently been upheaved by the lava-like protrusion
of the trap, which brings, the Millstone-grit and its accompanying
bed of coal to the surface. The minerals below the trap at the
Kirk of Shotts are as follows:

	The most interesting portion of the parish, in reference to its
mineralogy, lies to the south of the Glasgow and Edinburgh road,
and comprehends some of the most valuable carboniferous de-
posits in this valuable mineral section of Scotland. The coals
have been chiefly wrought here. The principal seams wrought
are the Lady Anne, or splint coal, the, Shotts Ironworks first
and second coals, the Smithy coal, and the parrot or cannel
coal. The relative positions in, which these coals stand to
each other are as follows: From Lady Anne coal to Shotts Iron-
works first coal, 40 fathoms; to Shotts Ironworks second coal,
6 fathoms; to Shotts Smithy coal, 9 fathoms; to parrot coal, 4
fathoms. The coal which ought to be found above these are
the Ell, Pyotshaw and Main coal. As the Monklands have now
become the Rome and Athens of our coal districts, there seems
to be a propriety in adopting, as far as possible, their mineral phra-
seology. We therefore give the same seams, though, designated
by different names, as follows:
