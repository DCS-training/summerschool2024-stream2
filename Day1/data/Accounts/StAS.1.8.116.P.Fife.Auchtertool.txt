There is one threshing machine lately erected.-The stile of
farming is, in general, carried on after the new plan of hus-
bandry, and is much improved of late years.  This seems
chiefly owing to the introduction of sown grass, cabbage and
turnips.  The former serves to give rest and solidity to the
soil, and prepares it for the production of future crops; the
latter cleanses and pulverises it, and opens it to receive the
influences of the fun and air, the great quickeners and softer-
ers of vegetation.  The hay, thus raised, is sold, at an ave-

farmer.  Cattle are brought into the house, some time be-

paring it for the turnips and cabbage, together with the weed-
ing and hoeing which are afterwards given it, and independ-
ent of what profit is to be made of the cattle, which are some-
times bought cheap, and sold dear, gives, moreover, a great
command of dung to enrich the rest of the land; a circum-

   The land is generally plowed with a horses; except where
it is wet or steep, when 3 are used.  But there is a division
of opinion as to the use of the new and the old plough; some
