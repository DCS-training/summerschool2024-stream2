     of Lanark.

was built from the munificence of the late William
Smellie, M.D. well known from his publications on
the obstetric art, who bequeathed L. 200 towards re-
building the school-house, and also left to it his library
of books, which are kept in the room immediately above
the school-room.
   Manufactures.  There is a considerable manufactory of
stockings here, between 75 and 80 stocking frames, being
constantly employed.  The workmen's wages in all are a-
bout L. 35 weekly.  This business has increased considera-
bly within these 7 or 8 years.  About 20 years ago, there
were no more than 5 or 6 frames in the town.
   Previous to the American War, a very great quantity
of shoes was manufactured here for exportation, and sent
to Glasgow weekly, but since that period the demand is
considerably decreased.

   Fairs.  There are at Lanark 7 fairs in the year, all of
them well frequented.  Lammas fair is an excellent market
for lambs and young colts.  This fair some time ago sup-
plied the Highlands with lambs and sheep; but of late the
demand from that country is considerably lessened.  Mar-
tinmas fair is a good market for black cattle, lint, yarn, and
coarse linnen.

   History.  About anno 978, Buchanan informs us that
Kenneth II. held an assembly, or parliament, being the
first mentioned in history, at Lanark; a circumstance about
which Fordun, our oldest author now extant, is silent.
   Anno 1244, Fordun tells us that Lanark among some
other towns was burnt to the ground, but does not men-
tion the circumstances.
