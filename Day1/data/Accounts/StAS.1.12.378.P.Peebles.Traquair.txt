   Antiquities and Natural Curiosities.-The bush aboon Tra-
quair, which in former times might be a considerable thicket
of birch-trees, the indigenes of the foil, is now reduced to 5
lonely trees, which solitarily point out the spot, where love,
and its attendant poetry, once probably had their origin.
Part of the house of Traquair is of very remote antiquity,
was built on the bank of the Tweed, easily defensible from
that side, and might possibly, in the days of hostility, be pro-
perly guarded on the other.  It was in the form of a tower. 
There have been several other tower houses in the parish, one
or which is still almost entire at Cardrona.  The tradition
of the country is, that there was a continued chain of these
houses so situated on both sides of the Tweed, as by lights

denominated Chesters, where there are evident marks still
remaining of lines of circumvallation, mostly circular in their
form, which seem rather places intended for a security to
their cattle against sudden incursions, than regular encamp-
ments.  Tradition dignifies them by the denomination of Ro-
man camps.  They are all constructed upon the top of emin-
ences not easily affailable, and every particular district has its
own.  Their frequency is perhaps the best indication of their
use.  Glendean's banks are remarkable for their extent and
precipitous elevation.  They are more than half a mile in
length, and from 200 to 300 feet in height, and are truly a
tremendous chasm, as denominated by a certain author.

   Names of Places.-Kailie, Cardrona, Glen, Fethen, Glen-
lude, Fingland, Teniel, Bold, and Quair, are probably de-
rived from a Celtic origin.  Grieston, Know, and Scrogbank,
etc. are not of so remote derivation.  Grieston abounds with
slates, and has given origin to the name, expressive of the
