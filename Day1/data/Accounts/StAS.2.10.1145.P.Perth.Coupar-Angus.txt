     The cultivatdd lands in the parish may be classed under the
  different varieties of soil in nearly the following proportions :

<TABLE>

  Under a low-lying clayey soil, too stiff for profitable cultivation of the
    different species of green crops,                                  Acres 100
  Under a deep soil, chiefly of alluvial formation, rather stiff, but natu-
    rally fertile,                                                           300
  Under a free soil of moderate depth, and of every degree of fertility
    from the useful sands to a medium loam,                                 1300
  Under a gravelly soil,                                                      70
  Under the inferior dry sands,                                              420
  Under a soil of medium quality, resting upon a close subsoil,              290
  Under poor sandy clays and low-lying wet sands,                            230
  Under peaty soil,                                                           50

    The unoccupied land consists of

  Very inferior wet sands about                                               30
  Poor gravelly soil,                                                          5

     There are, besides, several patches of useful pasturage along the
  old course of the Isla.
     About 80 acres are under wood.
     The average rent of land is about L.2, 3s.; and the general
  duration of leases nineteen years.
     The general system of cropping is by a rotation of four years.
  This system is more generally adopted than is consistent either
  with the nature of the soil or the practice of good husbandry.  A
  large proportion of the arable laud consists, as has been stated, of
  a dry fine soil, and is peculiarly adapted to the cultivation of tur-
  nips and the artificial grasses.  Such a soil would require a rota-
  tion, embracing in its course a period of rest in pasture suitable
  to the nature of the land, and to the state of its fertility.  The
  number of small farms may, to a certain extent, account for the
  general adoption of the system usually followed.  The amount of
  capital laid out in stock and implements of husbandry being
  greater, when the farms are small, than what is required for the
  cultivation of the same amount of land when divided into large
  farms, holds out an inducement to the proprietors to impose as
  little restraint on the mode of cultivation as is consistent with the
  ordinary rules of good husbandry.  The rotation of four years,
