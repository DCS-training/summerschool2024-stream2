with the charitable aid of their neighbours, removes the
necessity of their becoming vagrants, and makes them live
pretty comfortably.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people are remarkably
sober and humane, and very diligent in their callings.
There is but 1 licensed public house, and but little fre-
quented, except by travellers.  The industry of those in the
farming line here, as in most places, is not always attend-
ed with that success which might be wished.  Seasons and
circumstances, for some years, have been much against
them.  Since 1782 the harvests have been very late and
precarious.  The price of meal (which, at an average, may
be valued at 12 s. the boll) bears no proportion to the
price of every article the farmer has to buy.  But what is
most complained of at present, is the extravagant wages of
their servants, which, for some years, have advanced at the
rate of 10 s. the year*.  For there reasons, the condition of
mechanics and subtenants (who depend more upon their
trade than the produce of the ground, and do not require
servants) is preferable to that of farmers.  The condition of
the farmers, as well as of the farms, might be meliorated by
longer leases; and by converting, at a moderate rate, that
part of their rent which is paid in kind into money.  This
would leave the farmer at more liberty to prosecute that
mode of farming which he found most successful; whereas,
when a large proportion of his rent is paid in meal, he is
