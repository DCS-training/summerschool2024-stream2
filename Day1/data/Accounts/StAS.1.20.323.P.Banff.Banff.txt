" Lord the King and Queen, their predecessors and succes-
" sors; for all Christiane soules; for the theiking of the
" kirk with sclate, and the bigging of the tolbuthe, and for
" quhat the burgh has not substance."  Similar leafes were
probably granted until the year 1581, when George Ogil-
vie of Dunlugas, provost, and his coadjutors in office, resol-
ved to feu to perpetuity.  To this effect they obtained a
charter from James II. of Scotland, dated May 9, 1581.
The preamble bears, that "for the advantage of the burgh*,
" the council had been in use of granting leases of their
" property to the residing burgesses; that these leases were
" now expired, and that the nobility in the neighbourhood
" seeing the same, and hoping to acquire the profits, did
" trouble and molest the peace of the town, and gave no
" rest to the people:  therefore," etc. etc.
   This charter was renewed on the King's attaining the
age of 25 years, mutatis mutandis.
   Having thus obtained a right to let out their property to
perpetuity, the guardians proceeded to exercise their powers.
John Baird, provost, and the bailies of the town, (two of
whom could not write), were among the commissioners ap-
pointed ad bunc effectum.  According, A. D. 1595, " be-
" cause of the warres and troubles, the darth of the coun-
" try, and scantiness of victual, with exorbitant stents and
" taxations for supporting the warres, the public warkes, and
" uphading of the kirk, tolbuthe, and calfies, etc.; for re-
" meid whereof, this empower to set, sell and feu, the com-
" mon land and salmon-fishings of the burgh, to merchant-
" burghers, and actual residenters."
   These magistrates and commissioners, in consequence of
their instructions, did accordingly let out to perpetuity, for
a small annual feu-duty, the greater part of their lands, and
the whole of their salmon-fishings.
