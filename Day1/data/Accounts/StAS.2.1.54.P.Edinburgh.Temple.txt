ling.* At the same period Mr John Douglas was reader at Clerk-
ington, and had of stipend L. 16, 17s. 9d., or L. 1, 8s. 1 5/4 d. Sterling,
with the kirk land, paid out of the third of Corstorphin or kirk of
Clerkington.+ From that period, the cure of the parish de-
volved on Mr George Haistie, from 1590 to 1594; Mr James
Haistie, 1595 to 1608; Mr Thomas Copland, 1620 to 1631;
Mr Robert Couper, 1632 to 1655; Mr Robert Mowat, 1656 to
1662, when he was thrown out for non-conformity: he was restor-
ed (by act of Parliament) 1690, but does not appear to have again
discharged the duty, though he survived till 1692; Mr Robert
Spottiswood, 1663 to 1676; Mr Patrick Trent, 1676 to 1681,
when he was deprived on account of not taking the test, and was
obliged to give place to the old Presbyterian incumbent: Mr
Alexander Burgess, 1682 to 1690, according to the act of Par-
liament; Mr David Walker, 1690 to 1737; he previously offi-
ciated in the meeting-house at Nicolson, in the parish, after the
toleration granted by King James VII.; he then became the
colleague of Mr Mowat: Mr Archibald Walker, 1738 to 1760;
Mr Joseph M'Cormack, 1760 to 1770; Mr John Goldie from
1771 to 1788; Mr James Goldie, 1789. In 1590, Clerkington
with Mont Lothian (now annexed to the parish of Penicuik) and
Morphet formed another parochial cure served by Mr James
Haistie, minister.
   The church is situated nearly in the north-east corner of the
parish, and is distant from the extremity most inhabited about
seven and a-half or eight miles. Were the population at Gore-
bridge to attend, the situation is perhaps as convenient as any other.
The people in that district, however, being nearer, generally attend
the parochial ministrations at Borthwick.
   The church is in the best state of repair, and is seated for 500
persons; and five-sittings are provided at the communion tables
for about 40. The manse is an old building; and its last repair
took place about thirty-six or thirty-seven years ago. The glebe
consists of 14 Scots acres, and might be let for about L. 30. The
stipend is the minimum, and is made up by Government, all pay-
able in money.

to 1578,) when William Knox, brother to the Reformer, had the pastoral superin-
tendence of Cockpen, Carrington, Clerkington, and Tempill.
