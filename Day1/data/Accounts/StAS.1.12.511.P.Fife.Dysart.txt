   Manufactures.-The number of looms in the parish, is from
700 to 750, employed in making cheeks and ticks.  The
quantity of cloth made annually, is about 795,000 yards,
which being, at a medium, about 11 1/2 d. the yard, makes the
annual value of this manufacture 38,093 L. 15 s.  About half
the cloth is sold in London; a fourth, chiefly the coarse kinds,
in Glasgow; the other fourth in Manchester, Liverpool, Not-
tingham, Leeds, and some other towns in Yorkshire.  In the
linen trade, 10 hands are reckoned to be employed by each
loom; but as three-fourths of the flax consumed in this trade
are foreign, 7 to a loom may be a proper medium, which, for
725 looms, is+ 5075 people employed.  Seven-eights of the
flax used in making white or bleached yarns, are imported from
Riga, and spun in Fife.  What is used for the blue and dyed
yarns, is chiefly made from home grown flax:  but, as a suf-
ficient quantity cannot be got, Dutch flax is imported and
spun to make up the deficiency.  Of late years, a consider-
able quantity of coarse yarn has been imported from Bremen
and Hamburgh.  Not above a fourth of the yarn used in the
parish is spun in it.  The greatest inconveniency the trade la-
bours under, is a scarcity of good weavers.  People not qua-
lified to teach, take apprentices for 2 or 3 years, instead of a
longer period.  The apprentices, not attended to, get into

*From being m such variety of hands, it was difficult to form any calcula-
tion of the produce of these acres.  More wheat, and potatoes, and turnips, in
proportion, than in the country farms.
+That is more people than the parish contains, because a great proportion
of the flax is dressed and spun out of the parish.  The number of hands employ-
ed in this parish in this manufacture, is between 2000 and 3000, beginning at
the flax-dressers.
