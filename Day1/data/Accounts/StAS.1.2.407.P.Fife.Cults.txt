     (COUNTY OF FIFE.)

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   THE antient name of the parish was Qulkques or Quilques:
which, in the Gaelic, signifies, a "nook" or "corner."-it
being disjoined from the large strath, which runs from E. to W.
along the banks of the Eden.  It is situated in the presbytery
of Cupar, and in the synod and county of Fife: being about
1 1/2 English miles from E. to W. and about 2 1/4 from N. to S.
it consequently contains about 3.5 square miles, and is nearly
in the form of an oblong square.  It lies in the very heart of
Fife, and has easy access to both the coast of that county.

   Surface, Soil, and Air.-The general appearance is, partly
flat, declining to the north; but partly mountainous towards the
south.  The parish is remarkable, for a clear air and a light
soil.  The different kinds of soil are, gravel, a light black earth,
and a strong clay; with this particular circumstance, that, in
the lower parts, along the Eden, it is gravel inclining to heath,
and bent grass; from thence to the ascent of the hills, it is
light earth, and upon their declivity, it is strong clay.  Upon
