other circumstances that were thought unfriendly to inocu-
lation; and of the whole, there was not one who was not
easy under the disease, and had not a good recovery.  One
girl, indeed, after all hazard from the small-pox was over,
and her recovery in a manner complete, happened to over-

The parishioners here consist, in general, of farmers and their
families.  There is only one dissenter from the Established
Church.  There are very few mechanics; the farmers here,

The numbers in this parish, for 10 years past, have rather

average, produces 4 or 5 children.

   Agriculture.-No wheat is raised in the parish, and but
