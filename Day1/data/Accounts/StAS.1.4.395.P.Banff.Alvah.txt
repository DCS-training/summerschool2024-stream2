declivities.  Nor are there wanting fruitful fields on the up-
per grounds, interspersed amongst the rough pastures and
heath, which still occupy a very considerable part.  The
crops which are commonly cultivated are oats, barley, and
peas; and on some of the richer and more sheltered spots,
wheat has been tried with success.  Turnip, for 20 years
past, has been sown in the fields; and clover and rye-grass
have become a constant part of the rotation.  Feeding for
the butcher is carried on by a few; but rearing young
cattle has of late years been found a more lucrative branch,
and by consequence more generally practiced.  As farms
are not commonly let by the acre it cannot be said with
accuracy what value is put upon each.  The best arable
ground may rent about L. 1, or perhaps somewhat higher;
a still greater quantity about 15 s. and much more about
12 s. or 10 s. and even below that value.  There are only
a few farms inclosed, nor does that mode of melioration
keep pace with the other species of improvement.  Hedges
do not thrive, unless in places which are sheltered, as well
as fertile.  Feal or earthern fences have been found of short
duration, and stone fences are expensive.  But, though in-
closures are not so frequent as might be wished, the practice
of herding in winter is general; so that the turnip and
sown grasses sustain little detriment from straggling cattle.
Several of the farms are already brought to a very high
degree of cultivation, and others are advancing by gradual
progress to a like state of improvement.  About the year
1747, the minister began to bring home his peats in carts,
valued each at 4 s. 6 d.  Before that period the fuel was
carried in creels, and the corns in curracks; two imple-
ments of husbandry which, in this corner, are entirely dis-
used.  The straw brechem is now supplanted by the leather
collar, the rashen theets by the iron traces; and more is
