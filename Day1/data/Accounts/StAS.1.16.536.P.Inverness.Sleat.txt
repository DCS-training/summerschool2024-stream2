out in manuring potatoes.  That useful root is much, and
indeed necessarily cultivated here, the inhabitants living
great part of the year on potatoes, and various sorts of fish,
chiefly herrings, shoals of which regularly and providen-
tially make their appearance in almost all the bays and
lochs round the island, about the 20th of July, and gene-
rally remain in less or greater bodies till the middle of De-
cember.  Nature, indeed, seems to have made some pro-
vision for the support of the inhabitants of this land, as the
fish casts up nearly at the time that the meal is consumed.
There may be planted in the parish of Sleat about 300
bolls of potatoes.  Their measure is a herring-barrel filled,
of such they allow three to a boll; what proportion this
bears to the legal measure in the Low Country, I know
not, but there may be 900 barrels planted annually, but it
is to be understood, that this is almost altogether done in
the lazy-bed way.  What attaches the inhabitants to this
mode of planting potatoes is, that they conceive the ground
requires less preparation than when planted in the drill.
Of oats there are from 4 to 6 returns; potatoes from 10 to
14; there have been from 34 to 38 returns in the drill
way, but this held nowhere but in small spots, where the
preparation of the ground was much attended to.  There
are only 12 ploughs in the parish; the other implements
of tillage are garden and crooked spades.  Lintseed is sown
here with success, though in small quantities, but enough
to show that the ground is well adapted to such purpose.
   The fuel is entirely turf or peat; it is unnecessary to de-
scribe the process of cutting and drying it; but I am sorry
to observe, that this article takes up a great proportion of
the farmer's time, and that very often their labour is in
vain, particularly when the latter end of summer, and the
beginning of autumn, happens to be rainy, which unfortu-
nately is too often the case in the Western Highlands, and
