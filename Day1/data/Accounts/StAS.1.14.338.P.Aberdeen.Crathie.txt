millions of the former, and upwards of a million of
larch, with a great variety of others.  Mr. Gordon of
Abergeldie has planted Scotch firs to a very considerable
extent, besides other trees; and the Earl of Fife has
also made plantations of Scotch firs, and other kinds.

   Rivers, Lakes, &c.- The Dee is the principal river.
It has its source on a hill called Gaibh-chor-Dhe, in
Lord Fife's forest; and running through the united pa-
rishes of Braemar and Crathy, and a great many other 
parishes, with vast rapidity, empties itself into the
German ocean at Aberdeen, at the distance of about 90
miles, in a straight line from its source.  If the wind-
ings of the river were measured, it would be little short
of 50 more.  It produces salmon and trout in great plen-
ty, with some pike and eel.  Several small rivers and
rivulets fall into the Dee before it reaches Crathy, par-
ticularly the Geallaidh, the Luidh, the Eidh, the Coich,
the Cluanaidh, etc., which are all well stored with ex-
cellent trout:  the Cluanaidh produces salmon.  In the
parish of Braemar, there are many lins or cascades,
particularly those of Coich, the Mulzie, the Garrabh-
alt, etc.; but the lin that deserves most notice, is that of
the Dee, not so much on account of the height of the 
fall, as the singularity of the rivers being confined for
upwards of 60 yards between two rocks, within so nar-
row a space, that some persons have been fool hardy
enough to step from the one rock to the other.  The 
principal lakes in the parishes, are Loch Callader and
Loch Bhrotachan, both on Mr. Farquharson's property,
and well stored with excellent trout.  Loch Callader pro-
duces fine little salmon, of about 7 or 8 lbs. weight, and
