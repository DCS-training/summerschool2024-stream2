   Roads and Bridges.-The roads were formerly made and
kept in repair by the statute labour; but that method was
found inconvenient, and ineffectual, for making and keeping
up good roads.  Some years ago, an act of Parliament was
obtained for the country of Argyle, converting the statute la-
bour into money, to be paid at the rate of 2 s. by every male
person above 14 years of age.  There is also an assessment
upon the land, at the rate of 1 s. per pound of valued rent, a
third of which is payable by the proprietors, and two-thirds
by the tenants.  The great military road from Dumbarton,
to the West and North-west Highlands, goes through 16
miles of the upper end of this parish; but upon the west
coast of lonch-long, and upon both sides of Loch-goil, there
is scarce so much as a path; the ruggedness of the country
renders travelling extremely difficult, and the many large
and rapid waters without bridges, make these parts of the
parish often impassable.  It is found very difficult to keep up
the bridges in many parts of the country; the rivers swell so
suddenly, and rush down from the mountains with such ra-
pidity, that the bridges much be built in very advantageous
situations, in order to stand any time.  There is one bridge
in particular, near Lochgoil-head, which has fallen three
times, within the last 15 years; it was built at first, and
twice rebuilt, at the expence of the inhabitants.

   Character of the People.-The tacksmen of this parish are

and morals; the tenants are sober and industrious; the cot-
tagers are rather indolent, especially after they are successful
in the herring fishing; and too many of them spend their
time, from the beginning of January to the beginning of
April, without any employment, but preparing their nets for
the ensuing season.  To this, however, there are many ex-
