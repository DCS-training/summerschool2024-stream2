   Every thing else is in proportion with those entered in
the above tables.  To there things the change in the way
of living is to be added.  Tables are conducted in a diffe-
rent style; and ale has given place to punch, and punch to
wine.
   When the particulars stated are duly attended to, Mr
Keith's conclusion from similar premisses appears reasonable.
"Upon the whole matter," says he, "this much seems to
"be certain, that for all domestic uses L. 100 at the time
"we are now speaking of," ann. 1563, "was, at a mode-
"rate computation, as valuable in all points as L. 700 are
"now a-days." -N.B.  Keith wrote, I think, before
the year 1740*.

   Effects of the Decrease of the Value of Money upon the
Ministers of Religion.-This great change in the value of
money has ruined many who were dependent on salaries
fixed 80 or an 100 years ago; and unless relief is given,
many more must suffer the same hard fate.  No set of
men feel this change more than the ministers of this Na-
tional Church, who are generally paid, not in kind, but in
money.  When their stipends were first appointed, L. 60,
according to a safe calculation, was equal to L. 180 now.
   The progress of society calls aloud, Confine not the mi-
nisters of religion to their ancient appointments.  Why?
say the needy, the greedy, and the graceless, Is not a poor
church most like to be a pure church?  Those men who
have hackneyed this saying allow, when their interest is
out of the way, that poverty is often as great an enemy to
virtue as wealth.  We plead not for overgrown wealth.
We only humbly crave, that our income may rise as the
necessary expence of living increases.
