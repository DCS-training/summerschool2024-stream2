     of Dornock.

L. 90 sterling.  The manse was rebuilt in 1778.  The church
is small and inconvenient.
   There is a school-house, and a very good schoolmaster.  His
salary is only 100 merks Scots, paid by the heritors; which,
with the school-wages, may amount to L. 18 or L. 20 a year:
a poor pittance to live on, for any man of education and parts,
which even a country school-master ought to be.  The num-
ber of scholars, summer and winter, may, on an average, be from
50 or 60.  They are taught reading English, writing, arith-
metic, geometry, accounts, and a few even Latin.
   The number of poor at present upon the list, are 18.  There
are no funds for their maintenance, but the sunday collections,
which, will scarcely amount to 3s. a week, together with the
small sum of 10s. yearly, left them by an heritor.

   Agriculture, etc.-There are 60 ploughs in the parish, 66
carts, and 48 wheel-cars, or tumbrils.  The ploughs are all of the
English make, with the curved mouldboard, and drawn by two
horses without any driver.
   The parish is partly inclosed with hedges and ditches, and
partly with earth and stone dikes.  The farmers, in gene-
ral, are very sensible of the benefit of inclosures, but are not
always inclined to take proper care of their hedges after they
are planted.  More provisions are raised in the district than is
equal to its comsuption.  The annual exports may be nearly
as follow.
