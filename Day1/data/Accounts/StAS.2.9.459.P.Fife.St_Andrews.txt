	Castle of St Andrews, by his uncle, the Duke of Albany, the Re-
	gent of the kingdom, previous to his removal to Falkland, where
	he was starved to death.-A few years afterwards John Resby and
	Paul Craw, were committed to the flames at St Andrews, for pro-
	pagating what was then held to be heretical doctrine.-In 1471,
	the Bishop of St Andrews was invested by the Pope with archie-
	piscopal dignity, and this his successors in office, whether of the
	Romish or of the Protestant faith, afterwards retained.-After the
	tenets of the Reformation had begun to be disseminated in Scot-
	land, several individuals were tried at St Andrews, as supporters of
	the new opinions, and condemned to the flames.  Among these
	were Patrick Hamilton, Abbot of Fearn, and nephew to the Earl
	of Arran; and George Wisbart, son of the proprietor of Pittarrow,
	in the Mearns, whose cruel and untimely deaths were greatly la-
	mented by the community at large.  The celebrated George Bu-
	chanan avoided a similar fate, by escaping from imprisonment in
	the Castle of St Andrews.-These events were followed by the
	murder of Cardinal Beaton in 1546, and the subsequent siege, sur-
	render, and partial demolition of the castle, which had been garri-
	soned by the conspirators.  Two of what, it is supposed, were cannon
	balls, employed at that siege, were some years ago found by some
	young men among the rocks in the immediate vicinity of the castle.
	They are now in the custody of the Professor of Chemistry, and
	were covered when found, with a calcareous incrustation.  The
	one of them bad undergone a considerable alteration, being soft on
	the surface, and resembling a carburet of iron, while the other re-
	tained its original hardness.-In June 1583, James VI. escaped
	from the influence of the noblemen who bad placed him under per-
	sonal restraint at Ruthven, by entering the Castle of St Andrews,
	where he was soon joined by a number of his well-affected subjects.
	This prince frequently visited St Andrews while he remained in
	Scotland; and when, after his accession to the English throne, he
	returned to it in 1617, St Andrews was by no means overlooked.
	Here he had directed the prelates, and a number of the influential
	clergy, to meet him, that he might unfold to them his views, rela-
	tive to subsequent ecelesiastical arrangements.-In 1645, the Scot-
	tish Parliament held its meetings in St Andrews, and among other
	proceedings condemned to death Sir Robert Spottiswood, son of the
	archbishop of that name, and three other gentlemen who had sup-
	ported the royal cause, and had been taken prisoners at the battle
	of Philiphaugh, and who were afterwards executed in the princi-
	pal street of the city.-In May 1679, James Sharp, Archbishop of
