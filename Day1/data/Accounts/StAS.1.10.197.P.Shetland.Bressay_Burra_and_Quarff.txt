them.  Others, whose grounds are wet, have dug deep
trenches, to dry and to divide their fields; and, by throwing
the earth upon the ridges, greatly meliorate the soil, and
raise 2 or 3 good crops without any manure.  The soil of
Quarff is likewise clay, and, in ordinary seasons, produces
tolerable crops, though rather late, on account of the wetness
of the ground.  The soil of Burra is of different kinds.  In
some places it is sandy, in others a fine black earth.  In good
years, it produces gram sufficient for the consumpt of the in-
habitants.  The people here manage their hay crop in a very
absurd manner.  They never cut it but when wet; they al-
low it to lie 2 or 3 weeks, even in the finest weathers and
will not touch it, however dry, till it gets some showers, and
is bleached by the rains.  By this time the substance is gone.
So obstinate are their prejudices on this head, that it is im-
possible to convince them of their error.  The fishing is a
great obstacle to improvements in agriculture, the chief ob-
ject of the proprietors being to have as many fishermen upon
their grounds as possible.  The farms, consequently, are very
small.  Few leases are granted.  Many services, the sad
marks of slavery, are demanded.  They must fish for their
masters, who either give them a fee entirely inadequate to
their labour and their dangers, or take their fish at a low-
er price than others would give.  It is true, that, in years of
scarcity, they must; depend upon their landlords for the means
of subsistence, and are often deep in their debt.  But why
not allow them to make the best of their situation?  Why
not let them have leases upon reasonable terms, and dispose
of their produce to those who will give them the belt price?
Why not let them fish for themselves?  Why should the
laird have any claim except for the stipulated rent?  Neither
the climate nor the soil are favourable to improvements in
