another to lead the horses, one to direct the iron that cuts
the ground before the plough, and another to lead the horse 
that draws it.  The gentlemen who possess the principal
farms have given up this aukward machine, and introduced
in its place the plough generally used in the low country,
which they find much more convenient.  The thin ground,
which does not admit of the plough, is turned up with an
instrument called the crooked spade, which is described by
Dr Johnson in his tour.  There are only 8 carts in the
parish, where some hundreds might be used to advantage;
most of the farms being so level, that carts might be easily 
drawn over them.

   Climate.-In no country can the climate be more varia-
ble than in this.  There are instances of frost, snow, fleet,
and deluges of rain, in the course of the same day.  High 
gales of wind  are frequent throughout the year, but parti-
cularly the vernal and autumnal equinoxes are attended
with storms that sometimes prove fatal in their effects upon
corn and cattle.  Westerly winds, with hazy weather,
prevail for two-thirds of the year.  At the same time, the
climate is not unhealthy, there being no distempers pecu-
liar to it; coughs, colds, and the rheumatism, prevail
here as in other places.

   Fresh Water Lakes.-There is such a number of fresh-
water lakes in this parish, that a person standing on the 
top of a hill in the middle of it, would imagine, that 1/4th
part of it is covered with water.  Some of these lakes
are very large, and contain a great number of rocks
and islands, where wild-fowl, such as geese, ducks, sea-
gulls, &c. build their nests, and hatch their young.  The 
whole of them are full of trout, which, in size and quality,
are equal to any in the kingdom.
