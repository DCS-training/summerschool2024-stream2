  Were this understanding to become general, the farmer would
be encouraged to give full attention to the procuring of foreign
manure to make up for the loss sustained by the grain raised not
being consumed on the farm.  This, it is believed, might be ac-
complished in a district such as this, by water-meadows, or simply
by cutting, were it only for the dunghill, immense masses of ferns,
heath, and above all "sprits," which are allowed to grow up and
rot on the hills, and which, at best, only increase annually the
quantity of peat bog.  With the sprits, and even with the ferns, if
cut green and well salted, they might winter in the straw yard an
additional number of cattle, and thus add both to their purse and
their dunghill, without deducting a single comfort from their sheep;
nay, adding many, in the sweetness and variety of the young and
tender grasses that would spring up.  And again, let an inch,--
more or less,--of new mould, nay, even of " till," be brought up
at every rotation of turnip fallow, and well incorporated with the
now rich old soil, and we venture to say, that the productive qua-
lity of our fields will again return, and will soon repay all the ad-
ditions benefit that had been heaped upon them.
