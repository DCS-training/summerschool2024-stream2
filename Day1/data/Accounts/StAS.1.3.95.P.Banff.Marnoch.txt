wood, viz. common fir, sprunce, larix, and pine, beech, oak,
elm, ash, birch, and alder, most of them in a very thriving
condition, and some of them well advanced in size.  There
being no measurement of the parish, the extent of the
farms cannot be precisely ascertained.  There are farms that
pay rent from L. 40 to L. 70 Sterling, and many lesser ones
from L. 10 to L. 8 Sterling, and a very great number of
small cross from L. 5 and L. 6 down to L. 1 of rent.

   Disease.-The air is wholesome, and the people in general
healthy.  Except a few tradesmen, they are not employed in
a sedentary life; being either country gentlemen, farmers, or
crosters, their business occasions them to be much in the
open air.  No local distempers take place in this parish,
consumptions and fevers are the most prevalent.

   Rent, Etc.-The rent of the parish is L. 2300 Sterling
yearly.  The only language spoken in it is English.

   Church.-The church is very old, and in a very ruinous
condition.  James Donaldson, Esq; of Kinnairdie, is the pa-
tron.  About twenty years ago, the church was repaired, and
galleries were erected sufficient to accommodate 300 people.
A new and much larger church is to be built next year,
which clearly shows the increase of population here, occa-
sioned partly by a good many extensive farms being parcelled
out and let in crosts, which also made a considerable in-
crease of rent to the heritors.

   The living was augmented in 1789; and is now L.45 in
money, 90 bolls of meal, and 22 bolls of bear.  There are
ten heritors in this parish, four of whom reside in it,
