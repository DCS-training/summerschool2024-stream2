ficial mode of cropping his grounds, he had resorted to the
practice of fallowing his fields every second year.  This
practice, he added, not only had enabled him to subdue the
tendency of the ground to be covered with annual weeds,
(a tendency which, in Sweden, is peculiarly strong), but
gives him, at an average, a better return from the one crop
which he takes, than any of his neighbours have, on equally
good soil, in their two crops without fallow.
   Change of feed could not fail to be highly beneficial as
an improvement in the farming of Dowally.  In the
change of feed, the farmer should attend particularly to this
consideration, that new seed will thrive best with him,
which he gets from a climate and soil opposite in nature to
his own.
   As soon as his white crops are removed from the fields
to the barn-yard, he ought to begin to plough them.  By
this plan he will find the labours of the spring made more
easy, and the ground will be reduced to a finer tilth, and at
the same time fertilized by the effects of the winter's frosts.
Often, in the Highlands, the ground receives but one fur-
row, after lying unploughed till March or April.  This
happens even if the ground is lee.  Where this is the prac-
tice, no one need be surprised to see it in bad tilth, prolisic
of weeds, and yielding a more abundant crop of grass than
of the grain that happens to be sown on it.  In very steep
grounds, indeed, autumnal tillage should not be attempted,
as the violent winter rains would wash off the soil.  In eve-
ry other case, it will not fail to be beneficial, and to increase
the quantity of produce.
   The time of sowing the different grains ought to be more
early in the season than it is at present.  Able agricultu-
rists are of opinion, that little hazard would attend oats
or barley, even if they were sown in autumn.  They
