lime, marl, and dung.  The first of these, though distant
20 miles, and from some places 25, is in general very much
used.  As the land, owing to this distance, and to the ad-
vance in the price of cattle, wages of servants, etc. is im-
proved at a great expence; the profit of the former scarce-
ly bears a just proportion to the increase of rent, and of e-
very other article.
   The English plough drawn by 2 horses, has superseded the
old heavy Scotch plough drawn by 4 oxen and 2 horses.
The rotation of crops upon the clay land is fallow, succeeded
by wheat; pease, barley laid down with grass and opened
with oats.  Upon the dry light land, it is fallow or turnip,
barley laid down with grass and opened with oats.  The
wheat is of an excellent quality; the barley good, though
inferior to that of the lower parts of Roxburghshire and
Berwickshire; the oats in general produce, at an average,
near 8 stone the boll, Linlithgow measure.  Those of Blains-

any soil and exposure to which they are carried.  There is
a great demand for them from England and different parts
of Scotland, and they commonly fetch some shillings the
boll above the ordinary price of seed oats.
   The parish contains 280 hordes, 1006 black cattle, 13,720
sheep.  The black cattle are of a middling size, and excellent
for fattening; in general, they do not exceed 60 stone when
slaughtered.  The sheep are of a breed between the long
white-faced humble sheep, from the south of Teviotdale,
and the short Highland kind.  In smearing, to one pint of
tar was formerly used only 2 lb. butter, but now 3 lb. and
sometimes 4 lb. by which, though less smearing materials
are found necessary, the expence is greater; but in return,
the quantity of the wool is thereby increased, and the qua-
