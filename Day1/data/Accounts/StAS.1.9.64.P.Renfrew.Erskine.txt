and by introducing fallow crops and sown grasses, the
ground would be gradually improved, and its produce up-
on the whole augmented, so as more than to repay the ad-
ditional expence.  That he might be well acquainted with
the nature and the powers of the soil, as well as set an ex-
ample to the country, he took under his own management
the parks of Erskine, and two or three farms in the neigh-
bourhood.  The system which he pursued was nearly as
follows:  After the previous necessary operations of inclo-
sing, draining, clearing of stones, &c. he took a crop of oats.
The following year, after three and sometimes four
ploughings, and plentiful liming and dunging, he took a
fallow crop.  For this he preferred turnips, as he never
failed to have a large return of them, as they stood the win-
ter better than cabbage, and left the ground in better con-
dition than potatoes; and, as the soil had not sufficient
depth for carrots or parsnips, the third year he laid down
the field with grass-seeds.  As a crop or nurse to the grass
seeds, he tried wheat, barley, and early Essex oats.  The
first did not succeed well, and upon the whole he gave the
preference to the last.  He cut the hay for one or two
years thereafter, and then allowed the ground to remain in
pasture.
   Soon after he settled at Erskine, the leases of most of the
farms in the barony expired.  He was very unwilling to
dispossess the old families, some of whom had occupied
these grounds for generations.  He knew at the same time,
that they had neither stock nor skill sufficient to enable
them to pay a rent adequate to the real value of the land.
He proposed to them to pay a very moderate advance of
rent, less indeed than most of them expected, with about 7
or 8 per cent. of the expence of inclosing; but that they
should be bound to observe a mode of management similar
to his own; in particular, that they should not have two
