specially when uncontroulable, as at present, by any superior
tribunal, will always be viewed with jealousy, and is in dan-

presented in it by one member or commissioner.  It is now
only one of 5 boroughs, who, all together, send but one mem-
ber to the British Parliament; the other four are Perth, For-
far, St. Andrews, and Coupar in Fife.  Every one of the
