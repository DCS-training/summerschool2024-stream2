thnuich, the Wood of Trembling, (Killicranky) from its aw-
ful appearance.  Fonn a-vuic, the Land of the (Roe) Buck.
Bo-rainich, the Ferry Booths.  Loch-loch, a loch consisting of
lochs, because it is in three divisions.  Each of the rivers gives
a name to the valley, or glen it runs through :  They also ge-
nerally give names to the lakes, whence they slow.

   Antiquities-On the East bank of the Tilt, which falls in-
to the Garry, south east of Atholl-house, is Clagh-ghil-Ain-
dreas, or the cemetery of Andrew's disciple.  What the Tilt
has left of it, is a part of a circle ; many of the bones are entire,
but crumble to pieces, when touched.  The cossins are com-
posed of five flafs each, and seem to have been used, to save
the trouble of making wooden cossins ; or probably, to pre-

stood Andersmafs market, which is now held at Perth.  Here
was a large white stone, which was the market cross, and re-
mained upon a little raised circle of earth, till Duke James's
time.  To the eastward of the cemetery, there are the remains
of a large Druidical cairn ; but the small ones have been most-
ly carried away.  About a quarter of a mile up the same bank
of the Tilt, is one of those round castles, that are so frequent
in these countries, and which probably answered the purposes

farther up, stands Tom-a-vuir, (Tom-a-mhuir), or the hill of the
well, or fort ; where, it is faid, the M'Intoshes of Tiriny lived of
old.  It is strongly situated on a steep bank of the river Tilt.
   About a mile to the eastward of Tilt, lies Strath-groy,
(Srath-ghruaidh, or Srath-dhrunidh,) i. e. probably, the valley
of the Druids.  About the middle of it, and not a surlong
from the river, Mr Stewart, who farms that land, lately dug
up a stone, of about 6 feet long, above a foot broad, and half
