   Bleachfields.-There are two in this parish, though that at
Wellhouse is now partly removed into the Barony parish, the
original field is in Old Monkland.  Messrs. Gray laid out
their ground with great judgment and expence.  They were
the first in this country who bleached after the Dutch me-
thod; and for their diligence and ingenuity obtained a consi-
derable premium from government.  Business is still carried
on to a large extent.

   Carmylefield-Was erected in 1741, by Mr M'Kenzie, an
enterprising merchant of Glasgow.  Nothing can exceed the
beauty of its situation, having a fine southern exposure,
washed by the Clyde.  About 50 people are employed; men
get 7 s, women S s per week.  Many thousand pieces of light
muffin are done here annually.  This field, which contains
upwards of 10 acres, has some peculiar advantages:  There
is a well 6 feet deep, which fills in 12 hours The water is
carried 510 feet, and runs 3 gallons in a minute.  Much
praise is due to the proprietors for their attention to the mo-
rals of their servants.
