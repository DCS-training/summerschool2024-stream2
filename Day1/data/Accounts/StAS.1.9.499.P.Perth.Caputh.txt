   Prices and Wages.-The price of all kinds of provisions
has risen considerably within these few years; that of 
poultry, in particular, is almost double what it was in 83.
The avearage price of beef, mutton, veal, lamb, and pork,
through the year, is 3 1/2 d.  the Dutch pound.  Poultry, 10 d,
or 1 s.; a chicken, 3 d.; a dozen of eggs, 3 d.; butter, 6 d.
the English pound; cheese from 4 s. to 6 s. the stone, of 
16 pounds, the pound containing 22 ounces; potatoes, 6 d.
the peck, of 2 stones Dutch or meal weight.  The prices
of grain are for the most part lower than in the Hadding-
ton market.  As the farmers usually sell on credit, and de-
liver in December, January, &c.  what is not to paid 
till midsummer following, they get a higher price than
they would otherwise receive.  Barley, of crop 1791, was
from 15 s. to 18 s. the boll; oats from 12 s. to 15 s.; seed
oats from 16 s. to 17 s.; peace from 13 s. to 15 s.; oat-
meal from 15 s. 4 d. to 16 s.  The prices are in general
higher for crop 1792.-Servants, both male and female,
are commonly hired for the whole year.  The best man
servant for husbandry receives L. 10 or L. 12; an ordina-
ry one from L. 6 to L. 8.  They either have their visuals
in the farmer's house, or in lieu of visuals, 6 bolls and a
half of oat-meal, and milk from his dairy.  Female ser-
vants receive from L. 3 to L. 4.  A man, for harvest work,
gets from L. 1 to L. 1, 18 s.; a woman from 16 s. to L. 1;

mer had been severe.  The crop was uncommonly fertile, and generally
got in about the middle of September N. S.  Before Martinmas 1741.
the price of meal fell to L. 6 Scots the boll.  In consequence of the very
late and unproductive crop of 1782. the price of oat-meal again role, in
the summer of 1783. to L. 1 the boll.  In August that year the heritors 
and kirk-session directed L. 12 to be taken from the parish-funds, and di-
stributed in the course of four weeks; and soon after, 10 bolls 1 sirlot
and 1 peck of the meal, which was sent to Scotland by order of Govern-
ment. were received and distributed in like manner.  By these means, a
temporary relief was afforded to many of the industrious poor.
