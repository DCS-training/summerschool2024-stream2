     of Sandwick and Stromness.

years ago, moorfowl frequented some of the hills, and were
shot within a mile of the village of Stromness, but now
there is no heath there, nor are moorfowl to be found in
either of there parishes.

   Plants.-There are no plants here but such as are com-
mon in this county, and have been repeatedly described.
The scurvy-grass abounds in many places, and grows on
the roofs, and along the walls of old houses in the village
of Stromness.  Small black, or whortle berries, probably
similar to the vaccinia nigra of Virgil, but of inferior qua-
lity, were formerly found on the hills in the vicinity of
the village of Stromness; but none grow there now and
they are rarely to be met with on any of the hills of these
parishes.

   Molucca Beans.-These have sometimes, but rarely,
been found along the sea-coasts of there parishes.

   Clairk Geese, Barnacles.-These have been found sticking
to pieces of timber, as described by Wallace in his descrip-
tion of Orkney, and also by Sir Robert Sibbald, in his Na-
tural History of Scotland, book 3. part 2. chap. 12. under
the article Concha Anatifera.  A late author asserts, that
the barnacles lay their eggs, and leaving them at the mer-
cy of the waves, they stick to what they happen to meet
with, rotten timber, or maritime plants, and so are
hatched.

   Figured Stones.-On the west side of Sandwick parish,
along the craggy cliffs, are found, horizontally laid, cause-
ways, or stratums of figured stones, of various in irregular fi-
gures, the work of nature, and the effect of time; but
none of these figured stones bear any resemblance to birds
