   Fish.-In the river Ness are salmon, bull trouts, and
flounders.  The salmon-fishing begins on the 30th of No-
vember, and ends the 18th of September.  The Berwick
Fishing Company have fished this river near 40 years.
They pay L. 230 a-year to the proprietors of the lower
division of the river, and about L. 100 to the proprietors of
the upper division, beyond the cruives and bulwarks, as a
compensation for the Saturday slop, or breach in the bul-
warks, from the setting of the sun on Saturday, till its ri-
sing on Monday; to which the heritors of this division, to
let the fish pass upward, are entitled by statute.  The quan-
tity of salmon caught in the river is believed to amount,
one year with another, to 300 or 350 barrels.  In the be-
ginning of the season, the salmon is packed in kits for the
London market, and fetches a high price.  The lease of
the Berwick Fishing Company is nearly expired; it is said
a renewal of it will not be obtained for less than double
the present rent.  There is but little of the salmon sold
here, and that little, by favour to particular persons, at 3 d.
the lb.  The bull trouts are not packed, but sold here,
and at 3 d. the lb.; some of them are very large, weigh-
ing from 10 to 12 lb.  They generally, however, weigh
only from 3 to 4 lb.  The flounders are not good; their
flesh, like that of all fresh water flounders, is soft, and of
indifferent flavour.  The sea-coast is 3 miles long, and flat
and sandy.  The fish caught on this coast, are herrings, and
garvocks, or sprats.  The herrings are small, but very de-
licious, if dressed the day they are caught.  They are only
occasional visitants on this coast.  In some years, there is
not the least appearance of them; in others, less or more
scanty; but a great and plentiful show may be said to be
rather uncommon.  Two or three adventurers on the boun-
ty, in plentiful years, fished here, and it is said, with tole-
