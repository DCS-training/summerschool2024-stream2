southern portion, which is high and rocky.  There are two head-
lands remarkable for the view which they command of the parish,
the one called Kenm•r, the other Stronshira.
   Climate.-The climate of the country may be described as va-
riable.  Heavy rains, hail, and snow alternate with frost and warm
sunshine sometimes in the course of the same day.  The generally
moist state of the atmosphere implies a climate rather mild than
severe, and accordingly frosts are for the most part of short dura-
tion; the snow seldom continues upon the plains above two, or,
at most, three days, and melts off from the greater number of our
mountains without doing much injury to the sheep.  The undulat-
ing outline formed by height and hollow with the woods which are
spread everywhere, affords protection from every blast, and some-
times evaporation is so slow that the straw with which the cottages
are thatched, rots much sooner than in more exposed situations.
For the same reason, every tree and shrub is overgrown with nume-
rous mosses and lichens, which clothe the stem with their ever-
green leaves or hang in festoons from the highest branches.
   The following is a table of the weather, as taken from a record
kept at Inverary, from Ist January 1833 to 1st January 1836.  The
pressure of the atmosphere was ascertained bv means of Adie's sym-
piesometer ; an instrument exceedingly delicate, but so nearly ac-
cordant with a good wheel barometer which stood beside it, that
the whole difference between them consisted in the quicker indi-
cations of the former.  Both stood about 25 feet above the level
of the sea.  The thermometer was placed at a window with a north-
west aspect, and as much removed from radiation as possible.  The
observations on both were taken at 9 o'clock A. M., at 2 P. M., and
at 9 P. M.  The rain-gage used was also of Mr Adie`'s construction,
and was placed in the Duke of Argyle's garden, by permission, on
the top of a wall about twenty feet high.  It was removed in Ja-
nuary 1834, to Glenaray, about 300 feet above the level of the
sea.  Both situations were carefully chosen, with a view to ren-
der the observations as accurate as possible.
