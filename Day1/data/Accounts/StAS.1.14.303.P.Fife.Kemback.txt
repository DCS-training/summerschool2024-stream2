this proportion rests on a single experiment).  It resist
frost better than turnip; after shooting in the spring,
the root still remains juicy and succulent, and even after
the seed is ripened upon the stalk, a considerable part of
the root remains fit for the use of cattle.  
   Threshing machines have been lately introduced here,
and though there has not been time for them to receive
the sanction of experience in their favour, yet as they
perform  a great quantity of work in a very short time,
and cut off almost every opportunity of embezzlement,
they promise to constitute a valuable improvement upon
an extensive farm.
   There are no fewer than 3 corn mills in the parish;
but, from this circumstance, little or no benefit accrues
to the inhabitants in the way of competition, as almost
all the lands are bound thirle to one or other of them.
The multure exacted by these mills, is, I believe, almost
precisely the same.  It cannot be expressed in general
terms, because it is drawn in grain, and partly in meal.
By a calculation upon oats, I found, that when the boll
of oats produces a boll of meal, the multure is 1-13th,
and when the boll produces only 3 firlots of meals, the
multure is 1-12th of the quantity sent to the mill,  This
suggests an inducement, which, along with many others,
should dispose farmers to pay attention to raise grain of
the best quality, as the multure is always less in propor-
tion as the quality is finer.
   The rents of farms are vaious.  Of late, there has ap-
peared in this neighbourhod a tendency to offer higher
rents for farms, than the average prices of corn and
cattle, and the improvements of the art seemed to justify-
The same spirit of unfounded speculation, which had per-
vaded several other orders of Society, seized upon farm-
