   no's, Pillar, near Forres, are sculptured on it, * but it is scarcely
   half the height of the Forres obelisk.  The sculpture is nearly the
   same on both sides of the stone, but in the lowest compartment
   on one of them are two figures, seemingly in the Highland dress,
   and in the attitude of embrace.  There is no trace of any writing,
   and tradition describes it to be a memorial of the unhappy fate of
   a Celtic princess, who eloped with a Danish lover, and was pur-
   sued to the,birch-covered hill, called the Doune of Dunearn, on
   the verge of the Findhorn, from which, to avoid their pursuers,
   they precipitated themselves into the river, and perished together.
      On the, time of the old military road from Fort-George to Perth,
   made by General Wade, which passes through the parish, there
   is the fine old bridge of Dulcie, crossing the Findhorn, and situ-
   ated in a most romantic sppt,-the rocky and precipitous, but
   deeply wooded, banks of the river, the dark hue of its rapid stream,
   and the bold arch of the old bridge itself, combining with the
   character of the scenery around it to form a truly beautiful land-
   scape.
     On the summit of the hill of Lethenbar, which stands 862
   feet above the level of the sea, in latitude 57&deg; 31' 24" north, lon-
   gitude 3&deg; 4' 38" west, there is a very perfect Druidical circle, and
   in its immediate neighbourhood are numerous tumuli.
     Mansion-Houses.-Tbe only mansion-house within the parish is
   Coulmony House, the property of Mr Brodie of Lethen.  On a tablet
   over the door is inscribed the date 1746.  It is situated on the banks
   of the Findhorn, and the scenery around is justly celebrated for its
   highland beauty.  The late Sir James Montgomery Cuning-
   hame, commenced to build a mansion-house on his estate of
   Fairness, on the opposite bank of the river; but unhappily lie did
   not live to finish it.

              The amount in 1755, was   1163
                            1797,   -   1186
                            1801,   -   1256 whereof 540 males, 716 females.
                            1809,   -   1186
                            1821,   -   1287
                            1831,   -   1270, whereof 596 males, 674 females.
                            1841,   -   1177

     The principal cause of the decrease in the population during
   the last twenty years is emigration.  The yearly average of births
   in the parish during the last seven years is 14, and of marriages, 4.
