size, has not increased in wealth; and is not now as it was tire,
"the most fashionable sea-bathing place on the west coast."
   Though agriculture has made progress, the system of husbandry
seems still capable of improvement; and one improvement would
be, a more extended system of furrow-draining over all the heavy
grounds in the upper part of the parish. This, by ameliorating the
soil and the climate, would render the crops earlier and more abun-
dant; and the pastures more kindly and nutritive. Another evi-
dent improvement would be, determined and persevering hostility
against the myriads of docks and ragweeds, and nettles, and
thistles which hold so prominent a place in many of our fields,
wasting their strength, and rendering them unsightly.
   But the most magnificent improvement of which this parish is sus-
ceptible is the fertilization of about 1200 acres of sandhills. That,
in a few years, this barren range might be rendered not only beau-
tiful, but of great value, is not an opinion of yesterday; but was
held forty-six years ago by the very intelligent and respectable
writer of the last Statistical Report. There are two ways of im-
proving, this savage tract: the one by converting it into a forest,
the other by bringing it into pasture, and eventually, perhaps, into
arable ground; for there is proof, in the parish, that it is capable of
bearing trees, or of becoming rich pasture, and even of yielding
good crops. The beautiful fields in the neighbourhood of Sea-
Bank, and the glebe, were originally covered with sand.
