   Villages.-OXNAM was once large and populous; but, at
present, there are hardly cottagers in it sufficient for the pro-
per culture of the land, and only 4 tradesmen.  Newbigging
has been possessed by portioners, who hold of the Marquis
of Lothian, since 1611.  The sole property of it, how-
ever, falls to his Lordship at Martinmas 1815, according to
the decision of Lord Justice Clerk, to whom it was referred
by both parties.  Swinside, Dolphiston, and Mossburnford,
are inconsiderable villages.

   Church, etc.-The church was built in 1738, has undergone
considerable alterations, and is in pretty good repair.  The

of farms.  Not to multiply instances, in the village of Oxnam, between 60 and 70
years ago, there were 22 tenants, who kept about 16 ploughs, drawn by
oxen and 2 horses, driven by a boy; whereas now, 3 persons occupy the whole,
and have only 7 ploughs, drawn by a horses.
*The parish register was accurately kept, from 1700 to 1710, during
which, the births amounted to 398, annual average 40 nearly.  Since that pe-
riod, the register has not been so accurate; occasioned, chiefly, by the neglect
of parents to have a very trifling expence.  Within the last 10 years, the annual
average of births has been about 15, of which only 10 are registered.
+There is an instance of one marriage producing 22 births, and of 2 mar-
riages out of there, producing each 15.
++During the above period, the mortcloth has been used 107 times, 90 of
which were for interments in this church-yard.  There is stone in the church-
yard, bearing the ages of a father and mother, 2 sons, a daughter-in-law, and
3 grandchildren, amounting to 618, average 77 years; the oldest of whom was
98, and the youngest 70.
There is a remarkably distinct echo from the church to a small eminence,
170 yards directly E, of it, in the level of the gallery.
