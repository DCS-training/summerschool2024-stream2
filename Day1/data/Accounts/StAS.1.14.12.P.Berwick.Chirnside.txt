   The beds of marl, so precious in estimation by the
gentlemen, did not correspond to what the tenants expect-
ed from the use of it, as a manure. 300 loads of it re-
quired to an acre of ground, was found an insuperable la-
bour; however great its ultimate benefit was understood
to be, its lumpy and hard substance did not dissolve, so as 
to incorporate thoroughly with the soil, in less than 4 or
5 years; a return too tardy to be waited for, by those-
who had their annual rents to pay.  Only 2 or 3 of
the ablest farmers in the country, who had long, and
easy tacks, ventured to continue, in a certain extent, the
usage of it; other who had come under engagements to
marl 2 or 3 acres, in the course of year, either failed
in the performance, or importuned their landlord for a
relaxation from it *.

*The discovery and proof of the prolife power and quick effect of
lime, especially upon new lands, gave hopes of its being adopted in
place of marl, to the equal contentmentof the proprietors and tenants.
Although the lime was not to be got nearer than from the Berwick kilns,
or those on the other side of the Tweed, both of them at the distance of
10 to 11 miles, yet the quantity of it necessary to an acre being only 10
or 12 cart loads, taken up in shells, which, it well burnt, produced the
double in flack lime, the disadvantage of the carriage appeared to be
compensated.  But still, the purchase-money being added to the car-
ringe of the lime, rendered the expense of both toe heavy for the te-
nants; who, not yet assured of all the benefit of the lime manure, were
not disposed ot engage in it, but upon certain terms, with their mat-
ters.  When lease were entered into between them, a compromise
commonly took place about the lime to be laid upon the lands; a 
fixed quantity of which being carried home by the former, was to be
paid of by the latter.  Much to the advantage of the tenants, who lived
no greater distance from the lime kilns than Chirnfide, as this agree-
ment, the benefit of it was not taken to the extent it might have
