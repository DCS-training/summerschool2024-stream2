sellors and leeting magistrates.  In this first election, the in-
corporated trades have nothing to say; but the deacons of
the first six mentioned trades have a vote in choosing the pro-
vost and the two bailies, which must be done on, or before
Michaelmas day, and two days after the day of election and
leeting; at least there must be one day betwixt the two days.
The convener of the trades is said to be a member of the
town council, ex officio; and as he does not continue in his
office of convener above three years, he must in consequence
leave the council at the expiration of that period.  But it is
competent for the remaining twelve members of the council
to choose themselves every year, if they think proper, as long
as they live, which they commonly do; so that the town-
council of Brechin is in the strictest sense of the word, self-
elected.  A degraded counsellor is a rare phenomenon here.
For the space of 23 years bygone, I only recollect two instan-
ces of the kind.  The corporations and several of the bur-
gesses here, look upon this set or constitution of the borough
as not founded in equity, and for this reason have joined
with others in an application to Parliament for what is called
the Borough Reform, in order to bring back the Royal Bo-
roughs in Scotland to their original constitution, according to
which the body of burgesses were to choose every year, the
members of the town council.

   Ecclesiastical State.- Brechin was a rich and antient bishop-
rick, founded about the year 1150 by David the I. furnam-
ed the Saint, on account of his uncommon liberality to the
church.  The culdees had a convent here at that time.  Their
abbot Leod was witness to the grant made by King David to
his new Abbey of Dunfermline: but where their convent
stood I cannot say, nor do I find any mention of them in
Brechin after this period.
