Antiquities.--At the foot of the Campsie Fells are the traces of
two Caledonian forts, the larger about 100, the smaller about 20
yards in diameter. They are situated about two miles from the
Roman wall, which crosses the country a little beyond the south-east
extremity of this parish. A few Roman urns, and a number of
English coins, of the ages of Elizabeth, James I., and Charles I.,
have been dug up at Birdstone. The latter are conjectured to
have been hid by the inhabitants who were forced to flee from
their houses, by the depredations of Montrose's troops, at the pe-
riod of the battle of Kilsyth.
   Buildings.--The old church at the Clachan bad no architec-
tural beauty, though the situation at the opening of the Kirkton
Glen is very fine. The belfry still stands; and the old bell,
which was deposed for several years, has lately been reinstalled
in its ancient honours, and is again duly rung at funerals, and on
Sunday evenings, when the neigbbourhood assembles in the school-
house for divine service.
   The present parish church, which was erected in 1829, is si-
tuate at Lennoxtown. The style is Gothic, and the building is
handsome and large, being capable of accommodating 1600 per-
sons. The interior is fitted up in a very commodious and supe-
rior manner. Indeed, everything connected with the church re-
flects credit on the liberality of the heritors, who expended on it
nearly L.8000, including the cost of ground, levelling, fencing,
&c. In the tower, at the west end of the church, is a clock pre-
