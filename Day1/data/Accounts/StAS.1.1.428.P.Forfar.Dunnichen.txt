rent, in corn, money, and other articles, in kind.  The farm-
buildings were ruinous hovels; the ground was over-run
with broom, and furz or whins, and many parts of the arable
land were wet and boggy, and all without trees.  It has,
since that time, been drained and inclosed.  Most of the 
muirs, which make a fifth part of the estate, have been
planted with thriving timber.  The sences of many of the
fields are surrounded with hedge-row trees.  The land has
been marled.  The present rents may be fully treble the 
former.  The arable ground now lets, when out of lease,
from L. 1 to L. 1 : 10 : 0 per acre.  The meanest cottager
is now better lodged than the former principal tenants.
Wheat grows well on several of the farms.  There is no
where better flax, turnips, potatoes, and artificial grasses.
There are several different systems of cropping the ground.
The rotation of the best land is oats, flax or fallow for wheat
with dung, barley, and sown down with grass seeds, grass
for the three or four following years.  A second rotation is, 
two crops of oats, a crop of barley, a green crop, a crop of 
oats or barley, with dung, and sown down with grass-seeds,
hay cut one year, and the grass pastured three or four.  Ten
bolls of wheat are raised on an acre, and sixteen stone of 
scuthced flax*.  The inclosed fields are let for 40 or 50 s.
an acre for pasture, and for L.5 and acre for flax.  Compost
dunghills are in general use, with a certain proportion of 
marl, about 8 or 10 bolls to an acre, which is found to an-
swer well; and it is generally now understood that, if fields
are not over-cropt, they cannot be over-marled.  It is diffi-
cult to ascertain accurately the increased produce of an acre,
in consequence of the improved agriculture.  But it is uni-
versally allowed that the farmers were poorer when the rent
