     of Kirkden.

   Manufactures.-There is hardly a house in the parish,
where one or more women are not employed in spinning yarn,
for the Osnaburgh weavers.  Many millions of yards of Osna-
burgh cloth, are, every year made in this county, of which
this parish manufactures its proportion.  The women all spin
with both hands; and a good spinner can earn 3 s, or 3 s 6 d,
per week.  Girls of 13, or 14 years of age, earn, 2 s, and ma-
ny of them 2 s 6 d a week; and they reckon their board only
about 1 s 6 d.  For this reason, many, instead of going to ser-
vice, continue with their parents and friends, merely for the
purpose of spinning, as being a more profitable employment,
and, in which they enjoy more liberty.  But there are many,
who do not like to be so closely confined to spinning, and
therefore go to service, where only a part of their time is
spent at the wheel.  Weavers are interspersed, at small dis-
tances, all over the country; and most of them give out flax,
and pay the current price for spinning it.  Much of the flax
grows at home; but great quantities are also brought from
abroad.  Till lately, the manufacturers of this neighbourhood
went to Forfar or Arbroath, for the stamping and sale of their
webs; but now there is a market, every sortnight, for these
purposes, at the neighbouring village of Letham.

   Population.-On the last day of October 1790, the num-
ber of persons living in the parish of Kirkden, properly pa-
rishioners, were 727; of whom there 359 males, and 
368 females.
