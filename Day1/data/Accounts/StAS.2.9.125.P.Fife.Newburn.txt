  Antiquities.-If we may credit the tradition of a remote period,
the Culdees had a church in this parish. King Malcolm granted
to these priests Balchrystie, where the foundation-stones ofan an-
cient edifice were dug up about half a century ago on the very
spot where the church of the Culdees is supposed to have stood.
  Resident Land-owners.-Four of the land-owners now mention-
ed have mansion-houses in the parish.
