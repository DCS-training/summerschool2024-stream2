had by that time made some progress.  We find the monks
at work in the fields, and heaps of grain in the barn.  We
find some mention made even of fruit trees and orchards;
and of a Saxon, at that time, in Icolumkil, who exercised
the office or trade of abaker.
   Hogs, too, made no small share of the food of those times.
A powerful chieftain in Islay, was entrusted, by the saint,
with the charge of a Pictish Prince, and the monster put his
guest to the sword.  'Before he shall eat of his hogs, said
'the saint, after they shall have fed upon the nuts, he shall
'die.'  This circumstance strongly marks, not only the mode
of living, but also the barbarity of the times.  Theft and
robbery were common; but the modern evil, of spirituous
liquors, seems to have been then unknown.  A leathern bot-
tle, with only innocent milk, is all the beverage allotted to
the failer on his voyage.  The bed was the bare ground, and
a stone the pillow.  No mention is made of money.  A
spear, and not money, is the price paid by the saint, for the
redemption of a slave or captive.  Indeed, in a much later
period, this root of evil had hardly appeared in our barren
mountains.  About the beginning of the 13th century, the
donation of the great Lord of Kintyre and the Isles, to the
abbey of Paisley, as already mentioned, was half a mark;
and, about the same time, a King of Mann provoked a re-
bellion, and lost his throne, by spending 100 marks, which
seem to have been the collected treasure of his kingdom.
   Five or six centuries seem to have made no change in
manners, under the later Kings, or their successors, the Mac-
donalds; as we find the most barbarous punishments inflict-
ed on criminals and prisoners of war such as putting out
their eyes, and depriving them, of some other members.  In
that period, too, dress was not much attended to.  Monu-
ments of the 15th and 16th centuries represent even chief-
