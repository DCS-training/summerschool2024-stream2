the latter 18 miles.  Another originates from the distance of
market towns.  Selkirk is the nearest, and even it is distant
8 miles from the manse.  The bad state of the roads consti-
tutes a third.  It is only of late years that any attention
been paid to them.  Now a communication for carrriag
opened up the Yarrow river, from Selkirk to Moffat and the
west country.  Another road is carried up the Etterick river,
as far as Etterick church; but both these, especially that of

and hardship to the storemasters in the upper district of the
parish.  Frequently they have been obliged to fly to the low
countries for provision for their flocks, and after all their toil
and expence many of them have been cut off.  In the years
1772 and 1774, they sustained immense losses.  Some whole
farms were almost desolated by the mortality among the
sheep, occasioned by the severity of the winters.  The scar-
city of bridges is likewise a great drawback upon this parish.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-No particular manufactures are
carried on in the parish.  Household expences are greatly
increased of late years.  Landed property seldom changes.

acre.  Very little of the parish is inclosed.  The dress of the
inhabitants is much altered from what it was 20 or 30 years
ago.  A spirit for feuing at present prevails among the peo-
ple.  One whole farm belonging to the Duke of Buccleugh
