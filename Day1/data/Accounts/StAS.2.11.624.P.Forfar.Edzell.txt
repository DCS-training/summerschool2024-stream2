  The farms in general are rather of moderate size. Indeed, in
many cases, there are obstructions to enlargement from moor,
moss, and high grounds.  One farm is of 550 imperial acres, one
of 340, seven of 120, eight of 70 odds, four from 108 to 50, ten
from 50 to 30-of arable land, besides about 55 acres held by
twelve tenants at the village of Edzell.
  Seventeen leases yet subsist since 1768, of which it is obvious
the rent per arable acre must now be a tride.  The remaining
farms are let on equitable leases of nineteen years, at from 16s.
to 18s. per imperial acre.
   Arable acres may be stated at 4270.

  The village of Edzell, formerly called Slateford, has undergone
very great improvement within the last three years. In 1839, Lord
Panmure granted building leases of ninety-nine years duration;
and, in consequence, a great many substantial and comfortable
houses have been erected, which are set down according to a re-
gular plan, and must all be built of stone and lime, covered with
slate, and have small flower-plots in front, enclosed by low parapet
walls.  The annual rent of these leases is at the rate of L.8 per
Scotch acre, and the value of the house erected must not be less
than L.40.  The village contains about 300 inhabitants, and has
a sub post-office established in April last with a daily runner from
Brechin.  In the centre of the village, a very handsome building
has been lately erected by Lord Paumure, which is to be occupied
as a post-office and reading-room.  There is also an excellent and
commodious inn in the village, and at the Cannachy Bridge, a mile
further north, there is also a very good inn. The scenery on the
river North Esk, in the immediate vicinity, is very picturesque and
attractive to strangers.  The locality of the village is healthy and
much resorted to for summer lodgings.
  Ecclesiastical State-The church, built eighteen years ago, in
1818, is a roomy, well finished building, and as commodiously si-
tuated as can be for a parish of such a form.  There are 650
sittings: 10 sittings are set apart for the poor.
