Secession, 7 with the Relief, I with the Old Light Burghers, 2
with the Original Seceders, and 1 with the Independents.
	The parish church is remarkably well attended. The general
complaint for a long time has been, that many persons could not
attend for want of room. The average number of communicants
is 360.  *

<FOOTNOTE>*The church of Dunlop belonged in former times to the Abbey of Kilwinning,
the monks enjoying the rectorial tithes, and appointing a vicar for the performance
of the spiritual duties. In Bagimont's Roll, as it stood in the reign of James V., the
vicarage of Dunlop, in the deanery of Cunninghame, was taxed at L. 5, 6s. 8d., being
a tenth of the estimated value. (Caledonia.) It is not known at what time it was
erected into a parochial charge. The earliest notice I find of it is in the chartulary
of Paisley, from which it appears that in 1265, "John de Reston was perpetual vicar
of the parish church of Dunlnp. In 1505, Sir Andrew Marshall, the vicar of Dun-
lop, was chamberlain to the Archbishop of Glasgow, and one of the vicars-general of
the archbishopric. John Major, Professor of Theology in Glasgow, in referred
to, appears to have been vicar of Dunlop from 1518 till 1523. From that period,
till the time of the Reformation, when the vicarage was held by Mr John Houston,
I have not been able to learn any particulars concerning my clerical predecessors.
	Hans Hamilton, son of Hamilton of Raploch, appears to have been the first Pro-
testant minister of this parish. It is stated in the inscription on his tombstone, and
the monument which his son erected to his memory, that he died in l608 after hav-
ing served the cure at this church forty-five years. He must therefore have entered
on this charge in 1563. In the "register of ministers. exhorters, and readers, and of
their stipends after the period of the Reforniation," lately published by the Maitland Club,
there is the following entry with regard to Dunlop: "John Hamilton, vicar and ex-
horter, the thryd of the vicarage extending to xxvi. li. providing be wait on his charge
beltym 1567." The only way I know of reconciling this extract with what was pre-
viously Stated, is by supposing that John Hamilton is the same person with Hans
Hamilton. Hans being only an abbreviation of Johannes. Hans Hamilton was suc-
ceeded in the charge by Hew Eglinton, who died in 1646. As the records of Pres-
bytery during the time of his incumbency are lost, little is known about him. From
an incidental notice in the record of the Presbytery's proceedings at a subsequent
period, it appears that he was under process at the time of his death, but the
cause of the process is not specified. In 1648, two years after the death of
Hew Eglinton, Gabriel Cunninghame was settled. He was ejected in 1663, and
restored again by the indulgence of 1672, when Mr William Mein was associated
with him in the charge of the parish. After this he seems to have fallen under
the suspicion and displeasure of the government, for on the 2d of April 1683, he
was indicted, along with some others, "for aiding, assisting, and corresponding
with Mr John Cunninghame, late of Bedlane, a notorious traitor." Failing to
appear, "he was denounced and put to the horn, and his moveable goods ordered
to be escheat, and brought into his Majesty's use, as an outlaw and a fugitive."
He is mentioned by Wodorw, as having lived till after the Revolution; but whether
he was restored to his charge before that period does not appear. He seems to have
been a person of considerable eminence, and to have taken a prominent part in the de-
liberations of the Presbyterian ministers in those distracted times,--(Wodrow, i. 352,
353, 437, appendix, 75 137: ii. 298, folio edition.) The following is a list of the
ministers of this parish, admitted after the Revolution:
	John Jameson, ordained 21st September 1692, died 1706; James Rowat, ordained
May 1709, translated to Jedburgh September 1732; Robert Baird, ordained 28th
March 1734, died 27th March 1756; James Wodrow, D. D., ordained 1st Septem-
ber 1757 translated to Stevenston, October 1759; John Fullarton, ordained 25th
September 1760, translated to Dalry, 16th March 1762; John Graham. ordained
12th May l763, translated to Kirkinner, 30th June l779; Thomas Brishane, ordain-
ed 27th April 1780, died 9th May 1837; Matthew Dickie, admitted from Limerick,
8th May 1834, assistant and successor.
	The writer of this account has to acknowledge his obligations to James Dobie, Esq.
Beith. for supplying him with most of the particulars respecting the ancient state of
the parish, wbich are incidentally mentioned.
