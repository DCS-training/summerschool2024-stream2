chalders of victual.  The church was built in 1739; the manse
is an old building, frequently wanting repairs.  The Earl of

   Poor.-The number of poor who receive alms from the
parish is 48, which is a much smaller number than usual.
The funds that support them arise from the collections at
the church doors, fees for proclamation of banns, and for the

necessitous persons, and the want of the interest of the L. 200,
