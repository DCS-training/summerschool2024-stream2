by weight.  The Banffshire firlot is 32 Scotch standard
pints, and the medium of a boll of oats of said measure
is 14 stone Amsterdam weight; of barley 18 stone:  bar-
ley, however, is often much above that; 19 1/2 and even 20
stone:  and oats often yeild 8 stone of meal, besides paying
mill dues.

   Gultivation.-The most part of this parish is arable, and
has been, at one time or other, under the plough.  The
lands on the river side have been, for some time past, in
a state of improvement.  The tenants, stimulated by the
example set before them by the heritors, the late and pre-
sent Lord Banff, and Captain Hay, when he resided at
Carnousie, in improving their mains, had made rapid pro-
gress in cultivation.  And now the same spirit has caught
some young farmers, and even the old are stirring, and
extending the like improvements over the rest of the pa-
rish.  In the remotest parts of the parish, we have now
as good husbandry, fields as well dressed, and as good
grain, grass, and turnip raised, as on the river side.  The
principal tenants have been in the practice of sowing tur- 
nip in broad-cast chieftly, for the space of 18 or 20 years;
and now the smaller ones have each their proportion of
them, and of sown grass, which they find much for their
profit, and is much in favour of the brute creation.-The 
mains, in the hands of the heritors, are of considerable
extent, and well improved.  There are only two large
farms in the parish; the farm of Old-Town of Carnousie,
of about 100 L. Sterling rent, and the farms of Kirktown
and Eastside, presently conjoined, of about 60 L.:  the rest,
at a medium, rent from 20 L. to 30 L.  There are a good
many crofts for the accommodation of the servants and 
labourers employed by the heritors.
