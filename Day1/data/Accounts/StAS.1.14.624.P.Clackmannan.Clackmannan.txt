was supposed to yield 15 gallons of spirits, and duty was
charged accordingly; but instead of 15, 20 gallons of spirits
were often drawn form the 100 of wash.  In Scotland, the
surplus above 15 gallons was uniformly seized, as spirits
presumed to be fraudulently obtained; while in England
the distiller was allowed the full exercise of his genius,
and got permits for the removal of his actual produce.  At
this period, the quantum of duty on a gallon of spirits
was more than double of what it has ever been since.
But the high rate of duty afforded such temptation to
smuggling, that the consumption of spirits in Scotland
was chiefly supplied by the manufacture of illegal stills,
and by smuggling from abroad.  Great distillers could not
smuggle; and being continually subjected to the surveys
of the excise, the two distilleries of Kilbagie and Ken-
netpans depended entirely on the London market for the 
sale of their produce; where, previous to the year 1784,
they carried on an advantageous trade; though the duty
on a gallon of spirits in England was 13 2/3 pence higher than
in Scotland; and though they had, at shipping their spirits
for England, to pay down this difference on every gallon
shipped.  In 1784, a law was passed, rendering the duties,
and mode of levying them, the same both in Scotland as in
England; and at the same time reducing the rate of duty
each gallon about one half of what it had been formerly;
while it allowed the manufacturer a credit for 20 gallons
of spirits from the 100 gallons of wash, and granted per-
mits accordingly.  The London distillers expected, that
by this equalization plan, the Scotch could not continue
their trade to London, and Pay the duties in the same
manner with themselves.  But in this they were mistaken;
for the trade increased.  And it is the opinion of the best
informed distillers, that the London distillers are not a
