plains and extensive woods along its coasts, contrasted with
the splendid grandeur of its surrounding mountains, have at-
tracted the attention of all travellers of taste, and of none
more than the elegant describer of the sublime and beautiful.
Nor are the inhabitants of this country deficient in genius or
industry.  Surmounting the difficulties of situation, more of
them, than perhaps of any district of equal population in Scot-
land, have brought themselves forward into notice and conse-
quence; and appear, with credit to themselves and with ad-
vantage to others, in the learned professions, as well as in the
commercial, the military, and the naval departments.  To a
people to whom nature has been so kind, it is a pity that are
should not lend its assistance.  They have long envied those,
who, by means of navigable canals, came to the enjoyment of
advantages which were formerly denied them.  The distance
however of Lochow from the sea, and the expence attending
a junction of them, prevented the inhabitants of this country
almost from communicating their wishes on this subject to
each other, much more from laying a plan of a Lochow Ca-
nal before the public.  But, now that a subscription has been
completed for a canal from Crinan to Lochgilphead, which
brings the communication with the sea nearer to Lochow;
what might formerly be looked upon as a visionary plan, be-
comes now, not only practicable, but an object highly expe-
dient.
   It appears, from the returned estimates of an engineer em-
ployed by the landed proprietors of the country, that a pas-
sage may be made, from the Crinan Canal to Lochow, to ad-
mit flat-built vessels from 50 to 60 tons burthen,
     By one tract, 6 feet deep, for 11,255 L. 15 s. 6 1/2 d.
     By another, 6 feet deep, for 11,642 L. 7 s. 10 1/2 d.
     By another, 6 feet deep, for 19,203 L. 6 s. 8 1/2 d.
     By another, 4 feet deep, for 10,568 L. 3 s.
