   As to the births, notwithstanding every attention of the
session, parents too frequently neglect the registration of their
children's names, especially when they die in early infancy.
Besides, there are a few families of Nonjurants in the parish,
who never enter their births in the register.  To render
the average just, therefore, the sum of 5 or 6 may be annual-
ly added to the births.
   With regard to the marriages, it is believed that the table
is sufficiently accurate.
   As to the deaths, a difficulty almost insurmountable oc-
curs.  It has been an immemorial custom to use the mort-
cloth or pall only for persons above 10 years of age; and
those burials alone are recorded, as they produce a tax to the
poor.  Paupers, too, being exempted from this tax, are not
enrolled in the register of burials.
   An attempt has been made to supply these deficiencies in
the register by calculation.  Of children born, it is generally
allowed that more than one half die before the age of 10
years.  In order, however, to be within bounds, and making
allowance for the healthiness of the climate, the deaths under
10 have been stated only at one half of the children born.
   For the unregistered deaths of paupers, the annual average
of 2 has been taken, as approaching nearly to the truth.
