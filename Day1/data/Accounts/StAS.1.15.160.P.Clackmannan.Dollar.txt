greatest part of the parish, following the same system of
farming, that had been handed down to them by their fa-
thers. What indeed proved an insurmountable bar to im-
provement, was, the lands of different proprietors lying
interspersed with one another, commonly called run-rig,
which was a case that very much prevailed through many
parts of Scotland; but it is now hardly known in this part of
the country.  About 16 years ago, a very considerable part of
the best lands in the parish, which lay in that state, were di-
vided; when the different proprietors got their respective
proportions of ground laid together, each by itself.  This has
been productive of several very desirable consequences;
such as, cutting off endless quarrels and disputes, that were
continually taking place between the different proprietors, or
their tenants, about their encroaching or trespassing upon
one another; and so establishing peace and harmony amongst
neighbours, instead of strife and variance.  It has also open-
ed up a door to improvements of every kind. For, immedia-
tely upon the ground being divided, the different proprie-
tors inclosed and sub-divided, with ditch and hedge, their re-
spective proportions of land. And the several inclosures are
now alternately under oats, barley, hay, pasture, etc.  to the
no small benefit of the proprietors, and the pleasure of the
traveller.  Some late purchasers are carrying on very consi-
derable improvements in the modern style; the agreeable and
beneficial effects of which are daily appearing.

   Minerals.-This part of the country abounds in coal, of
different qualities.  Three coal-works are going on at pre-
sent in this parish; two upon the South side of the Dovan;
the one at Mellack, the property of the Duke of ARGYLL; the
other closely adjoining to it, but belonging to Lord ALVA.
