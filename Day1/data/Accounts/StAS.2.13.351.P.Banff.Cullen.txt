transferred from Banff, 1806.  The above Societies were instituted
for the purpose of relieving sick and indigent brethren, their wi-
dows and children. They were all dissolved in 1832, in conse                       .-
quence of an Act of Parliament passed, or about to be passed, at
that time, respecting the funds of Friendly Societies.  The Mason
Lodge was remodelled in 1835.  It consists at present of from
60 to 70 members, and has a disposable fund of about L. 100.
This Society, previous to its dissolution in 1832, numbered 270
members.
  Poor and Poor's Funds.-The average number of persons re-
gularly receiving parochial aid is 87, viz. 71 in Cullen proper,
and 16 in the annexation.  The distributions are made quarterly;
intermediate aid being advanced occasionally, in case of urgent
necessity.  The average sum aliotted to each person per annum
is, in Cullen proper, 15s. 41/2d., and in the annexation, 14s. 3d,
The average annual amount of monies, for the last seven years,
available for behoof of the poor, and under the management of
the kirk-session, is L.76, 14s.  IO1/2d., arising from the following
sources, viz. church collections, L.59, 4s. 6d. ; interest of funds,
L.6, 9s. 4d.; dues on proclamations of banns, L.1, 18s. 11d.;
hire of morteloth, L.1, 6s. 9 1/4d.; mortification, L.2, 2s.; penalties,
L.5, 13s. 4 1/4d.  The average annual expenditure, for the same
period, is L.78, 13s. 8d., viz. quarterly distributions, L.66, 6s. 2 1/2d.;
occasional aid, L.4, 15s.; officers fees, and other expenses,
L.7, 12s. 51/2d. There never has been an assessment for the sup-
port of the poor; the voluntary contributions of the community,
together with the items above stated, having hitherto proved suf-
ficient for affording the usual rate of aliment.
   Bede-House.-There formerly existed in the parish a bede-
house, or hospital, for the maintenance of a limited number of
decayed persons, the origin of which cannot now be precisely de-
termined.  It appears to have been founded by the Findlater fa-
mily, and its name\f* marks it as an institution of Popish times,

<FOOTNOTE>Bede, in Saxon, prayer; bede men, who joined in the celebration of masses for
the dead.  The writer has gleaned the following traditinary notices regarding the
Bede House of Cullen, which may be relied on as substantially correct. The lands
of Upper Pattenbringan and Brunton were mortified, for the support of eight de-
cayed farmers, and eight farmers' widows.  A house of two storeys was built for
them in Cullen; each flat divided into eight sleeping apartments and, ia kitchen.
The men occupied the lower, and the women the upper flat.  The men had two peeks
of oatmeal,and the women one and a-balf ditto each por week.  From Pattenblingan
and Brunton, week about, the were supplied with milk in summer, and beef in
