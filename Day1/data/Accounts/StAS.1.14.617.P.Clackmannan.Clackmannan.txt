and 538 new plantations, all in a thriving state, and some
of them nerly ready for cutting.  There are upwards of
20 acres of moss in the parish, and 70 acres of land from
which the moss has been removed, now under pasture and
bay.  A cold clay soil, with a wet bottom, predominates
over a very great part of the parish; some of it so poor
indeed as not to be worth the labouring.  A few spots
however of a light dry soil, and even of a rich black loam,
with a fine bottom, are to be found here and there.  Part
of the land in the neighbourhood of the village is of this
quality and accordingly the rent of it is proportionably
high.  But the richest and largest track of land lies on the
banks of the river Forth, consisting of 1000 acres of ex-
cellent carse soil, all very fertile.  From this, it will easily
appear, that the rent of the land must be very much va-
ried, according to its quality; rising from almost nothing,
to 43 s. the acre.  The real rent of the parish is 4700 l,.
Sterling, and is approaching towards 5000 l., as the pre-
sent leases expire.  The valued rent is 9155 l. 17 l. 4 d.
Scotch; which probably was the real rent at the time of
the valuation.

   State of Agriculture, etc.-The agriculture of this parish
has undergone a very great change during these last 15
years.  Many of the farms have been greatly enlarged*,
which has enabled the tenant to adopt every new im-
provement.  The success of one has induced others to fol-
low the example:  and at this time, almost all the farmers

*At present, there are about forty farms fewer in the parish than
were about twenty years ago.  Some of the farmers now possess farms to
the extent of 700 acres; besides having what are called led farms, in the
adjoining parishes, to a very great extent.  From this, it may be the opi-
nion of some persons, that several of the farms in this parish are too
large, while others are undoubtedly too small.
