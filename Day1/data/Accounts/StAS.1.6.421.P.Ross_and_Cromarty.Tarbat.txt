manure.  They were tried, but the trial not succeeding, pro-
bably through a failure in the management, a second attempt
has not yet been made.-At the bottom of some of the mosses,
marle has been discovered.  That found at a place called.
Merkle Tarrel is of the richest quality, and has been used for
some years past by the farmer there, much to his advantage.
Mr. Macleod of Geanies has also considerable quantities of
rock and pit marle on different parts of his property.  In two
farms, some of the fields lie on a stratum of stone of a red co-
lour, which when dug up, is soon dissolved by the fun and
weather, and when spread on the ground, is found to have
a powerful effect in meliorating the soil and crops.-On a
few of the farms, oats are the principal crop, pease were sown
in large quantities, and the returns were profitable, but that
part of the crop has now failed for many years.  Potatoes
have happily come to supply the deficiency.  There is not
a farm, or small cro't, a part of which is not laid out in
cultivating this useful root.  It would be difficult, to ascer-
tain the extent of ground employed for this purpose, or the
quantities raised yearly, but both must be very considerable,
as they are used in every family, and constitute the principal
support of some of them, during nine months of the year.
   The sowing of grass and turnip feeds, is another improve-
ment in agriculture which begins to take place in the parish.
Mr. Macleod of Geanies set also the example in this, by lay-
ing large fields under green crops.  Having his ground inclo-
sed gives him great advantage for this, and every other improve-
ment in farming; but the farmers have become sensible of the
benefit of sowing grass in the open fields; and of late, consider-
able quantities of clover and rye-grass have been laid down in
this manner, which there is reason to think will become a more
general practice.
