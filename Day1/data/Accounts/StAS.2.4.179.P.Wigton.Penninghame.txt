building, in the village of Newtonstewart, affording by no means
suitable accommodation.
	Penninghame House, the residence of James Blair, Esq. is
about four miles north of Newstonstewart, on the border of the
river Cree, as already mentioned.--Merton Hall, belonging to
Edward Boyd, Esq. is about two miles from Newstonstewart, near
the road to Glenluce.--Corsbie, belongoing to the Earl of Gal-
loway, is very ner Newstonstewart; and Corrisel, belonging to
road to Wigton.
	There are two mills for grain in the parish, but no manufactory.
	There is a town-hall in Newtonstewart, and under it a lock-up-
house, for the temporary confinement of those who transgress the
laws. The buildings here specified are all of stone, blue or whin-
stone (trap), and the rybats, lintels, &c. of granite or freestone.
The wood used in building is generally American red or yellow
pine; and in some of the older houses it is from the Baltic.
Larch and other firs are used in farm-steadings occasionally, but
not in houses of any considerable size.

			III.--POPULATION.

	The population in 1755 was				1509
			  1791					2260
			  1801					2569
			  1811					2847
			  1821					3090
			  1831	Males, 1638; females, 1823;	3461

	The population of Penninghame was much increased by the esta-
blishment of a cotton-mill in the end of the last century; and it has
continued to be increased by the demand for labourers in the pro-
gress of agricultural improvememnt. Many families from Ireland,
travelling in quest of work, on getting temporary employment, fre-
quently settle here. We have had some emigration of late years,
but not so extensive as to affect perceptibly the amount of popula-
tion. The persons emigrating have not been generally of the
poorest class.

							Census 1831,	3461
Yearly average of marriages for the last seven years,			 224

No record of deaths.
	The preceding is the number of births registered, but some
Dissenters do not register their children in the parish records,
and therefore the average marked must be under the real number.
