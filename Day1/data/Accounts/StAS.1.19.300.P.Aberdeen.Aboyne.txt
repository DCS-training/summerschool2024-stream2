impracticable.  And from the great extent of waste or un-
improved land, on which a very small quantity of lime
would operate, they would soon be indemnified by the rise
of their rents for the expence of any canal which was con-
ducted on rational principles.  In the parish of Aboyne, in
particular, from the rise of both the rent of the lands, and
of the price of wood a canal to Aberdeen would be at-
tended with most beneficial effects.

   Soil and Agriculture.-Much cannot be said in behalf of
either of these.  The soil of both parishes is sandy or gra-
velly.  In some parts it is loamy, but very little of a clay
soil is found in either of there parishes.  In rainy seasons
abundant crops are produced; but it has long been obser-
ved, that Dee-side needs a shower every 24 hours, from
May to August.  And in very dry seasons, from the qua-
lity and thinness of the soil, this district is very deficient
both in corn and straw.  Harvests, of course, are earlier
than in most parts of the county.  When the soil of the
lands adjacent to the two principal rivers of Aberdeenshire,
the Dee and Don, are compared, the latter has manifestly
the advantage on the whole.  Hence the old rhyme,

     A foot of Don's worth two of Dee,
     Except it be for fish and tree.

   The inhabitants of this parish, however, by selling their
wood, in more distant parts of the county, at high prices,
contrive to live comfortably.  At the same time, it must
be confessed, that this traffic in wood is a loss to agricul-
ture; and since the introduction of the new husbandry, this
district, which is admirably adapted for raising barley, tur-
nips and potatoes, receives yearly a considerable quantity
of lime, which goes a great way in the thin soil of this di-
