house.  In stormy weather, during the winter-season, they 
must have besides, at the lowest calculation, one peck of 
grain a-day, to preserve their lives, and keep them at 
home.  They begin, and continue to lay and hatch from 
the middle of March to the middle or end of June; and 
from Lammas to the 1st of November.  The annual pro- 
duce of each may be reckoned at 150 pairs, at 2 d. a-pair, 
and 16 s. for the dung.  There is a well attested instance 
of 160 pairs being taken from the pigeon-house of Nether 
Buckie, at one harrying; the usual run is about 30 pairs. 
Numbers of pigeons come from the inland country in the 
beginning of August to the dovecots in this parish, and 
remain in the till November, when they retire to their 
original place of residence.  Jays are the greatest enemies 
to the pigeon-houses.  In times of scarcity, they enter 
them and destroy the young; the old ones are not unfre-
quently a prey to hawks, and other ravenous birds. 

   Plantations.-These have been already mentioned, as ly-
ing chiefly in the east end of the parish.  Lord Findlater 
has paid great attention to planting.  His plantations are 
of considerable extent, and in a thriving state.  At first 
they were mostly planted with Scotch firs; but have since 
been filled up with oaks, elm, ashes, beeches, birches, 
larches, etc.  They beautify and enliven the landscape; 
and the annual thinnings soon reimburse his Lordship, and 
are serviceable in building cottages, and for fuel.  His dif-
ferent plantations amount to               -        4300 acres.
