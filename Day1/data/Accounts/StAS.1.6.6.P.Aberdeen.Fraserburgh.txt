parish not only supplied itself with provisions, but annually
exports a large quantity of barley, oats, meal, beans, and
potatoes, of the best kind.
   The improvements are, in a great measure, to be ascribed
to the heritors, who, desirous of promoting the interest and
happiness of their tenants, have bound the latter to inclose
their farms, and to build good houses; and, for their encou-
ragement, have either given immediate pecuniary assistance,
and deductions of rent for a limited time, or engaged for cer-

ceased, and of consequence, an equally regular rotation of
cropping ground has not taken place; nor are the habitations
of all the farmers well constructed and convenient.  It cannot
be expected that people should depart, all at once, from esta-

by degrees; but the spirit of industry, which has begun to o-

overcome former prejudices, especially when the means of
improvement are at hand.  An inexhaustible shore of very
fine shell-sand and sea-ware, are on the side of the parish,
and lime is on the other:  All these are much used in manuring
the ground, and found very prositable in raising crops.-
Many cattle are reared in the parish, and some fattened and

farmers now using only two in a plough instead of six or eight,
as was customary; and oxen are again, of late, more gene-
rally employed in doing the work on the farm.  A few years
ago, there was scarcely a farmer who had not a flock of sheep;
