it can be calculated, it may amount to upwards of 5000 L.
a-year.  Within the last 20 years, the rents have risen above
2000 L. a-year;  and they are daily advancing.  The rent of
land, let in large farms, is from 10 s. to 22 s. the acre.  Small
pieces of ground, if of superior quality, or in the immediate
neighbourhood of the villages, will bring from 30 s. to 40 s.
the acre.

rye-grass.  More attention is paid to following, and cleaning;
and more judgment shown in cropping the lands.  The ju-

and less in tillage than formerly; by these means, as well as
by the quantity of turnips raised, and consumed upon his farm,
the quantity of manure is increased, and he enabled, to do
