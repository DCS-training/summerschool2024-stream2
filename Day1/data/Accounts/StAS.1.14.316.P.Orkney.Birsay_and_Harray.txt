     Statistical Account

and, by the best accounts we have had from them, the
shoals of Marwick are 16 fathom; the S. head 14 fa-
thom; and the rim shoals deepens from 20 to 40 fa-
thom, or upwards, until they come to the N. head,
which is only about 10 feet, all at low water.  I have
been upon these shoals several times; and I have good
reason to believe, that what the fishermen say is true.
No light-house is erected, and we think one could be of

boats; one in Marwick, which contains 3, but it is on-
ly a summer habitation; for except they had Castragoe
under lee, they could not keep a boat in Marwick or
the S. side.

   Mountains, etc.-There are no remarkable mountains
in this parish; and as to hills, I never took the height
of them by any proper mensuration, nor do I think
them worth pains, because I really believe the barome-
ter and thermometer would make them of but little
height; they are nothing like Hoy:  They are covered
with heath, and what we call lubba, a sort of grass
which feeds our cattle in the summer time; it generally
consists of different species of carices, plain bent, and
other moor grasses.  No volcanic appearances, nor any fi-
gured stones, are to be seen in this parish; nor any have
fossil, marine bodies, or any petrified parts of animals,
yet been observed.  There are indeed some springs,
which throw up a species of lime, of no determined
