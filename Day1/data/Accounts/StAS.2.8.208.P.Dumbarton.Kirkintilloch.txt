boundaries of the new parish are as follows: From the bridge
leading from Campsie on the north, along the coal-road, and then
up the High Street to the Cross; thence along the Cowgate and
down the Broadcroft to the river Luggie, and by it to the canal;
then across the canal by the Hillhead-bridge, onward by the
Longmuir road to the Twechar road; then up the Bord-burn
and onward to the Moss-water; it is then bounded on the east
and north by the parishes of Cumbernauld, Kilsyth, and Camp-
sie. It contains a population of about 2700 souls; a number suf-
ficient for the strongest man's superintendence.
   Education.--The instruction at the parochial school consists
of English, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, mathematics, geo-
graphy, Latin, Greek, and Freneh. The present very able and
efficient teacher is the Rev. Andrew Love, a licentiate of the
Church of Scotland. The salary is L. 34, 4s. 4 1/2d. paid by 144
heritors. The average wages may be about L. 30; other emolu-
ments about L. 4. The Rev. Mr Love informs me, that his ave-
rage number of scholars, summer and winter, falls little short of 124.
There is also a subscription school, taught by Mr Hendry, and
another with a remarkably elegant fabricat Gartshore,taught by Rev.
Mr Donald, which is upon a charitable foundation, and was erected
by the munificence of a lady of the family of Gartshore. There
are, in all, nine schools in the parish, one parochial school, as above,
two endowed schools, and the rest unendowed. In 1833, the num-
bers and ages of those attending school were as follows: numbers
of children taught to read under five years of age, 2; five to fifteen,
years of age, 480; to write, from five to fifteen years of age; 199
children at parochial school, from Lady-Day to Michaelmas,
124; children at schools not parochial, from Lady-Day to Michael-
mas, 522; from Michaelmas to Lady-Day, 545.
   The number of children under twelve years of age attending
school in tbe various districts of the parish in 1837, according to
the Church Commission Returns is, Barr, 321 ; Shirva, 11;
High Street, north side, 53 ; West High Street, south side,
19; Hillhead, 49; Waterside, 31; Gartshore, 28; Middle-
muir, ll; Cowgate, 102; Townhead, 109; omitted in Town-
head,2; Gallowhills,8; Cordalet, Bellfield, &c. 18, total 472. The
total number of scholars, as far as can be ascertained, may be in all 669,
of whom 472 are under twelve years of age, which is at the rate of
9 6/1 3/6 6/9ths of the whole population. Children twelve years of age and up-
