and another on the first Monday of November annually, for
fixing the quantum of the poor's rates, admitting pensioners,
and granting them annuities, according to their necessities.
There have been no beggars in the parish since the establish-
ment of a poor's rate.  The pensioners on the heritor's list
are all house-holders, and receive from 2 l. to 3 l. Sterling
per annum.  They have a fund of 325 l. Sterling at interest,
which is annually increasing; and it is probable, that, a few
years hence, it will not be necessary to continue the parochial
assessment.  The one half of the weekly collections in the
church, after paying the salaries of the session-clerk and kirk
officer, is appropriated to the supply of the poor who are not
inrolled.
