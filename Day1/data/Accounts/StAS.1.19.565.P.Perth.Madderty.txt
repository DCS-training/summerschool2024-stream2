of agricultural improvements.  Something, however, has
been done in the melioration of the soil, and in the system
of cropping.  Lime and marl have been tried with success;
and the sowing of grasses has been attended with great pro-
fit to the husbandman.  Farms, in general, are small, gi-
ving from L. 15 to L. 50 Sterling a-year.  The largest in
the parish pays L. 90 Sterling a-year.  Although almost
wholly arable, yet very little of the parish is inclosed; a cir-
cumstance which is attended with much inconveniency and
loss.  More grain is produced than is necessary for the use
of the inhabitants.  The common Scotch plough, with two
horses without a driver, is lately got into practice.  Ploughs
of Mr Small's construction have also been introduced.  The
land, in some places, contains great numbers of sit-fast
stones, which prove to be great obstructions to its improve-
ment.  The Rev. Mr Ramsay, the present incumbent, who
occupies a piece of land full of these stones, constructed a
machine for the purpose of raising them.  It operates on
the principles of the pully and cylinder, or wheel and axis,
and has a power as 1 to 24.  It is extremely simple, being
a triangle, to two sides of which the cylinder is fixed.  It
can be easily wrought and carried from place to place by
three men.  A low four-wheeled machine, of a strong con-
struction, is made to go under the arms of the triangle, to
receive the stone when raised up.  This machine has been
already of great use in clearing several fields of large stones
in this place and neighbourhood.

   Abbey of Inch-effray.-This religious house was founded
in the year 1200 by Gilbert Earl of Strathearn, and his
Countess Matilda.  It was dedicated to the honour of God,
the Virgin Mary, and John the Apostle and Evangelist.
The site of this famous Abbey is on a small rising ground,
which seems, from its situation and name, to have once
