   Ancient Population and State.-From the end of the last
century to the middle of the present, the population of this
parish was about one fourth greater than now.  The country
was also filled with the cattle of 17 ploughs, 10 and 12 to
the plough, and covered with above 2000 sheep.  From
about the war 1740, the population has declined to the year
1786.  The cattle were reduced, rapidly near the last period,
to scarce one plough; and there remained not one sheep.
The causes of this depopulation seem to have been these:

fuel to Aberdeen stopped.  The new mode of agriculture
contributed here to the same general effect.  The tenants
found, with the ideas of inclosing and green crops, their
sheep disturbed; and they put flocks of them away.  The
prospect of a division of the parish, which almost wholly lay
in run ridge, and the short, uncertain leases in view to it,
led them to put away the remainder, to give up their oxen,
and to plough on their fields with horses, deprived of the
dung of cattle and sheep, the wet grounds being turned low,
or neglected.

   Division of the Parish, and Improvements.-From the abbacy
of Arbroath, to which this parish belonged, one half of it,
alternate ridge, came to a predecessor of Mr John Menzies
of Pitfoddels, who now possesses it.  The town of Aberdeen
holds the other half, purchased with monies mortified prin-

That community has also some property, which had remain-

was divided in 1786, the town of Aberdeen obtaining the
