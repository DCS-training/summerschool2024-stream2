     Statistical Account

   Number of Acres and Rent.  Without a particular measure-
ment, it is impossible to give the exact number of acres in the
parish.  From the general maps, the sum total is reckoned
to be about 130,000 Scots acres; and, of there, not above
4000 are at present under tillage.  The valued rent is
L. 4204 : 18 : 8.  This sum bears a very small proprotion to
the real rent, which it is easy to give, because it is con-
stantly rising.

   Number of Horses.  Some think, there may about 1000
horses, large and small, in the parish still.  Before the intro-
duction of sheep farms, and the keeping of distinct marches,
a number of the common people had small horses in the hills,
all the year round, excepting in the time of deep snow, when
their owners brought them home, and helped them with fod-
der.  At a certain time of the year, each caught and marked
his own, and broke them for his own use, or sold such as
were fit for work, except the breeding mares.  During the rest
of the year, they ranged, where they pleased, throught the
hills.  As they cannot do this any longer, they are almost ex-
tirpated, and the price of horses has risen beyond all bounds.

   Number of Sheep and Black Cattle.-Formerly, almost every
tenant had a small number of sheep; at present, many of them
have none.  There are now, in the parish, 4 considerable
stocks of sheep; two of them belonging to the principal
heritors; but the others to sheep farmers.  They consist of
from 1000 to upwards of 2000 sheep each; which, added to
what the tenants have, according to the old method, may a-
mount to upwards of 16,000 sheep in all.  The number of black
cattle may be from 2000 to 3000.  The goats are almost
gone.
