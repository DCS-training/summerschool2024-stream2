end of the year, it is added to the funds of the Charity-house.
This house was built by subscription in 1756, and is fit to re-
ceive 60 persons; but, as many pensioners prefer a small week-
ly allowance out of the house, there are seldom more than 
40 in it.  Alderman Smith of Londonderry, born at Air, left
L. 100, several years ago, to purchase land for poor house-
keepers.  This charity has proved very seasonable.  Provost
Cochrane of Glasgow, born and educated at Air, left like-
wise L. 100, the interest of which appointed to be given to 
a reputable burges's widow or daughter during life.  An in-
firmary and bridewell are much wanted.

and a greater quantity of potatoes, half a cart of coals, and
soap to the value of 2 d. per week; 3 stone of wool, at 7 s. 6 d.
