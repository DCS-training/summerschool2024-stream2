no other singularity, but the slow drawling manner in
which it is spoken, and that they uniformly pronounce
fow, fai-w, and mow, mai-w.  The only custom which
they may be said to retain is that of having great and ex-

nor be attended with bad effects ; for few will be inclined
to keep them, where little business and little profits are to
