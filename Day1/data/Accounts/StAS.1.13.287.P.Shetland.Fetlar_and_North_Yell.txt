appoint them to a certain spot in the parish, where they
are maintained; the session clothes them, and when they
die, defray the expense of their burial.  The present in-
cumbent has stipend of L. 64.  The kirks have been
lately newly built, and the manse, though an old one, is
in tolerable good repair; it was built 37 years ago by the
present incumbent out of the vacant stipend, and he ima-
gines it will serve all his lifetime, as he is now 66 years of
age, 38 of which he has been minister in this very fatiguing
charge.  We have few regular bred artificers here; the
people are all of a mechanical turn; we have 3 smiths in

They are in general very quick in comprehending any
branch of literature, or mechanical employments which
they apply to.  But their great misfortune seems to be this,
that they never will have the patience to apply so long to
any one employment as to become proficients in their pro-
fession.  I speak here of the commons; for with respect to
the gentlemen, it is believed there is no part in the king-
dom, where genius is more displayed, or who make greater
progress in academical literature, and in the polite arts,
which they apply to.  The people in general are very
hospitable to strangers.  We have here three gentlemen in
the medical line, who are very eminent in their profession.

   Manufactures and Trade.-Manufactures we have none.
We have tried the line-manufacture of late, but it did
not succeed, for which many reasons may be assigned.  1st,
The fair sex here are so accustomed to roam about among
the rocks in their earliest moments, (while they are pro-
curing bait for the fishing), that they cannot apply with
that diligence that the manufacturing business requires, had
they time to do it, as they really have not.  2d, Constant
