strict.  The application of lime, however, to this soil, should
only be for turnips, potatoes, or bear sown out with grass.
Yet the farmers do sometimes apply it to successive crops
of oats; a mode of farming which, if not speedily checked,
must soon reduce the soil of Dee-side to a caput mortuum.
Though, among the farmers in general, there is no rotation
of crops, nor approved method of husbandry, yet the Earl
of Aboyne's personal farm is in very high cultivation.  It
consists of nearly 400 acres, all inclosed by excellent stone
fences, lined with hedge-rows, and alternately producing
white and green crops; and it proves what can be done,
even on Dee-side, by the proper application of soil, manure,
and good ploughing.

   Population, etc.-The number of inhabitants is 1050.
In 1755, by Dr Webster's account, they were 1695.  There
are four heritors, viz.  The Earl of Aboyne, who is patron,
and generally resides in the parish, Mr Jones of Balnacraig,
Mr Farquharson of Finzean, and the Earl of Aberdeen.
The two last have only a small farm each.  The Earl of
Aboyne is proprietor of five-sixths of the parish.  The
whole land-rent is about L. 1200.

   Burgh of Barony.-Charlestown of Aboyne is a pleasant
little town, and a burgh of barony.  It had once a weekly
market.  It still has four fairs or yearly markets.

   Goat-whey Quarters.-In the parish of Glentanar a great
many goats are kept, and persons afflicted with consump-
tions frequently resort to goat-whey quarters in that parish.
Goatmilk is sold from 4 d. to 6 d. per pint.  It is also made
into cheese; and is much esteemed by connoisseurs.
