   Lochmaben Barony, or Four Towns.-Contiguous to the
Castlemains lies Lochmaben Barony, or, as it is more com-
monly called, the Four Towns, a very large tract of rich fer-
tile land on the banks of the Annan.  The tenants hold their
land by a very singular and peculiar tenure.-They are com-
monly called the King's kindly tenants.  The original pos-
sessors were the garrison of the Castle, to whom the lands
were granted for their attendance on the duties of the garri-
son, or, as some say, the domestic servants of the castle.
There are three kinds of tenure of lands in Scotland,
First, The feudal, which prevails over all Scotland, and
indeed over Europe, in different modifications, according
to the different laws and constitutions of the countries
where it prevails.  Secondly, the Allodial, which, in the Ger-
man language, signifies free, without paying any quit rent, or
having a superior; and, Thirdly, the Udal, being a right com-
pleat without writing; this obtains in Orkney and Zet-
land, and in the holdings of the Four Towns in the Parish
of Lochmaben.  As to the two first, antiquarians and law-
yers may investigate them; with respect to the last, the lands
of Four Towns were granted by one of our kings to his
household servants, or garrison of the Castle, and the pro-
perty of each being small, they were allowed, as a kind of
indulgence, to hold it without the necessary of charter and
bare possession being a sufficient title.  The tenants pay a
small rent to the Viscount of Stormont, but have no charter
or from him.  The property of these lands is trans-
ferred from one person to another, by delivery and possession
only; but they must be entered in the rental in Lord Stor-
mont's rental-book, which is done without fee or reward.
The tenants right was renewed by James VI. and Charles II.
confirmed by the Court of Session, and by a decree of the
British House of Peers, the 28th December 1726, and 14th
