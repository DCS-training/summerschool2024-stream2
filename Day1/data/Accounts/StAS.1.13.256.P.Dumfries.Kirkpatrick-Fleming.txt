     Statistical Account

   The above table, though containing a pretty accurate
statement of the extent of the present cultivation and pro-
duce of the parish, must by no means be regarded as a stan-
dard for future years, as annually large fields of land are
taking in, and that which hath already been in tillage, is
continually rising into higher degrees of cultivation.

   Stock.-The number of stock kept in this district, is on-
ly small in proportion to its extent, owing to the large
quantity of moss, and the little attention which hath hi-
therto been paid to the improvement of pasture-grounds.
There is reason, however, to hope, that more atten-
tion will, in future, be turned to this object, which
doubtless would be an essential benefit to the public,
and could not fail liberally to repay both the proprietor
and tenant.  The black cattle, excepting the cows kept
by one of the principal heritors, and a few others, are
mostly of the Galloway breed.  They are esteemed more
hardy and firm, agree better with the pasture, and in ge-

*The only measure now used in the parish of Kirkpatrick-Fleming,
and over the greatest part of Annandale, is the Carlisle peck, 4 of which
make a Carlisle bushel.  A quart, adjusted by the standard measure, kept
at Carlisle, being a cylinder of 36 inches diameter, and 6 inches deep,
contains 64.152 cubic inches; therefore the gallon contains 256.608:
and 6 of these gallons being the Carlisle peck, it contains 1539.648 inch-
es, which is a small fraction more than 14 Scots pints 3 1/2 mutchkins, or
is decimally 14.877 Scots pints; and 4 of those Carlisle pecks being a
Carlisle bushel, one third of the said bushel is less than a Winchester bushel
by 97.56 inches, or nearly 3 mutchkins, 3 gills Scots.  The Scots pint here
referred to, contains 10.342.
   In grain of all kinds, sleek or even measure is used; but in lime mea-
sure, the peck is heaped; and in potato measure, generally 8 pecks,
of sleek or even measure are allowed to the bushel, and this measure is
meant in the foregoing Table.
