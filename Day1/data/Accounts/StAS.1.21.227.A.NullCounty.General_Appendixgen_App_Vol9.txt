year.  And what immense wealth would that number, or
even the one half of it, bring in yearly to the country, if pro-
perly employed!
   Another advantage, by which the fitness of this country for
manufactories will appear, is, that it is surrounded on all hands
almost by the sea, on the south, north, and west.  The very
centre of the country is not above 15 Scotch miles from the
sea.  And besides various places on the several coasts, there
are different places in the inland parts of the country that
would be fit for manufacturing villages, where the ground is
dry, the air good, and plenty of the best of water, as well as
the best of fuel, and from which roads could be made to the
sea at no considerable expence.  On most of the strath-lands,
the roads are very tolerable already, and a little expence would
make them perfectly good.  The proprietors of lands, especi-
ally Earl Gower and the Countess of Sutherland would be
great gainers by manufacturing schemes being carried into exe-
cution, as the people in general, who cannot be supposed to
have a comfortable subsistence on their small holdings, would
flock to the manufactories, where they would live well by
their labour; by which means, many small farms might be
formed into a great one, and thereby the lands would fetch a
far better rent.
   Earl Gower and Lady Sutherland possess almost 9 parishes
of the 13 of which this county consists; and if their people
could be comfortably provided for otherwise, they could, by
letting their lands in the Highlands to sheep farmers, get a
very great increase of rents, and inferior proprietors would
by the scheme gain their share.
   On the other hand, the people would live far more com-
fortably; and in place of decreasing, they would, in the
course of 20 years, increase to near double the number, as
there would be no emigrations, and they have a propensity to
