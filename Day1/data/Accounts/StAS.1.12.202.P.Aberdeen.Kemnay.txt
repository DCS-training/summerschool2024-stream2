     Statistical Account

   Seed-time and Harvest.-The time of sowing oats is, ge-
nerally, from the 2 d or 3 d week of March to the middle of
April; bear, from the end of April to the 20th of May;
and turnips, from the 10th to the 20th of June.  No other
crop besides these is raised in the district; and it is only about
4 or 5 years since any person but the principal heritor* be-
gan to sow turnips in the fields.  They are still sown in very
small quantities by the tenants.  Harvest generally begins
about the end of August, or the 1st week of September;
and the crop is brought into the barn-yards by the end of
October.  In 1775, harvest was completely finished by the
end of August; but such early seasons are, generally, followed
by a scarcity of straw, our only winter food for the horses and
cattle.

   Agriculture.-This useful art is very far from being in an
improved state in this parish.  The late Mr. Burnett of Kem-
nay set an excellent example, as a farmer, to his tenants.  Of
nearly 130 acres; which he enclosed and improved, between
90 and 100 acres were moor or marsh, which he broke up,
drained, and cleared of stones, of which there was an amazing
number, and the most of them so large, that they could not
be removed till they were blown up with gunpowder.  While
Mr. Burnett was improving these grounds, which he left in a
high state of cultivation, and paying well for the expense be-
stowed upon them, he planted, with trees of different kinds,
130 acres, besides hedge-rows, in the English mode, round
every field in his farm, on each side of the avenues leading to
his house, and in the little gardens of his tenants.  The wil-
derness already mentioned, was also enclosed and planted, while

the county of Aberdeen, who raised turnips in the fields.
