   Fishing and Buckhaven.-From the scarcity of haddocks
for some years, several of the fishermen have entered into
the navy, or on board merchant-ships, and others have be-
come day labourers in country work.  Formerly there
were in Easter Wemyss 5 boats, with 5 men each, and
one in Wester Wemyss, with 5 men, and now there is only
one boat in Easter Wemyss, and the crew consist of old
men.  In Buckhaven, the fishing is still continued with
little alteration in the number of fishermen; and though
fish are much scarcer than formerly, yet the fishermen are
in some measure compensated by the high price, and cer-

are haddock, cod, turbot, skate, whitings, soles, flounders,
makarel and herring.  A considerable quantity of lobsters
and crabs, or partons, (and sometimes a few cray or craw-
fish) are taken, with trap-creels let down into the sea upon
the rocks near the shore.  A worthy fisherman assured me,

fish caught here are sent to the Edinburgh market, and the
rest are sold in this neighbourhood by women, who carry
them in creels on their backs.  When fishing was plenty,
few of the fish caught in this parish were sent to Edinburgh,
because then the fishermen in the East of Fife carried their
fish to that market, and those being taken in deeper water,
and consequently larger, were always preferred.  At that
time most of the fish caught here were sold in the neigh-
bouring burghs, or bought up by men who carried them
in creels on horses to a considerable distance, where they
found a good market.  This last gave employment to many
in the parish; and a few years ago, some of them had got
neat carts fitted up for the purpose; but of late, they have
