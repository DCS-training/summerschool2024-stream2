next barley, then pease, then wheat, a few beans, and
occasionally a very little rye.  The quantity of ground sown
with oats is about 500 acres, with barley 200, with pease
50, and with wheat 10.  About 100 acres are annually em-
ployed in the production of sown grasses for hay, and about
double that quantity is pasture ground.  Potatoes form a part
of the food of all, and the greater part of most, of the pa-
rishioners.  The culture of them is generally considered as
favourable to the ground, and an excellent preparative for
grass crops:  because the necessity of keeping them clean de-
stroys the weeds, and the general idea of much manure be-
ing requisite to insure a good crop serves to secure the me-
lioration of the ground:  This latter advantage is great-
ly increased by the populousness of the town.  The
people in general collect considerable quantities of dung,
which they know not how to use to better purpose than the
cultivation of this root.  They accordingly manure the
land, plant the potatoes, and keep them clear of weeds; in
consequence of which, the gentlemen or neighbouring far-
mers allow them to have ground rent free.  Nearly 25 acres
are annually employed for this purpose.  The cultivation of
flax is so inconsiderable an object, that it is left more
of the charge of the housewife, than of the farmer.
Small patches of hemp, a plant which always thrives re-
markably well, are sometimes sown; but it is raised for the
use of individuals only. Plantations of trees of different
kinds cover at least 900 acres of ground.  They consist
chiefly of Scotch pines, oak, ash, beech, elm, plain, and
larch.  In all those plantations there is excellent shelter, and
in many parts of them very good pasture.

   Seed-time commences about the middle of March; but it
is as irregular as the climate is variable.  For it sometimes
