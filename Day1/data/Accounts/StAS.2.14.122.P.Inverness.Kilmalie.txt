     but has been very irregularly kept,-partly owing to the scattered
     state of the parish, and partly owing to the number of Episcopa-
     lians and Roman Catholics in the parish, who do not record the
     names of their children in the parish register.
        Modern Buildings.-The only modern building of consequence
     in this parish is Lochiel's mansion-house at Achnacarry, the an-
     cient family seat.  The house is a large, handsome, and substan-
     tial building, but it is not yet finished.  Colonel M'Lean of Ard-
     gour's hotse was burnt some years ago, and has been since rebuilt
     and enlarged.  It is situate near Corran Ferry, and surrounded
     with planting and shrubbery laid out with great taste.

     <TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>

                 In 1755, the population was        8093
                    1792,      "          "         4225
                    1801,      "          "         4600
                    1811,      "          "         5000
                    1821,      "          "         5527
                    1831,      "          "         4210
     The people employed on the   Caledonian Canal are included in
     the census of 1811 and 1821; but if the census of 1831 had been
     correctly taken, the population would certainly have been found to
     be more than 4210, notwithstanding of the number that left the
     country when the Canal was finished.

     <TABLE>
          In 1831, there was in the Inverness part of the parish,        2745 souls.
                 in Argyleshire,                                         1465
                 families in Inverness-shire,                             457
                      in Argylerhire,                                     230
                 males in Inverness-shire, 1340, females in ditto, 1405.
                 males in Argyleshire, 725, females in ditto, 740.

     About 1200 reside in the village of Fort William, which is situat-
     ed in Inverness-shire.  The yearly average of births cannot be as-
     certained on account of the number of Episcopalians and Roman
     Catholics in the parish.  There is no register of burials kept.  The
     yearly average of marriages for seven years may be about 30.  The
     number of children in each family at an average is 31/2. There
     are 610 inhabited houses.
         Language, &c.-The prevailing language is the Gaelic, but the
     English is gaining ground.  The people are very desirous to ac-
     quire the English language.  When one person wishes evil to an-
     other, it is not uncommon to hear a Highlander say, "Don beurla
     orta," i.e. may you never speak properly in English.  The inter-
     course with the south country by steam-boats, and the number of
     schools in particular, have tended to spread the English language
     among the inhabitants; but they prefer to receive religious in-
