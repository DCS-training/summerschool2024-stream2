called moor-stone*, of which the many excellent roads in this
parish are made.  There may be mentioned a singular basal-
tic rock upon the south side of Dundas-hill, 250 yards long,
and generally about 60 or 70 feet high.  This rock is almost
perpendicular in its front, and consists of light blueish granite, 
of a very close and fine texture:  The masses are in an irre-
gular columnar state, separated by channels or furrows; but
many well defined regular prisms are to be observed.  At the
foot of the steep, and almost perpendicular bank on which
this rock lies, is a morass of about 9 acres of shell marl.  But
what is chiefly remarkable and valuable as a mineral in this
parish, is the vast bed of free-stone upon the sea-cost.  A
quarry of this excellent stone has been wrought, to the ex-
tent of 3 acres, a little to the west of the borough of Queens-
ferry; and, besides supplying the demands of the neighbour-
hood, great quantities of it were privately exported for build-
ing the fortifications and quay of Dunkirk.  All the fine
stone carvings of Earl Fife's elegant house at Banff were exe-
cuted here upon the spot, and sent thither in cases by sea.  A
large baptismal font, 5 feet in diameter, intended for the Con-
tinent, with its bottom uppermost, and covered with sea-weed
and shell fish, lies opposite to this quarry a good way within
the sea mark; and which the antiquary might fancy to be
one of the remains of some Poppish church once standing 
there, that had been overwhelmed by the sea. Grindstones
are manufactured at this quarry, and annually exported to the
countries on the Baltic.  It is said, that here, and elsewhere
on the coast in this parish, there is such a quantity of free-
stone, that scarcely any demand could exhaust it.

*Whin-stone, or porphyry (called road-stone, rag-stone, etc.
in England) differs from moor-stone in this, that the former
contains iron, and also some lime.
