males; so that the females exceed the males by 291; upon an
average, they are somewhat under four to a family.  About
12 months ago, 100 families were dispossessed, and their hou-
ses pulled down to open a passage to the new bridge; but the
people seem to have got lodgings in the town, as the numbers
are not diminished. Two large houses are erected in place of
the old ones, which will accommodate 20 families.
   By a medium of births for 20 years, they amount to 82 an-
nually, but in these are included several from South Leith, who
attend public worship in North Leith, and have their childrens
names registered there; 1800 of the parishioners live in North
Leith, Coalhill and Citadel; the other 600, refide in the fishing
town of Newhaven and in detached houses in the country.
The number of marriages, at an average, is 25.  There is no
register kept of the dead, as the people grudged the expense
of it; and, indeed, it would not ascertain the number of those
who die in the parish, with any precision, as a great many
from South Leith and the neighbourhood, bury in North
Leith church-yard.  Almost all the parishioners attend the e-
stablished church. The number of other persuasions does not ex-
ceed 50.  There are no very old people in the parish; a few ex-
ceed 80 years.

   Manufactures and Rent, etc.-The principal manufacture
in the place is ship-building, and a number of fine vessels from
200 to 300 tons have been lately built.  There are 5 maller-
builders, who employ about 152 carpenters, whose wages are a-
bout is 10 d a day each.  There have been two dry docks erec-
ted within these sixteen years, one of which lets at L. 130 per
annum; the other is still more valuable, and is in the possession
of the proprieter. The great bulk of the inhabitants are car-
penters, sailors, and fishermen; there are a few anchor smiths,
and weavers.
