     NUMBER XXXIX.

     PARISH OF FEARN,

     (COUNTY OF ROSS.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN URQUHART.

     Name, Situation, Surface, Soil, etc.

   FEARN is evidently derived from the arn or alder
tree, in Gaelic Fearnn, as there were many of these
trees growing at Mid-fearn, in the parish of Eddertown, in
this neighbourhood, where the foundation of the abbacy
was in the 12th century first laid, and intended to be built.
But the churchmen in those days finding the lands there
confined, and not so fertile as they would incline, desisted
from their purpose, and got a new bull from the Pope, for
building the abbacy where it now stands, in a fertile and
extensive plain of good land.  It was founded here by
Farquhard, or Farquhar, first Earl of Ross, in the reign of
Alexander ll.-The parish is of no great extent, being on-
ly 2 English miles in length, and nearly of the same
breadth.  It is bounded on the S. by the parish of Nigg;
on the W. by Loggie (Easter); on the N. by Tain; and
on the E. and S. E. by Tarbat and the Murray frith.-It
is situated within the county of Ross, in the presbytery of
Tain, and in the Synod of Ross.-The soil is a deep loam,
