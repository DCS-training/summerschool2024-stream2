        Charitable and other Institutions.-The Caithness Agricultural
     Society, which was instituted about fifteen years ago, holds its an-

     five years ago, which has conferred important benefits on the
     trade of the place.
        The Wick and Pulteneytown Total Abstinence Society was in-

     drunkards.
