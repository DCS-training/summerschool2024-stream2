be called the lowlands of the parish, situated on the sea-coast,
and the banks of the Girvan, though there be a considerable
proportion of flat ground, yet the surface presents, in general,
a hilly appearance.  A great variety is to be found in the
soil; but that which is most prevalent, consists of a dry light.
mould, on a sandy, or gravelly bottom.  In the low part of
the parish, the air is remarkably dry and mild; and in the
light lands, vegetation begins 2 or 3 weeks earlier that in the
country in general.  In the high grounds, the air being much
colder, and more moist, vegetation of every kind is much more
backward.  It is generally thought there is abundance of coal in
the low part of the parish; but no attempts to discover it have
been yet made.  The inhabitants are plentifully supplied from
the coal-works in the parish of Dailly.  There is a great quan-
tity of lime-stone in the high part of the parish: but owing
to its distance from coal, the want of roads, or the unfitness
of the neighbouring grounds for agriculture, it has hitherto
been but little used.  The lowlands are well supplied from an
extensive lime-work in the neighbourhood.  Little or no free-
stone has, as yet, been discovered in the parish.  Pudding-
stone, and a kind of rotten rock, abound almost every where.
In some places the grey and blue whin-stone is found.  In
one spot a small quantity of gypsum, or plaster-stone; and, in
another, a considerable bed of shell-marl have been discovered.
The houses are all built of whin-stone, gathered partly from
the land, but chiefly from the sea-beach.
   The sea-coast extends upwards of 8 miles along the W. side
of this parish.  Above a third part of the shore is bold and
rocky; and, when flat, the beach is very generally covered
with large whin-stones.  In some parts a considerable quanti-
ty of sea-weed is occasionally left by the tide; and is used in
manuring the neighbouring lands.  A little kelp is made
