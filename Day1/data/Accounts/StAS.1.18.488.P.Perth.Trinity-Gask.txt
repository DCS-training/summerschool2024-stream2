upon the neighbouring heights swells the river, and carries away
the soil the whole depth of the furrow, and that frequently
after the feed is sown.  The land being thus deprived of its fer-
tilizing soil, and not infrequently covered with sand and gravel,
remains a long time in a state of barrenness.  The harvest
floods are sometimes alarming and ruinous to the farmer.
His fields of corn are often entirely destroyed, and
the grain carried down by the stream.  His mind is
kept in constant alarm, during the rainy season; and the sab-
bath is often spent in removing the crop to a place secure from
the reach of the water.  Upon lands thus situated, few im-
provements in agriculture can be carried on.  Inclosures,
whether by stone dykes, hedges, or ditches, are rendered use-
less by the floods from the river; the dykes are levelled with
the ground; the hedges torn up by the roots; and the ditches
filled up with land and gravel.  Proper drains in such situa-
tions are impracticable; and the manure laid upon the land
is often rendered useless, or wholly swept away.  The common
course of cropping on the extensive tract of land, which is
thus exposed, is 3 years in white crops successively; and 3
years, often 4, in lee.  Much land is also wholly lost by the
frequency with which the river changes its course.  No fewer
than 12 acres in one farm, have within a few years been carried
away from the banks, by the force of the water.  The only
remedy for these evils, is to straighten the course of the
water, and to secure it by proper embankments.
