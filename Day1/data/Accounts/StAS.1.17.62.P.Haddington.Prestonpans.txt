pans are erected into a burgh of barony, with the usual liber-
ties and privileges, The West Barony is that of Preston-
Grange.  The writer of this account has not been able to
learn in whose flavour, or at what periods the charter erected-
ing it was granted.-The soil is loam; part heavy, on a clay
bottom; part light, on a sandy or gravelly bottom.  The
climate is mild.  There are no local distempers.  The most
prevalent are fevers, chiefly those of the putrid and nervous
kind.  The gravel is laid to have been very common about
40 or 50 years ago.

   Agriculture.-The rotation of crops, most approved of at
present, is a white and green crop alternately.  Fallowing is
little practised.  The land is cleared of weeds, by sowing in
drills, and horse-hoeing the interstices; and women are often
employed to pick them out with the hand.  The land de-
signed for wheat is ploughed as soon as it is cleared of the
preceding crop.  If the land is heavy, the wheat is sown about
the middle of October; if light, about the beginning of Nov.
The land designed for oats, peases and beans, is plowed in
February.  Oats are sown about the end of March and be-
ginning of April.  If the land is dry, pease and beans are
sown in drills as early as possible in February; when broad-
cast they are sown early in March.  When pease and broad-
are to be sown in drills, sometimes the land gets two plow-
ings, the first after harvest, the second at the time of sowing,
the seed being thrown into every third surrow.  The land
designed for barley is three times plowed.  The first
plowing takes place immediately after harvest; the second
in the spring, as soon as the land is dry, commonly at the
end of March or beginning of April.  If the land be suffi-
ciently dry, March is reckoned preferable.  After this second
plowing it is harrowed.  The third plowing takes place
