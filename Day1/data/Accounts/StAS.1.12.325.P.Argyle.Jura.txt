     Of Fura and Colonsay.

   Metals, Minerals, etc.-There is iron-ore, and manganese
in Jura: about the middle of the island, there is a consider-
able body of slate; small quantities have been quarried, and
the colour and quality seem to be very good.  There is to be
found also, on the W. side of the island, in great abundance,
a very fine kind of sand used in the manufacture of glass.

   Antiquities and Curiosities.-There are several barrows
through the island; there are also pillars, and castellums, or
duns.  Three is one relick of antiquity of a singular kind.  In
more places than one, we can trace along the declivity of a
hill, the ruins of a wall, that was about 4 1/3 feet high, termi-
nating, perhaps, at a lake, or some very abrupt steep place.
At the lower extremity of the wall, there is a deep pit, a-
bove 12 feet diameter at the mouth, and very much contract-
ed at the bottom.  This, the tradition of the country says,
was a contrivance used in former times for taking the wild
boar.  The huntsmen drove him along the wall, till he took
refuge at last in the pit, and there was made captive.  At the
N. end of the harbour called the Small Isles, there are the re-

<FOOTNOTE>

The tax upon marriages and baptisms is matter of complaint, especially in
such a parish as this, where there is very little circulation of money.  It is such
a trifle, that it seems beneath the dignity of taxation, and goes contrary to the
famous jus trium liberorum, to strike at the very roots of national strength and
glory.  Instead of exacting such an odious tax, a small encouragement for keep-
ing parish records with greater attention, might turn out of much greater ad-
vantage to the state.
