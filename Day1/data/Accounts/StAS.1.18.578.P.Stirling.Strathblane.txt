and some of them are apparently bent in a segment of a curve
line.
   The highest hill in the parish is the Earl's seat, elevated
above the rest of the range, with a conical top.  Here the
Blanc has its source, whence it runs in a southwest direction
for 3 miles, and is then precipitated from the south side of
the hill, over several very high falls.  The most remarkable
of these is the spout of Ballagan, a cascade of 70 feet.  This,
when the river is swelled, puts on a very grand appearance.
Leaving the spout, the Blane turns due west; when after
running 8 miles in this direction, it loses itself in the Endrick,
which falls into Lochlomond.  It may here be observed, that
the Blane, with the whole district through which it runs,
has been omitted to be marked in Ainslie's map of Scotland.
   At the spout of Ballagan a very remarkable section of the
hill is presented.  The side of it, cut perpendicularly by the
water, discovers no fewer than 192 alternate strata of earth
and lime-stone.  Near the bottom of the section are found
several thin strata of alabaster of the purest white.  There
were found also near the same place, among the rubbish
thrown up by the river in a late inundation, some fragments
of antimony, which when tried by a chemical process, turned
out to be very rich specimens.  The source however, whence
these were dug, has not been discovered.  If it shall be
found, it may probably prove a valuable mine.
   There are 6 lakes in the parish, the largest of which does
not exceed half a mile in length, and a quarter of a mile in
breadth.  These lie in the moor-land part of the parish, and
contribute to render that a chearful prospect, which would
otherwise be bleak and dull.  They abound with pike,
perch, and trout.  They are also frequented by wild ducks,
and other aquatic fowls.  In the Blanc likewise, there are
