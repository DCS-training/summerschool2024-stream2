potatoes planted, which produce 40 bolls an acre; 62 do. of tur-
nips sown, which are worth L. 4 an acre.

	Besides the above, there were 6 bolls of pease sown; of the
36 bolls of bear, 3 were really barley; and all the present year's
calves and foals are excluded.
	The valued rent is L. 2360, 6s. 8d. Scots. The real rent is
L. 5925, 17s. 6d. Sterling, including L. 16, the rent of lime. The
common practice, as to sheep, is to keep one hog or young one for
every five ewes; and the average is, that the fleeces of nine sheep
weigh two stones, or forty-eight imperial lbs. As to cows, the cal-
culation is, that, taking the whole in the byre, the quantity of sweet
milk cheese made must be from fourteen to sixteen stones each;
twenty-two imperial lbs. being in the stone.
	In 1828, three cows were kept on the glebe, which calved near-
ly at the same time in the beginning of May, were pastured dur-
ing the day, and at night, and while the weather was excessively hot
at mid-day, were fed in the house with clover and vetches. The
family, consisting of five grown up persons and four children un-
der seven years of age, were amply supplied with milk, butter, and
cheese, during the whole year; and the remaining value of produce
from the cows amounted to L. 28, 14s. 2d. There were 71 stones
6 1/2 lbs of cheese sold, and a fattened calf.
	Dairy produce from this parish is sold as advantageously in Ed-
inburgh and Glasgow, as any brought from quarters of long-esta-
blished celebrity. A few still make both butter and cheese. In
one or two dairies, the curds of cows' milk and of ewes' milk being
wrought separately, are put one upon the other into the same vat,
and pressed; in consequence of which the cheeses. have two sides
of different qualities, and have been by some so highly relished,
