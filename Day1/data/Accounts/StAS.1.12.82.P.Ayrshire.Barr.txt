creased much for these 30 years; and the reason is obvious.
Proprietors of lands of late years have cast two or more of
their farms into the hands of one tenant; by which means, in
place of a family with cottagers and servants upon almost eve-
ry farm, there are some farms in which there is not one in-
habitant, and many where a shepherd man servant and his fa-
mily alone occupy the farm, which is no more than is abso-
lutely necessary to herd the grounds.  Of mechanics, there are 2
millers, 4 blacksmiths, 12 weavers, 6 masons, 3 carpenters, 2
shoemakers, 5 tailors, 5 inkeepers.  Of farmers 46; there are
many more farms in the parish; some individual farmers hold
some 2, others 3, 4, or 5 farms.  There is one seceder.

   Antiquities.-There is, about a mile S. W. of the parish
church, the remains of an old Popish chapel, standing on an
eminence, by a small river called Stencher.  There are no
traditional accounts worthy of communicating concerning this
chapel: it is called Kirk Domin‘, the Kirk of our Lady, sup-
posed to be dedicated in honour of the Virgin Mary.  When it
was built, is uncertain; but it had been in some repair in the
year 1693, as the roof was then taken down, and put upon the
parish church.  Though there is no village at this chapel, but
one small farm-house only, yet there is a great annual fair
held here upon the last Saturday of May, called Kirk Domi-
na Fair.
