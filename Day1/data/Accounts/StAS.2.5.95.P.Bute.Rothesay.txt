of the fields shows careful and skillful cultivation to  have arrived
at a pitch not often perhaps attained, and seldom exceeded, in the
more fertile district of the kingdom; and a glance at the amount
of the raw produce, as shown above, compared with that from the
former Statisitical Account, we gather it to have been at the pe-
