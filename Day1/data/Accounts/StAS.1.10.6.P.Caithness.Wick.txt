formed in the mouth of the creek.  Many vessels resort there
in summer, but cannot ride there with safety in winter.  It is
a kind of port, where considerable quantities of grain and meal,
the produce of the neighbouring country, are shipped off.
Several persons have commodious store houses, and some kilns
for smoaking herring have also been built there.  Ground is
feued out by Mr Dunbar, the proprietor, for dwelling houses,
at the rate of 10 s. per acre per annum for 99 years.

   Noss-Head.-Near Castle Sinclair, is a high rocky promon-
tory called Noss-Head, conspicuous some miles off even in the
middle of the country, and visible at a vast distance at sea.
If a beacon were erected here, and a light house at Duncansby-
head, seamen would have a good direction for regulating their
course through the dangerous navigation of the Pentland
Frith.  Many accidents have happened by vessels steering too

tensive plan.  Not far from these venerable ruins is Acker-
gill Tower, once the residence of the Earls Marischall, now
the seat of Benjamin Dunbar of Hempriggs, the proprietor of
a very considerable estate in the neighbourhood.  In the Tower
there is a large high vaulted hall, and another just above it,
now in disuse; the walls are of such breadth, that 12 or 14
could conveniently fit at table in one of the windows.  It is
built close by the sea, and near it is an extensive tract of green,
