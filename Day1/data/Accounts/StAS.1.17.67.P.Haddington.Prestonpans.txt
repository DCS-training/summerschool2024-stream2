facture circulates upwards of 25 L. per week.  At Morison's
Haven there is another manufacture of the same kind, with
the addition of brown ware*.  About half the number of
men and boys are employed as at the former.  Clay for the
brown ware is found hard by the work.  A third manufac-
ture of the above articles was carried on at the Cuttle, but
has been discontinued for a year or two; it is, however, a-
bout to be resumed.  The sales, for articles of earthen ware,
are computed at upwards of 5000 L. per annum.  Besides the
Scotch market, the ware is exported to most of the sea ports
in Europe, to the West Indies, and to North America.-

medium, are 1 s. per day.  This season 13 kilns were fired
with tiles, each kiln containing 10,000.  Of bricks 107,000
were made.  Each kiln with tiles consumed 21 cart-loads of
coals, at 3 s. 6 d. per cart-load of 12 cwt.  One cart load,
partly great coal, partly culm, is required, at an average, for
