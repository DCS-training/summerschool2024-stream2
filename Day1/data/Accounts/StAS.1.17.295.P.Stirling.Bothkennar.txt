   THE writer of this account has not been able discover
the origin of the name Bothkennar.  This parish is
situated in that track of country commonly called the Carse
of Falkirk; is about a mile and a half in length, and nearly
of equal breadth.  It is bounded on the north by the parish
of Airth; on the west, by the parish of Larbert; on the
south, by the parishes of Falkirk and Polmont; and on the
east, by the river Forth.  It seems antiently to have been
bounded on the south by the river Carron, but that river
having changed its course, now intersects both the parishes
of Bothkennar and Falkirk, leaving part of the former on
the south, and a small part of the latter upon the north side
ef it.  The parish contains 96 oxgangs of land, which, at
the computation of 13 acres each, amount in whose to 1248;
the yearly valuation of which, including cess, feu-duty pay-
able to the family of Marr, and minister's stipend, is 3591 l.
