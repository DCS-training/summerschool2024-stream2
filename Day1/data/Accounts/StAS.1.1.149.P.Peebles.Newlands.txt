   Springs, Mines, and Minerals.-Chalybeate springs abound
every where.  There is red free-stone in Broomyleas; and
from Romanno down the Lyne whin-stone abounds.  From
Noblehouse to Wheam the hills abound in iron-ore and iron-

600 cows, consisting of dairy cows, and young ones coming
up to replace the old; besides about 100 more fed on fatten-

sheep.  Young horses are bred for sale from the plough
mares.

   Almost the first dairy farming in Tweeddale was begun in

the farmer turned his attention to cows, and found the
