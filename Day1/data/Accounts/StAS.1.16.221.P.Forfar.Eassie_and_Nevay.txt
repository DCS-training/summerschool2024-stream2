     of Essie and Nevay.

   Character.-The inhabitants of this territory are sober
and industrious, strangers alike to intemperance and dissi-
pation of every kind.  The vice of dram-drinking, which
if we may rely on Statistical information, so much prevails
in many parishes of Scotland, is here unknown.  There is
not a tavern or alehouse in either parish.  These people,
however, are open, generous and hospitable.  That service
spirit, which diffused itself among the lower class during
the rigour of the feudal system, no longer exists; and pas-
sions then predominant have subsided.  They are neither
proud nor parasitical.  Mild and peaceable, they are nei-
ther ready to resent an injury, nor to harbour revenge.
Attached to the national church, and the present form of
government, they are not inclined to schism, nor prone to
sedition, nor liable to change.  Not a few of them enjoy
the benefits and comforts of society, and all are contented
with their condition.
