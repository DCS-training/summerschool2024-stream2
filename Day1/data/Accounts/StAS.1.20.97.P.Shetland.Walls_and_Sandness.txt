     PARISH OF WALLS AND SANDNESS,

     (County of Orkney and Zetland, Presbytery of
     Zetland.)

     By the Rev. David Thomson.

     Name.

   This ministry is composed of the united parishes of
Walls, Sandness, Papastour, and Fowla.  The origin
and meaning of these names are more conjectural than cer-
tain.  They are supposed to belong to Norte, the ori-
ginal language of the country.  It is believed by some au-
thors, that the names of places ending with the syllable
wall, were places where courts of justice were anciently
held, some of which might have been in this parish.  San-
ness, or Sandness, has probably its origin from the situation
of the district so called, and from the nature of the soil.  It
is situated in a ness or headland, almost surrounded by the
sea; and the soil is light and sandy.  Stour, which signifies
great, is annexed to Papa, to distinguished it from other islands
