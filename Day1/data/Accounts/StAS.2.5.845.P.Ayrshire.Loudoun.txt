Her daughter died with the words "my mother" on her lips, and
the mother, in the feverish sleep which immediately preceded her
death, often spoke of "her Flora."
	A year after her death, a volume of Lady Flora's poems was
published and edited by her talented and devoted sister, Lady
Sophia. It will be an enduring monument not only of the exten-
sive aquirements, refined taste, and lofty peotic genius of its au-
thor, but also of the desire, on her part and on that of her family,
to do good of Loudoun, as the proceeds of the volume, in further-
ance of a wish she had once expressed, were to be devoted to some
object of usefulness in the parish. All who peruse these poems
will agree in the opinion expressed of them by an able renewer,
that "Such a deep love for the beautiful, the exalted, and the holy,
reigns throughout them all, that it is impossible to repel the con-
viction that her actions accorded with her words, and that her
words, gave but utterance to the calm and sinless feelings of her
heart."
	The chief Land-owners in the parish are the following, with
their respective valuations in pounds Scots:

	Map of the Parish.--The parish was surveyed by Robert Aitken,
Beith, in 1829, and an excellent lithograph from this survey
was published the same year by Ballantyme in Edinburgh.
	Antiquies.--Since the last Statistical Account was written,
few antiquities have been discovered worth noticing. In Loudoun
Park, some years ago, five stone coffe were found beneath a large
cairn of stones. They contained what appeared to be the dust of
