   The only physical advantage, which it has, arises from the in-
undations of the Clyde.  The overflowings of this river, depo-
site a kind of slime over all the haughs, which generally
makes them produce good crops of oats, without receiving a-
ny dung.
   The general rent of the best arable ground is L. 1: 5. the
rent of the inferior, 10 s.  The rent of the farms is from
L. 79 to L. 30.  The number of farms, as already observed,
is greatly diminished, and will be diminished more and more

the inroads of all kinds of cattle during the winter.
   The land-rent of the parish, at present, is exactly L. 1819.
But were the lands improved, as they ought, the rental might
be raised much higher.

hart of Carnwath is patron.

   Poor.- The number of poor in the parish, is 12.  The fund
