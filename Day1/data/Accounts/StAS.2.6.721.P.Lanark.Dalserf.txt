   The average height of the thermometer throughout the year is
54.1805, morning, and 48.44 in the evening.  The barometer in
the morning averages 29.61, and in the evening 29.02.  The quantity
of rain falling is 21.7739 inches.  These results, if compared with
those in many places lying considerably to the east, will be found
to be in favour of this part of Scotland.  At Kinfauns Castle, near
Perth, latitude 56&deg; 23', the mean temperature for the year 1830
was 47.626 ; here it is 48 and upwards ; the quantity of rain which
fell at the former place was 30.85 inches ; here it is only 21.7739
inches.  We may probably, however, have a greater number of wet
or cloudy days, although less rain falls in a given time.  But whatever
may be the result of a comparison with other places, the climate of
the parish may be described, in general terms, as dry and salubrious.
There are probably few places in Scotland more favourable to
health.  The people are not liable to any prevalent distemper.
Epidemics are of rare occurrence, and when they do visit us, are
generallx of a mild character, even in the crowded villages, and soon
disappear.  Dalserf was one of the few parishes in this neighbour-
hood, which, in 1832, bad no case of cholera.  The temperature, of
course, varies in different places, according to the degree of eleva-
tion above the level of the Clyde.  In the sheltered vale along the
banks of the river, the blossoming of the fruit-trees, and vegetation
in general, are from ten to fifteen days earlier than on the rising
grounds and slopes in the immediate vicinity.
   Hydrography.-The principal rivers connected with the parish
are the Clyde and Avon, which form, as has been stated, its east-
ern and western boundary.  The stream next in point of size is the
Cander, which falls into the Avon.  That portion of the parish
which is bounded by this stream is called the district of Cander
