Bybell,in his hands; and there after past to the mans and gleib of
the said parsonage and vicarage and there, be delyveriny to him of
erth and stane, put him in real and peaceable possession of the said
kirklands thereof, with all the pertinents thereto."  Having, in
this manner, then, been first conjoined under the ministry of this
Mr James Baillie, the two old parishes of Wandell and Lamming-
toune have ever since continued to form but one cure or benefice.
   The barony and parish of Wandell, with the exception, of Lit-
tlegill, (noticed in a former part of this account as having been
purchased about sixty years ago,) came into possession of the illus-
trious house of Douglas, early in the seventeenth century, the
charter to which in favour of William, Earl of Angus, in liferent,
and Archibald, Lord Douglas, his eldest son, in fee, bears date
15th June 1613,-that is, five years after Mr James Baillie had
become "persone and vicar of Hartsyde" as well as Lamington.
He died, it appears, about 1642, when a most violent contest en-

vacant benefice.  The Earl presented a Mr Andrew M'Ghie, and
Lammingtoune issued his presentation in favour of a Mr John
Currie.  The presbytery failing to effect an amicable arrange-
ment between the two claimants, the matter was referred to the
General Assembly, who, after maturely weighing "the rights and
evidences of both parties," and i hearing "the advice of faithful and
skilful lawyers," "advised the presbytery to proceed in the planting
of the kirk of Wandell and Lammingtoune with Mr Andrew
M'Ghie."  The presbytery accordingly "in regard that the said
Mr Andrew had given satisfaction in his tryalls,"-"appointed
him to preach on the following Sunday before the congregation,
in the afternoon," and Mr George Bennet, oneof their number, to
preach in the forenoon, "and to take aspection of the people's
carriage."  But what followed?-A scene of the utmost violence
and confusion, which affords a strange picture of the refinement,
delicacy, and retiring habits of the titled and high-born dames of
our country towards the middle of the seventeenth century! Mr
George Bennet, it appears, was permitted to preach in the fore-
noon, a appointed by his brethren ; but as it was only by "shoot-
ing and ramforcing the doors of the kirk" that the moderator on a
previous occasion had found access; so now upon the present ec-
