circumstances, independent either of lairds or factors; they
live in a neat, handsome, and hospitable manner, and give

have had a liberal education.  They employ in farming the
considerable funds acquired by their fathers in the same line

expences on this score.-These rates have always been the
chief support of the poor, the collections at the church doors
being very scanty indeed.  The number of poor at present, is
12; the sum raised for their support is L. 32: 14 s. which di-
