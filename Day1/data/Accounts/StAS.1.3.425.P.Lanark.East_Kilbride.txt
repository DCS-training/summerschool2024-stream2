ty of stone they turn out.  Each man gains about 9 s. per
week, at a medium.  The quantity of lime produce, in
1790, was 9845 chalders, which, at 6 s. 8 d. per chalder, a-
mounts to 3281 L. 17 s. 4 d. Sterling.  About 40 men are em-
ployed in the iron stone mines, of wchich there are many in the
parish.  The stone is consumed in the Clyde iron work.  The
mining of coal is not so extensive as that of iron stone.
There are two coal works in the parish; the one belongs to
Alexander Stewart of Torrance, Esq; the other is in the lands
of Lickprivick, the property of John Boyes, Esq.  About
20 men are usually employed at both.  The coals produced
from these works are not sufficient to supply the inhabitans
with fuel; the deficiency is made up with excellent peats,
with which the parish abounds, and with coals of the best
quality from Cambuslang, at the distance of a few miles.

   Wages, Provisions, and Education.-Masons and wrights re-
ceive from 20 d. to 2 s. for their day's work; a common la-
bourer 1 s. or 14 d.; a man servant, in the farming business,
gets from 4 L. to 5 L. per half year; and a woman servant,
2 L.  Marketable commodities find a ready sale in Glasgow,
which is distant from the village of Kilbride 7 miles and a
half.  It is owing to this, that provisions off all kinds are
nearly as dear as in Glasgow.  The education of youth, how-

the public school, for 14 d. per quarter; writing and arith-
metic, at 2 s.; and Latin at 2 s. 6 d.

   General Character.-The people, in general, are industrious
and frugal.  The possess, from their forefather, a coura-
geous and independent spirit, which, as it enables them, on
the one hand, to bear misfortunes with magnanimity, so it
forbids them, on the other, to receive, with impunity, the
