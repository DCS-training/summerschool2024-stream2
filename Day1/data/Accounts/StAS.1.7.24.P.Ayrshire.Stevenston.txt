The reason of this may be, that the Saltcoats busses are too
large, from 80 to 90 tons, navigated by 18 men.  The ex-
pence of their maintenance for more than three months, and
that of the nets, salt, etc. exhaust all the profit of their
small cargoes, together with the bounty, nosy in part with-
drawn; whereas the Highland busses are only from 60 to
65 tons, navigated by l0 or 11 men.  But the principal
reason may be, that the Highland sailors and rowers are
more expert at the business than ours.

   Notwithstanding these discouragements, the number and
value of the vessels belonging to the port have doubled with-
in these last twelve years, and doubtless the trade increased in
some proportion to this.  The number at present is

              18 vessels below 100 tons
              23 from 100 to 200 tons

</TABLE>

Total vessels 41, the registered tonnage of which is about
4300 tons, navigated by above 320 men.  About a dozen of
the largest of these vessels do not frequent their own incom-
modious port, but find employment, in the carrying trade, in
the ports of Glasgow, Liverpool, and London*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The carrying trade has been greatly hurt by a late Regu-
lation of the Congress, according to which, goods imported in-
to America in British bottoms, pay considerably more duty than
goods imported in American bottoms.  The effect of this might
be easily destroyed by a counter-regulation of the British go-
vernment, to confine the benefit of their debentures entirely to
goods exported from this island in British bottoms.  Without
some such regulation, this kind of trade, so important to Bri-
tain in raising a nursery of sailors, is in some danger of being
transferred to America, as our merchants already employ their
ships, and let our's lie idle.
