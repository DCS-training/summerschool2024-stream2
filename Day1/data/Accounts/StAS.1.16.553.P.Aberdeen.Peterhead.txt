parish of Crimond, which is nearly half way betwixt this
town and the light-house at Kinnaird's head, in the parish
of Fraserburgh, at the mouth of the Murray Frith.  That
light is probably of great service to prevent ships being
wrecked on Rattry-head which come from the north and
down the Murray Frith; but ships sailing to the northward
are frequently wrecked on Rattry-head, or rocks near it,

erected, than at any period during the same length of time
before it was established.

with which I am acquainted, of any battles in this parish,
or sea-sights near the coast.  There is a tradition of a duel
or accidental rencounter betwixt two men a long time ago.
One of the parties yeas killed, and buried in the spot where

   Forts and Moat.-There are two sorts situate about two
or three miles west of the town, both of small extent.  The
moat, parapet, foot-bank, bastions, etc. are very conspicu-

Bowness, from being erected when bows were used.  The
other is at Mount Pleasant, directly opposite to the house of
Inverugie, in the parish of St Fergus.
   There is a small moat on a little eminence, called the
Mete-hill; a mound of earth evidently artificial, and
