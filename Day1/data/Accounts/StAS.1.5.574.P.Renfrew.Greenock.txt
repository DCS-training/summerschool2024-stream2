     Statistical Account

The late minister was the second since the erection of the
new parish.  Besides the two parish churches, there are in
Greenock a Chapel of Ease, built about 20 years ago, the
Gaelic chapel, above mentioned, a Burgher and an Anti-
burgher meeting-house.  In the adjoining village of Craw-
furdsdike, the Burghers have another place of worship.
The number, however, of those who have entirely separa-
ted themselves from the church, is by no means great.  It
is curious to remark, that about 156 years ago, the churches
of Kilmacolm and Innerkip were neighbouring churches.
There are now between them 10* places of worship, viz,
three churches and three chapels of the Establishment, and
four houses belonging to the Secession; and, where there
were scarcely as many hundreds about the beginning of
the present century, there are now about 19,000 people.

burgh of barony, erected in the year 1757, by Sir John
Shaw, who was then superior.  The village of Cartsdike,
or Crawfurdsdike, which has a good harbour and quay,
older than those of Greenock, is also a burgh of barony.
It was erected in 1633, by King Charles II.

   Road and Harbour.-Of the road and harbour of Green-
ock many things might be said, but a few must suffice.
By a sand bank of considerable breadth, stretching from
Dunbarton to a little below the town, the road is made
narrow, and the navigation to Port-Glasgow rendered
sometimes tedious and difficult.  At low ebbs, (except
