yield, at least, 500 L. more.  It is hoped we shall soon learn
to do so, especially as a bleachfield is established in the pa-
rish, in consequence of encouragement and aid given to it,
by the Duke of Argyll.

   Miscellaneous and Observations.-The valued rent of the parish
is 910 L 9 s. 5 d. Sterling.  The real rent, from the great
number of proprietors in the town, and from some of the
heritors having much of their property in their own hands,
cannot be precisely ascertained.  The quantity of butcher
meat, slaughtered yearly for the town and ships, is computed
to be as follows; namely,

      1000 head of cattle, weighing about 256,000 lib. Eng.
       800 sheep                             28,800

<FOOTNOTE>

*A mode lately adopted at this office, and, it seems, at some
others, makes it much less useful to the people, and productive
to the revenue, than it would otherwise be.  The runners, in
conformity, it is presumed, to law and established usage, were
in the practice of delivering the letters in town, at a time when,
at any rate, they were waiting their dispatches, and of convey-
ing such letters to places on the road, as did not lie out of their
way.  But now, unless the inhabitants of the town and coun-
try shall constantly repair to the office to inquire for their own
letters, they may be returned as dead, without their ever hear-
ing of them.  This must be the care, especially with respect to
those who are seldom in the receipt of letters, and do not there-
fore know when to look or call for them, as the faculty of the
second-sight is lost, which would be necessary to give them, or
the revenue, that benefit for which the office was intended.
