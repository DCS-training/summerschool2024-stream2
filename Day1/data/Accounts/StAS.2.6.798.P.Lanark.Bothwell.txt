   All the Glasgow and Edinburgh coaches which go by the south
road pass along the whole length of the parish upwards of eight
miles, and the Glasgow and Carlisle mail, the Hamilton, Lanark,
and Strathaven coaches run about four miles through it, along the
great London road, each twice a day.  A railway has been commenced,
and is in a fair way of being soon completed for the purpose
of connecting the Clydesdale or upper coal-field of Lanarkshire
with the city of Glasgow.  The Wishaw and Coltness Railway
Company was incorporated for this purpose by an act passed
in 1829.  The railway is to run through the estates of Carnbroe,
Jerviston, Carfin, Dalziel, Wishaw, Coltness, Cleland, and
Allanton.
   The length of the respective lines of this railway, and the estimated
expense, are as follows:

   Total expense of jerviston lot,      -     -	      17,000  0  0

   As the work has proceeded, the expense has been found greatly
to exceed the original calculation.
   Ecclesiastical State.--Bothwell and Shotts anciently formed one
parish, which was divided at the Reformation.  At the period of
the Revolution 1688, this district seems to have been very destitute
of Presbyterian minister.  It is minuted in the Presbytery
books of Hamilton, 6th September 1687; " The parishioners of
Bothwell of the Presbyterian persuasion give a call to Mr Robert
Muir, who at the same time is called to three or four other places."
January 24th 1688, " They call Mr Russel, who like Mr Muir,
refuses to come." June 27th 1688, " They call Mr John Orr,
and are opposed by another parish, though Mr Orr was not yet
licensed.  He was ordained at Hollowtown (Holytown), 26th September
1688 in face of the congregation."  Mr William Cullen
