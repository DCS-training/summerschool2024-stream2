of an enemy*.  The air is rather moist, and in some seasons
of the year there are heavy rains for a continued time, ow-

Arran hills.

   Minerals, Agriculture, Soil, etc.-There are some free-
stone, and several lime quarries.  But there is no coal
wrought in the parish, which is a great loss to the inhabi-
tants, who are at a considerable distance from it.  Several
attempts have been made for it in different parts of the pa-
rish, but they have hitherto proved ineffectual.  This parish
and neighbourhood is remarkable for large good milk cows,
of which several persons have from 10 to 20.  They make fine
sweet milk cheese, for which there is a great demand, and
which gives a very high price.  A tenant of Sir William
Cunningham of Livingston, who was then proprietor of
Robertland estate in this parish, got a premium several
years at Edinburgh for the best cheese in Scotland.  This
estate is now the property of Sir John Hunter Blair.  A-
bout 30 years ago there were few or no inclosures in the
parish, but now it is mostly inclosed and subdivided, and
pays from 20 s. to 30 s. the acre, and some of it more, which
must make the real rent very great, especially as the ground
is mostly arable.  The valued rent is about L. 7000 Scots,
and I suppose the real rent may be about L. 7000 Sterling.
But as many of the small heritors have their farms in their
own hands, it is difficult, for this and some other reasons, to
be exactly ascertained.  The soil is various in different parts
of the parish.  At the head of it, which borders with the
Mearns moor, it is not so good, but in the lower part it is
mostly a strong clay soil.  There are upwards of 90 ploughs
employed.  The method of improving land here is the
