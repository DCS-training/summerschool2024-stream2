     Statistical Account

   As few or none of the heritors reside within the bounds
of this district, and as not any of the non-residing heritors
contribute any sum whatever for the maintenance of the
poor; their support must depend on the families of the mi-
nister and parishioners.
   The heritors of Stronsay agreed, about fifteen years ago,
to give a salary of three pounds Sterling to a schoolmaster.
But this salary, small though it be, hath not been regularly
paid; and to procure, in terms of law, a salary and school-
house, would infer greater expence than the minister can,
in his present circumstances, afford.  The heritors are un-
willing, and the parishioners of Stronsay and of Eday are
unable, to accomplish this desirable end.  A society-school,
hath, for several years past, been a great benefit to the poor
children in the parish of Stronsay.  Such a school is highly
necessary in the island of Eday; but numberless applications,
at different periods, by the minister to the society for propa-
gating christian knowledge, have been rejected, on account
of a regulation which that society have long adopted; viz.
to establish their schools only in parishes which have paro-
chial schools or salaries paid by some of the heritors or by
the parishioners.

   Climate and Diseases.-The situation of this district, sur-
rounded as it is by the sea, and at a moderate elevation above
the level of it, is thus rendered wholesome and agreeable,
particularly during the summer months, when the seasons
are dry land warm; but as it is exposed to heavy rains and
thick weather in winter, with gales of wind in spring and
autumn, those who cannot easily put up with retirement, and
to be confined within narrow bounds, for seven or eight
months, must find it an uncomfortable place of residence.
