85 bolls of victual, partly meal, and partly bear, and 26 L. 12 s.
in money.  But an augmentation, with the concurrence of
the heritors, will soon be obtained.

   School-The school-house, with abundance of accommo-
dation for the school-master, was rebuilt about 10 years ago.
The presbytery have, by a committee of their number, now
twice examined the schools within their bounds, and mean to
continue the practice annually, as they see the best effects re-
sulting from it.  In general, attention is paid to the education
of youth, and their morals are not neglected.  Indeed, it
were to be wished that more encouragement were given to
men who have such an important trust, as a spur to their di-
ligence in office, if it would have that effect.

   Poor.-The funds, for supporting the poor, arise from the
interest of their mortified money, from the collections made
for them at the church, and from the fees given for the use
of their mortcloths.  They receive nothing from marriages,
or baptisms, and very little from the fines exacted from those,
who have been guilty of irregularity of conduct.  The fol-
lowing is a state of the number of the poor, and of the funds
for supporting them, from the year 1781, to the year 1791,
inclusive.
