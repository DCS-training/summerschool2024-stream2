veral into one.  Here, by the diminution and separation
of farms.  Previous to 1769, the whole estate of Aber-
nyte, which is more than half the parish, was let to four
farmers, who possessed their arable lands in the old state of
run ridge, and held their grass in common.  A division
was then made, and the estate split into five farms of a
larger kind, and 8 or 10 of smaller dimensions.  The te-
nants of this last order, being generally manufacturers, with
large families, managed their little farms without the assist-
ance of any servants.  And the others preferred unmarried
servants, who, living in the house, were constantly under
their eye, to cottagers; who having families at home, were
supposed to pay more attention to them than was consistent
with their master's interest.  Another cause that has affect-
ed population in some degree, is the non-residence of some
farmers, and the inclosing and turning into grass a large
farm, which has now upon it neither farmer nor servant.
In a large district the operation of these causes would be
scarce felt; but in a small parish like this, their effects are
more conspicuous.  There is scarce a place in the parish
now that deserves the name of a village.  Three hamlets
contain among them 41 houses.  The other houses are
scattered through the parish; many of them stand singly,
a few of them in pairs or greater numbers.  All the inha-
bitants are natives of Scotland.  There are 88 married per-
sons; 13 widows and 3 widowers; males above 8 years,
126; females, 150; males below 8, 39; females, 30.
