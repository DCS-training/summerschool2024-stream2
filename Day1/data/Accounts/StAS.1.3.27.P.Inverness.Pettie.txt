count by artificial grass, and green crops.  A few of the oc-
cupiers of the larger farms havemade inclosures; some with
hedge-rows, and some with stone-dykes; they raise green
crops, sow artificial grasses, and have adopted the other
modes of cultivation introduced into the more improved
parts of the country.  But the whole of the ordinary te-
nantry still retain the same practices that were followed by
their predecessors.  Their fields are quite open-there is no
grass sown,-no fallow,-no green crops raised; but barley
sown with manure, and oats without it, as long as the land
will produce more than the seed sown in it; after which it is
allowed to rest three years as lee, and then it is broke up to
undergo the same treatment.

   The manure used is the dung of the cattle of the farm,
made into a compost dunghill, with at least twice as much
earth or sand.  Such as live on the side of the Frith, get
some sea-weed or ware, which they lay on their lands, and
which gives in strong lands a good crop of barley; but the
succeeding crops of oats are generally poore than after the
ordinary dung.  In light soil the ware does not answer when
the season is dry, but opens it too much.

   Though, from the improper management of the lands, this
parish does not produce near so much grain as it otherwise
might; yet in the most undsvourable years, it produce more
than is sufficient for the maintenance of the inhabitants.  The 
price is various; but in general, the boll of oat-meal weigh-
ing nine stone Dutch is nearly a shilling cheaper than the
boll of barley; and the barley in general sells vey nearly at
the Haddington pieces.  Besides grain, there is a good deal
of potatoes raised, not only by the tenants, but also by the
crosters and cottagers.  Some of the tenants raised flax
which the women spin and get manufactured into linen.
