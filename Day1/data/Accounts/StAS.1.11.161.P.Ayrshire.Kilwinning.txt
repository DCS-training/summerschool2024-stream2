*There are none in the country parish:  Those in the town are by far too
many for the number of inhabitants, and are but too often nurseries of idleness
and vice, Whisky is what they chiefly drink.  From its cheapness, the dissi-
pated and profligate indulge themselves in it to excess, to the hurt, and fre-
quently the ruin of their families.  Were government to raise the duties on whisky,
and lower them on ale, this, in all probability, would increase the revenue, and
send most effectually to promote the industry, the health, and the morals of the
people.

++ During the last war there were in the navy 13, and in the army 5, from
this parish.
