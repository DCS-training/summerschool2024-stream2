pense, it certainly does not tend to strengthen him for his labours,
like the home-brewed beer, formerly in use.
	The farm-servants who receive an allowance of meal and milk,
and who are lodged in apartments separate from the farm-house,
called bothies, cook their own victuals, which usually consist of
milk-brose for breakfast, dinner, and supper. This bothie system,
so common at one time in the lowlands of this county, is but lit-
tle prevalent in this parish; and happily for the morals and man-
ners of a numerous and important class of the community, seems
rather getting into disuse.
	The social and substantial dish, and especial favourite of our
forefathers "the kail-brose of auld Scotland" is now in a great
measure unknown among the younger generation; and very proba-
bly the brose-bicker disappeared with the gudeman from the table-
head, when, in the progress of refinement, he ceased to preside at
the family board, around which the whole household used to as-
semble at meals, and where his presence and conversation produ-
ced the most beneficial effects on the manners and morals of the
domestics.
	The greater number of the agricultural population, being under
an indulgent and liberal landlord, and various of them occupying
under old leases, they in consequence a reasonable share of the
comforts and advantages of society, and generally speaking, are con-
tented with their situation and circumtances; and if there be any of
the parishioners less so, they are to be found chiefly amongst the ma-
nufacturing classes, who are exposed to the fluctuations peculiar to
their line of employment; and yet these are far less felt in this
quarter than in many other places, for several of the weavers rent
small possessions of land; others, when times are unfavourable to
them, enfafe in farm labours; and from there being always a con-
siderable demand for labour at the quarries, those who are able
and willing to work, seldom want employment.
	Though the division of labour commonly observed among the
agricultural part of the population, the unvarying task of the wea-
vers, and the hard labour of the quarries, be but little favourable
to the acquisition of knowledge, and though our distance from the
colleges, and our vacinity to manufacturing towns, give but little
taste for classical learning, yet the parishioners have all received
an education suitable to their condition in life, and are on the whole
as intelligent as their neighbours, and as can be reasonably ex-
pected in their circumstances; and considering their exemplary at-
