of the Market Street, in the vicinity of the spot where the cross for-
merly stood. A few years ago, having fallen into disrepair, a con-
venient piece of ground was purchased for the purpose of a new
erection; but as the city funds were deemed to be inadequate for
the undertaking, the old fabric was repaired and enlarged, and it
is now sufficiently commodious for the purposes for which it is re-
quired.
   Modern Buildinqs.--Handsome Chapels, for the use of the Epis-
copalians, and for those who are connected with the United Asso-
ciate Synod, have been erected within these few years. The flour
mills belonging to the Incorporation of Bakers have been lately re-
built at considerable expense. A sinning-mill has been in opera-
tion since 1823, its machinery being moved by steam. Thirty years
ago, there was a manufactory of sail-cloth of a superior quality,
but it was afterwards abandoned, and has not, been revived.

                        III.-POPULATIO14.
No enumeration of the population of the parish has been discovered of an older date
than that of Dr Webster in 1755, when the amount was 4590
                        in 1793, it amounted to      3950
                           1801,                     4203
                           1811,                     4311
                           1821,                     4899
                           1831,                     5621

   Of the last of these dates, 2520 were males, and 3101 females.
The feuing of a considerable portion of ground at the village of
Stratbkinness, for the purposes of erecting houses, has contributed
materially to the increase of population in the country district of
the parish. The city has also considerably enlarged its bounda-
ries, by modern erections at its south-east and north-west extremi-
ties, and by the filling up of a number of blanks in the streets and
lanes. The number of families who resort to St Andrews for the
purpose of education, or as a place where they may enjoy agree-
able society and the necessaries of life at a moderate expense, has
also materially increased.
