fave more of the produce of their farms, than the Highlanders,
are yet accustomed to.-It is likely that the Lowlanders
example will be followed in that, as it is already in managing
their sheep-stocks, and in acquiring more independance on
their landlords, than was formerly usual.  The tenants all now
get tacks, maintain better the bargains they make with the
proprietor, and know better the way to courts, independant

on the whole, more agreeable than hard seasons, especially of
snow, of which we have had but little, and, in general, of
short continuance, for many years past.

   Agriculture.-The number of farmers, by the introduction
of sheep and other causes has certainly decreased.  Many of the
tacksmen, however, still continue to retain some subtenants,
who, having a cow's grass, some ground to raise potatoes, and
a little grain, for the sake of the straw, as sodder during the
winter, with the opportunity of fishing, etc. find themselves
easier and better off, than when they occupied a larger posses-
sion; and even those who have been obliged to emigrate, have
in general, settled at Greenock, where they seem bet-
