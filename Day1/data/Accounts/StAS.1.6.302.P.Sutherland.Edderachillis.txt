   There are but few in this parish that may be called real ob-
jects of charity.  The native inhabitants are all connected by
blood, and few strangers dwell among them, so that they assist
each other, and scarcely any are in want of bread.  The poor-

own; and if any go about for charity as beggars, they are com-
monly such as come from distant parishes, or perfect strangers.
The only public fund for relief of the poor in this place, is the
Sabbath collections, which is distributed by the Session once in
the year, or in two years; and its annual amount is common-
ly from L. 3 to L. 4; but in times of a great herring fishing
it exceeds this sum, for many of the bounty fishers attend pub-
lic worship, too often for information where the fish abounds
most, than on account of devotion.  It is to be regretted, that the
toleration allowed by law to such men to prosecute their fishing
upon Saturday evenings and Monday mornings, is too often a-
bused by breaking the Sabbath rest.  Yet there are among them
who seldom or never send out any boats, either on the Saturday
evenings or Monday mornings, and yet they are known to
make out their cargoes as soon as the others, for, as they de-
clare themselves, their men exert themselves more vigorously,
in consequence of that rest, all the week over, so as to prove
more successful*.

Two of them have been used as cemeteries for burying the dead down to the
present times, which practice had its arise probably from their being a secu-
