  The above is only an estimated rental, taken from the heritors'
books, with one exception. Probably the real value is greater.
  The trap rocks in this district are often very remarkable.  Near
Smithston. by the road side, there is a greenstone in which the
rock assumes a columnar form. There is singular ridge of dioritic
whinstone at Mollinsburn, through which the new Kirkintilloch
road is cut. It runs east and west, and rises up so abruptly as to
resemble a great quartern loaf lying on a table. The place where
the above road passes, seems like a piece cut out of the loaf.
  As to the soils of this district, they are not generally so heavy
as farther south; they do not so decidedly incline to clay, and are
upon the whole more grassy. In the genuine coal-fields, grass is not
the favourite herb, but various species of ranunculus, yarrow,
daisies, and other insignificant weeds are very prevalent. The
bottom of the valley of the great canal is nearly all transported
soil. Near Auchinvole, and in several other places, there are bed
of water-formed sand of considerable thickness. The ground
along the southern part of the Kelvin is of a deep marshy nature,
and is often overflowed by the river, particularly near to the junc-
tion of the Luggie and Kelvin. The soil of a small trart to the
north-east angle is of a light reddish colour, upon a whinstone
and gravelly bottom. Around the town of Kirkintilloch, the soil
is a light black loam, 16 or 18 inches deep, on a reddish tilly bot-
tom. A strong natural clay prevails throughout the southern
and eastern, parts of the parish, where it comes more immediately
into contact with the genuine coal measures. Tracts of moss, af-
fording a black peat earth, are interspersed, here and there, through-
