church, with fines, and the annual rent of L. 65 of mortified
money, amount to about L. 18 yearly.  This, together with
the alms afforded by the householders, is amply sufficient
to supply the necessitous poor; but there is a vast influx of
vagrants and beggars from distant places, notwithstanding
the activity of the Justices of the Peace in sending many to
the house of correction at Dumfries.  Poors rates would be
an unnecessary and heavy burden on this part of the coun-
try.  The people are very liberal to their own poor, and
perhaps too much so to strangers.

   Heritors, Agriculture, etc.-There are only 4 small re-
siding heritors, with the numerous body of feuars and long
tacksmen in Lockerbie.  The great and non-residing pro-
prietors are the Duke of Queensberry, Earl of Hopetoun,
Earl of Mansfield, Lady Douglass of Killhead for Locker-
bie, Mr Harries of Hilldikes, and Mr Johnston of Barn-
gallhill, besides 6 small non-residing heritors.  There are
upwards of 60 farms from L. 25 to L. 100 rent, and some
few above that sum; the arable land is in general about
13 s. 4 d. the acre, and Highland pasture about 2 s. and
2 s. 6 d.  The inclosed parks around Lockerbie give from
17 s. 6 d. to double that sum of yearly rent.  The gross
rental of the parish is L. 3400, and the valuation is 7194 1/2
merks.  The crops are oats, barley, pease, potatoes, turnips,
flax, some hemp and rye, and wheat, with sown grasses in
rotation.  A considerable quantity of barley is exported at
port Annan from this parish to Whitehaven and Liverpool
for malting, also oats and potatoes.  A great many swine
are fatted and sold at the weekly market of Lockerbie du-
ring the season.  About 200 are annually fed in the parish,
from 10 to 20 stones each, and give from 3 s. 6 d. to 5 s. 6 d.
the stone, and cured and dried hams are about 6 d. the pound.
Farmers make their rents partly from their barley and ba-
