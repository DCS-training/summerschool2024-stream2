picturesque rocks, are beautiful seats; but both, as Leuchie, are
deserted by their respective respected baronets. This universal
absenteeism is universally felt as a severe bereavement.
   Occurrences.-In 1831, the Great Northern Whale, exhibited in
Edinburgh and elsewhere, as one of the most remarkable natural
phenomena, was discovered at sea a few miles hence, off the pro-
perty of Sea-Cliff, and brought to the beach at North-Berwick.
It had been dead for some weeks, and was partially emaciated
and corrupted. Its length was 78 feet. A vertical section of the
skull exhibited a part of its walls more than 3 feet in thickness.
The weight of the skeleton was 28 tons. The whale was sold by
public group for L. 37 only. The flesh and blubber were employ-
ed as manure. The skeleton was purchased for the trifling sum
of L. 10, by Dr Robert Knox of Edinburgh, who has since sold
it to the College Museum of the University of Edinburgh.
   In January 1832, the Asiatic cholera appeared in North-Berwick.
It was among the very earliest of its destructive appearances in Scot-
land, and in its commencement it was invariably fatal. There
were sixteen cases: the first seven died, the others all recovered,
Measures of arrestment and remedy were promptly adopted; and,
under the Divine Blessing, were successful. There has been no
return of this awful visitation.

            The population in 1755, was  -	1412
                              1791,      - 	1500
                              1801,      -      1583
                              1811,      -      1727
                              1821,      -      1694
                              1831,      -      1824

At present the amount is nearly the same as in 1831. The popu-
lation of the town, including the Wester Gate, may be stated about
1100, and of the country fully 700. There are several families of
independent fortune resident in the town.
   Games.-The prevailing popular game of the parish is the Golf,
for which the western links are peculiarly well adapted. The North
Berwick Golf Club was established on the 8th May 1832, and is
formed of noblemen arid gentlemen from all parts of the country.
The number of members is limited to 50, who are admitted by bal-
lot; one black ball excludes, and the ballot must take place in the
rotation of nomination, "before going to dinner." The regular meet-
ings are on the first Wednesday of May, June, July, and August.
The Captain is elected annually in August, and the rules of the
green are, with a slight exception, the rules of the Golf Club of St
