without obliging us to seek for its causes in those differences of
climate which are peculiar to each district in this extensivd parish.
  " The inequality between the males and females is no less strik-
ing. In the former, the deaths during four years were 197 ; in
the latter, 230, exclusive of children still-born. In the three years
previous to 1826, the number of female deaths, according to the
lists, was 157, or six less to the corresponding number of the other
sex; while in that year, in reality, they amounted to 73, or 39
more than the males. Of these, one-third took place below 10
years of age, and one-half below 30. This difference arises per-
haps from registration being neglected.
 " The proportion of deaths under 10 years of age in 1825 and
1826 in the parish, was, exclusive of 20 stillborn, as 104 to 257,
or I in 2.47, or about 40 per cent. of the whole deaths. From all
these facts, it is obvious that the probability of human life here is
not great, seeing that two-thirds of the whole population are cut
off below thirty years of age. The average of all the persons dying
here in 1825 and 1826, exclusive of still-born children, was as high
as 34.79.
 " Important differences also appear in the different classes of
which the population is composed;-the avera,,o,,e ages of the persons
belonging to the agricultural population dying in 1825 and 1826
being 60.05; the Scotch manufacturing population being 33.67,
whilst the Irish population was so lnw as 30.19." Yet in the upper
wards, many attain to a great age.
 Hydrography.-This parish, being inland, has no friths inter-
secting it; but it abounds with streams and springs of the purest
water. Some of these bubble up from the soil, others from the
solid rock. They are almost all perennial, though, in the end of
very dry summers, there is, in a few of them, a less abundant sup-
ply. At Neilston there are three wells on the grebe, one at the
Kirkhill, and one at the Butter Well, which have withstood the,
most prolonged droughts, and are of the finest water.
 The largest spring in the parish is that one " Aboon the Brae,"
which issues from the solid rock, discharging no less than 42 im-
perial gallons every minute, 2520 in the hour, or 60,480 a-day,
or 22,146,200 imperial gallons per annum. It is the chief spring
which supplies the Waterside Bleachfield, belonging to-Andrew
