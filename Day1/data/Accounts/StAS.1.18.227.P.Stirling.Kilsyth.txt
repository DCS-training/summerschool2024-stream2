erect a bridge across the Kelvin, at Auchinsterrie.  In these
papers the precise sum is stated, the name of the mason who
built the bridge, is likewise mentioned; and there are people
alive, who recollect to have seen a stone on the west edge of
the bridge, with the above date upon it.

   Lakes, Etc.-There are no natural lakes in this parish.
But the great reservoir above mentioned, is perhaps one of
the largest and most beautiful artificial sheets of water in the
kingdom.  It is of an oval form, fully three quarters of a
mile long, and somewhat less than half a mile in breadth; and
it covers upwards of 70 acres.  The country around it is
rugged and uneven, and gives the whole a romantic air.  A
few firs are planted at the east end, and in an island near
the west end of the lake.  They thrive very well, and add
variety and beauty to the whole.  The expence of this work
was very inconsiderable, in comparison of the surface and
quantity of water it contains.  It was originally an extensive
hollow, as if scooped out for the purpose, by the hand of
nature.  At one place only, there was a deep opening,
about 100 feet wide at the bottom, and 200 yards at the
top.  By filling this up to the heighth of about 25 feet, the
work was at once completed.  And by leaving a fluice in
the centre, it can be filled or emptied at pleasure.  The
whole is finished in a masterly and ingenious manner.
   This lake abounds with fish: and, if it were not occasion-
ally let out in the drought of summer to supply the great ca-
nal, it would furnish abundance of perch and trout at all
times, and of the very best quality.  The lade that runs from
it, and communicates with the canal, is one of the best
streams for trouting in the parish: but it is only a stream;
and therefore not to be compared with the river Carron.
This, in its whole extent, from its rise till it reaches the
