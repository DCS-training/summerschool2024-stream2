     of Inverkeithing.

   There is a tolerable schoolhouse, with a sufficient garden.
The present schoolmaster*, who is a very good scholar, has
been here upwards of 40 years; he draws an annual salary
of 200 merks Scots, paid by the town and heritors.  He is
also precentor and session clerk, for which he receives 28 l.
Scots, with the ordinary emoluments and dues belonging to
that office.  He teaches, besides the common branches of
education, the languages, navigation, and the other parts of
mathematics.  The number of scholars is about 50, being
commonly 40 in summer and 60 in winter.  There are seve-
ral private teachers besides.  The school wages are too low,
and by no means adequate to the teachers abilities and la-
bours; although as much as can be well afforded by the poor
part of the inhabitants.  The number of poor receiving pub-
lic charity; is not considerable.  Their funds were much dimi-
nished by the failure of a person who had their money in his
hands; and they now chiefly arise from the weekly collec-
tions at the church doors, which at present answer the de-
mands.

   Religious Persuasions.-Rather more than the half of the
inhabitants in the town and parish adhere to the established
church; the rest are Burghers, Antiburgers, Relief, and
Cameronians.  A Burgher, meeting house was built here about
40 years ago, occasioned by the settlement of the late incum-
bent, who, it seems, though a most worthy and respectable
character, was disagreeable to a great number of the parish-
ioners; it is mostly attended by the lowest part of the peop-
ple, and many of them come from the neighbouring pa-
rishes.  The Antiburghers and Relief are not numerous,
and attend their meeting houses in Dunfermline.  The Ca-
