   Village, Markets, etc.-It appears, from various deeds, that
the town and village of Clatt was erected into a burgh of ba-

heritable proprietor of the said burgh of barony, and markets
thereto belonging, being determined to give all proper en-
couragement to the said weekly markets and fairs, made pub-
lic intimation, in the Edinburgh and Aberdeen newspapers,
of his intention to improve the burgh, and revive and improve
the markets; and in the short intervals, in which he was per-
mitted to visit his estate here, he began to build better farm
houses; to form plans for improving and inclosing the grounds;
of raising flax, and introducing the linen manufacture, etc.
But, being soon after called abroad, on government service in
The West Indies, about the year 1784, his public spirited de-
signs were interrupted, and have not been resumed since, as
the Colonel died about three years afterwards.  By this fatal
event, Government lost an excellent officer, and experienced
engineer; and his tenants a good master, who wished to see
them thriving under him; and one who had the improvement
of his native country much at heart.
