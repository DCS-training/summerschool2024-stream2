augmentation of rents, a corresponding improvemnets, to say the
least, has not taken place in the condition of the inhabitants; nor
are the disadvantages under which the parish was found to labour,
to any extent remedied.  There are yet no roads, no adequate
means of religious or moral instruction, no resident medical prac-
titioner, no regular or steady employment for the people.  The
statement of these disadvantages will at once suggest remedial
measures.  The "sheep system," however, operates, and will
probably continue to do so, as a bar to agricultural and other im-
provements, and thus, under existing circumstances, there is little
prospect of seeing the condition of the people greatly ameliorated.
The conclusion, therefore, is reluctantly but maturely come to,
that every facility should be afforded to the poor in this and in
other parishes similarly circumstanced, of acquiring, in other re-
gions, the independence and comfort now unhappily denied them
in their native country.
