roll in the feed.  With this instrument one man may, with
great ease, sow ten acres in a day.

   Harrows, etc.-The harrows used here are of the com-
mon kind, with very little difference, only some lighter
and some heavier, but all of them have a cross spar fixed
upon one side, about 3 feet long, and about 6 or 8 inches
high, which they call a rider, and which prevents the har-
rows from overtoping one another, expecially in turning.  Mr
Paterson, some years ago, when the wheat feed time was very
rainy, got a beam 18 feet long, made to the breadth of the
ridges; upon each extremity of which he fixed an old fore-
wheel of a coach, and hung a set of harrows to the beam,
so as to take in the whole ridge at once; and to each end of
the beam attached 3 or 4 horses, to go in the furrows in a
line, by which the ground was completely harrowed, and
none of the feed trampled down with the horses feet.  This
he has used ever since, when a wet season makes it necessary,
and with great advantage, and several farmers have follow-
ed the example.  He also uses another harrow for his drill-
crops alone, and only when the ground is exceedingly foul
with couch grass.  It is about 2 feet wide, and 5 feet long,
with teeth set in diagonal lines, but so as to leave no part
of the surface over which it goes untouched.  On its fore-
part is a staple of iron, to which a swingle-tree and traces
are fixed for the horse; and to its hinder part a handle of
wood, about 4 or 5 feet long, rises up, and inclining a little
backwards; from the middle of which a light spur of iron
runs forwards, and is inserted into the harrow about its
middle.  The whole so contrived, that the man who drives
can easily guide it, press it down into the earth, or raise it
up, and leave the accumulated couch or weeds behind, at
pleasure.
