       ed to do so till the American war, which occasioned almost an en-
       tire stagnation of its trade." Accordingly, the population of the
       old and new parishes in 1781, is declared by Semple in his con-
       tinuation of Crawford's Renfrewshire, to be 12,000: in other wnrds,
       it had, according to that authority, more than tripled in twenty-six
       years. We think the number exaggerated. The births registered in
       1782, were 403, from which we should be inclined to infer that
       the population did not then exceed 10,000; at the same time, it
       must be admitted that the registration of births is so imperfect,
       that it scarcely affords ground for any certain conclusion. In
       1790, we find the births registered to be 508, indicating an addi-
       tion of one-fifth to the population, during the nine immediately pre-
       ceding years. An accurate enumeration of the inhabitants was
       taken in January 1792, from which it appeared that there were
       in the two parishes, 3387 families, or 14,299 persons, of whom
       6,766 were males and 7,533 were females. This enumeration
       was exclusive of seamen abroad at the time of the census; these
       included, the population had nearly quadrupled, from 1735 to
       1792.
          Since that period, the increase of the population, according to
       the Government census, is as follows:

                              Males.          Female.           Total.
          In 1801,            8,196           9,262            17,458
             1811,            7,978          11,064            19,042
             1821,            9:381          12,707            22,088
             1831,           11,973          15,598            27,571/2

        It is not easy to say how many ought to be added to each of
      the sums total in the numbers now given, on account of seamen,
      carpenters, coopers, and others on shipboard at the time of the
      enumeration. The amount differs by many hundreds at different.
      seasons of the year; but we shall not greatly err by taking it a
      2000, which, adiled to the population of 1831, makes the num-
      ber of males at the time of that census, 13,973, and the
      population, 29,571, or about fifteen times greater than is was at
      the commencement of last century.
          By the census in, 1831, there were in the three parishes into
      which Greenock was then divided, 6,353 families, distributed as
      follows:
