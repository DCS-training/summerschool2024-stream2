have levelled it with the ground. The walls were rent, the windows
shattered, and the roof demolished. A thick darkness, caused by
the smoke and dust, for a while concealed the extent of the mis-
chief. When it subsided, the neighbours who first entered, anxious
for the fate of their children, had reason to fear the worst; for few
signs of life appeared. The whole crowd of little ones, either stun-
ned or terrified, lay stretched upon the ground beneath the tables
or benches where they sat. Many were quite senseless, but after-
wards recovered. Two boys were killed outright, and the master
with many others much injured. The effect of such a scene is not
soon worn off from the minds of children. A black cloud still ter-
rifies the whole school, and a clap of thunder more than ordinarily
loud , scatters the whole little troop in an instant." Another instance
afterwards occurred. While a storm of thunder and lightning was
passing over the place, the family at the manse were alarmed, and
darkened the windows. The females crowded together in the
middle of the dining-room for shelter. One of the maids who bad
occasion to go up stairs, had no sooner got to the bottom of the
stair, than the lightning struck the house and killed her in an in-
stant. To prevent such fatal accidents in future, conductors were
placed upon the manse, and are still there.
