grate; and there are no ravages from any uncommon disor-
ders.  If, in Pensylvania, the population is doubled in 25,
20, or even 15 years, according to Dr Franklin; if, even in
Martinico in 1766, according to Raynal, the births were as
1 to 30 whites, and as 1 to 25 negroes, we might wish to
know what reasons can be assigned for the inferior, proportion
of births in a free and commercial empire; the learned and
philosophical will say, that the south is more favourable to
population, and the means of subsistence more easily pro-
cured.  But may we not suppose, that great inequality of
property, and accumulated taxes, are unfriendly to popula-
tion.  Perhaps the want of fuel in these islands is a particu-
lar reason; as Lord Kaimes supposes, that warm lodgings are
necessary to promote population, which the poor of these
islands have not.

   The number of marriages for the first period of 19 years,
that is, from 1748 to 1766 inclusive, is I79, which is, at an
average, 9 4/19 yearly.-The number of marriages for the se-
cond period of 19, that is, from 1771 to 1789, both inclu-
sive, is 170, which is, at an average, 8 8/19 yearly.  It is
to be remembered, that births and marriages are com-
puted only for the charge of Cross, Burness, and North
Ronaldshay, the population of which is 1353.-The number
of farmers in the isle of Sanday is 47.  The number of farm-
ers in the isle of North Ronaldshay is 44.  It must strike the
attention of the reader, that, in such a small isle as North
Ronaldshay, there should be nearly an equal number of farms
as in Sunday, although neither its extent or population is
above a fourth part of the isle of Sunday.  The largest farms
in this country are in the island of Sunday; and all North
Ronaldshay is parcelled out in small farms.
