     Statistical Account

is a large and commodious house.  The manse was complete-
ly repaired in 1791.  The situation has often been remarked
for its beauty.  The parish is 10 miles long, and 3 1/2 in
breadth.-Beside the legal schoolmaster, there are 4 public
teachers in the parish, two of whom have very good houses
built by subscription.  Though the abilities of the masters
are unquestionable, some of the schools are but thinly attend-
ed.  The boys and girls get wages for tambouring, sewing
muffin, &c. at so early a period, that there is great danger of
their education being neglected.  It is also worthy of obser-
vation, that, though this parish is in the vicinity of Glasgow,
very few young men belonging to it attend the University, or
prosecute any of the learned professions.  So soon as they
can write, and understand any thing of arithmetic, they ob-
tain good encouragement in the mercantile line, which they
naturally prefer to the more gradual and uncertain emolu-
ments of law, divinity, or physic.-Sunday schools seem not
to be unexceptionable institutions; for, how pious soever may
be the intention of their promoters, they undoubtedly weaken
the authority of parents, and tend to make them negligent in
their duty.-The poor are tolerably provided for.  None
beg; nor is there here any assessment.  The weekly collec-
tions, which may be about 35 L. per annum; the third part
of what is obtained at Shettleston Chapel, (which was built
partly to accommodate the west end of this parish), and the
interest of some stock, enable the session to give decent relief
to the distressed.  The various societies instituted among the
trades people, also afford assistance; and one cannot help re-
marking, that it is inexcuseable in heritors who do not re-
side, or do not attend the church, not to contribute to this
important purpose.  By this means an assessment might be
avoided, the consequences of which are always to be dreaded.
