   The Harbour.-What next merits particular notice, in this
place, is, the harbour, which certainly is one of the best in
Scotland.  By way of excellence it is called, in some of the
town's charters, Portus Gratia and Portus Solutis.  It is here,
that ships generally take shelter, when driven up by storms,
and hard gales of easterly wind.  It is easily entered, and af-
fords the greatest safety, let the wind blow from any quarter.
It is capacious, and of great depth of water.  The Cham-
pion frigate came lately in, with all her stores, and got as con-
veniently cleaned, as in a dock.  Much improvement might
still be made upon it.  Were the quays extended, ( which could
easily be done at no great expence ) small ships could come
in, and go out, at any time of tide.  In the opinion of profes-
sional men, docks ought to be establihed here, capable of re-
ceiving the largest ships of war.  This is surely an object, well
deserving the attention of government.  It might be done at a
small expence.  And, in the event of our ever being at war,
with our northern neighbours, would be a vast saving and con-
veniency; as the ships that happened to want cleaning and re-
pair, would not need to return to England for that purpose;
which they must always do at present.  Even for the ships that
are stationed in this Firth, and such as may occasionally come
into it, an establishment of this kind would be a great saving
of time and money.  Here too, houses and yards for the
King's stores might be had, much more conveniently, and at
far less expence, than at Leith.  They could be had at the ve-
ry entrance of the harbour, or along the quays.  As the houses
would be cheap, and the access easy, an annual saving
of some hundreds of poinds might reasonably be expected.
