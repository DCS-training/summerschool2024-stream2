   Situation, etc.-This parish is situated in the Presbytery
and County of Perth, and within the Synod of Perth and
Stirling.  It is of a very irregular form, being intersected in
different directions, for 3 or 4 miles, by the adjoining parishes
of Scone, St Martin's, and Kinfauns.
   That part of the parish which lies adjacent to the church
and manse, is beautifully situated, on the east side of the river
Tay, directly opposite to Perth, and is between a mile and a
half and 2 miles square; bounded on the north and northeast,
by the parish of Scone; on the southeast and south, by the
parish of Kinfauns; and on the west and southwest, by the
river Tay.  The disjoined districts of the parish will be best
known, by examining Stobie's map of Perthshire, under the
names, Inchyra, Balthayock, Murrays hall, and Balbeiggie.

   Soil, Culture, etc.-The soil of this parish is various.
Near the Tay, in some places, it is a strong clay, (particular-
ly at Inchyra), in some light and gravelly, and in others a good
loam, and some part of it has a tilly bottom.  Every fort of
soil has been greatly improved of late; many fields, which
formerly were barren and uncultivated, are now, by proper
culture and management, producing rich crops of all kinds of
grain.  The rapid progress of improvement here, as in most
parts of the country, within the last 20 or 30 years, has
raised the value of land amazingly; and were some of the pre-
sent leases expired, the rent of some farms would be more
than doubled.  The tops of the hills and such grounds as
were reckoned unfit for cultivation, are now covered with
thriving plantations; so that there is not much ware ground
in the parish.  The art of husbandry is now too well under-
