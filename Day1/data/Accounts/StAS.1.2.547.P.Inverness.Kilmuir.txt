     NUMBER XLVIII.

     PARISH OF KILMUIR.

     (ISLE OF SKY.)

     By the Rev. MR. DONALD MARTIN.

     Name, Situation, etc.

   THE ancient, as well as the modern name of this parish,
is Kilmuir, which, in Gaelic, signifies, the church of
Mary, to whom, at a very remote period, it had been dedica-
ted.-It is situated in the county of Inverness, in the island
and presbytry of Sky, and synod of Glenelg.-The form of 
the inhabited part of the parish is a semicircle, having within
it, the extremity of a ridge of mountains, which runs from
North to South, through this and two other parishes.  Its
length is 11 computed, or about 16 English miles; and its
breadth is supposed to be at least 8 English ones.  It is bound-
ed by the parish of Snizort on the south, and in every other
quarter, is surrounded by the sea.  The air is moist, but not un-
healthy; and the inhabitants are not subject to any peculiar
or epidemical disorders.  The nature of the soil, in general, is
a deep and fertile clay; but the reaping of the produce is ra-
ther uncertain, on account of the variableness of the climate.
