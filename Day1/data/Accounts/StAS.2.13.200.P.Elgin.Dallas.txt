   loft is required for 200 more. The sittings in the church are all free,
   and divided among the tenants; but, as the villagers are not includ-
   ed, a loft was fitted up for their accommodation by Sir William G.
   G. Cumming; but it is not sufficient to hold one-third of them. The
   manse, which was built in 1783, is situated a little to the north-west
   of the church, at the top of a beautifully inclined plain sloping to-
   wards the Lossie.  It is in very bad repair, and, owing to the mi-
   serable state of the interior, a new one is required immediately.
   The extent of the glebe, including the garden and lawn before the
   house, is about ten acres: its value about L. 12. The whole of
   the stipend, including money for communion elements, amounts to
   L.158, 6s. 8d. all paid in money, part of which is derived from the
   vicarage of Auldearn parish.

      The whole population, with very few exceptions, is connected
   with the Established Church.  Public worship is, in general, well
   attended.  About 400 or 500 attend every Sabbath, except when
   the river cannot be forded.  There are 170 communicants, of
