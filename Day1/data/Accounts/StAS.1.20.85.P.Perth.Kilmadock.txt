vate charity alone, which usually exerts itself in a most ef-
fectual manner; and the common poor should be provided
by the public.  It is an important matter to make charity
command gratitude and industry.  Private charity effects
this most completely: The indigent person knows that the
eyes of the donor is upon him, andthat if he is idle and in-
solent the donation will be withdrawn.  Hence, gratitude
excites his industry, and fear commands his respects.  But,
when a set of gentle beggars are put on the roll of hospital
pensioners, they conceive themselves only obliged to the
public, that is, nobody.  The funds, they say, are their
own, and they have none to thank.  Hence, they forget
their true situation, and become ungrateful, insolent, and
lazy.
   Let the parish of Kilmadock rejoice that she is free of
such nuisances; let her cultivate sobriety, industry, and vir-
tue, and, while prosperity smiles on her borders, affluence
will garnish her table, and contentment gladen her heart.

   Manufactures and Commerce.-This parish may be said
to be wholly destitute of any commercial traffic or regular
manufacture, except the Adelphi cotton-work.  A list of
the different tradesmen is given under the title population.
   For some time past Doune has been noted for excellent
slaters, who have acquired superior reputation in that trade
over all the neighbouring country, particularly Glasgow,
Hamilton, Dunbarton, etc. where they have been invited
to contract for all kinds of modern buildings, in preference
to the slaters of other places.  They work in these towns
during summer, and return to their families during winter;
and some of the more industrious among them learn other
trades, such as weaving, shoemaking, etc. which they prac-
tise when the season will not permit the work of slating.
