strength of the soil, and its northerly exposure; but when
the influence of the sun becomes more powerful, vegetation
is rapid, and the harvest seldom sails to be early.  It gene-
rally commences above the 20th of August, and is finished
about the 10th of October.

   Agriculture, &c:-The usual crops raised in this parish
are, barley, which is of the best quality, oats, pease, rye,
and potatoes; wheat also has been attempted with some
success, but for want of inclosures, and because what is sown
in the spring does not fill and ripen to perfection, some who
have attempted raising wheat, have discontinued it, finding
a barley crop almost equally profitable and far less scour-
ging to their fields.  The generality of farmers being poor,
and having no leases, never venture to roake improve-
ments in agriculture, or to deviate from the mode practiced
by their forefathers.-There is a great number of horses,
but, a few excepted, they are of a very trifling and diminu-
tive kind.  The farmers keep a great stock of black cattle,
which they employ in tilling their grounds; but it is sup-
posed that they shall soon be obliged to adopt a different
method; because great part of the Highlands, where their
cattle were wont to be grazed in the summer season, are
now converted into sheep farms, the number of which is
still increasing.  Some time ago, there was a considerable
number of sheep in this parish, but at present there are very
few; the grounds on which they were pastured being laid
under plantations of fir, to the no small loss of the farmers
in general, who are by this means deprived of many ad-
vantages which they derived from that useful animal; such
as, the best of manure for their fields, clothing for their
households, and some help annually to pay their rents. -The
valued rent of the parish is L. 4205, IX s. Scotch.  The
real rent, that of mills included, amounts to above 2000
