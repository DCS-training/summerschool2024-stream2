     Sacred to the memory of 
     Charles Earl of Elgin and Kincardine,
     who died the 14th of May 1771, aged 39 years.
     By the goodness of his heart, and the virtues of his life,
     He adorn'd the high rank which he possessed;
     In his manners amiable and gentle,
     In his affections warm and glowing;
     In his temper, modest, candid and chearful,
     In his conduct, manly' and truly honourable,
     In his character of husband, father, friend and master,
     As far as human imperfection admits,
     Umblemished.
     Pious without superstition,
     Charitable without oftentation.
     While he lived,
     The blessing of them that were ready to perish came upon him.
     Now
     Their tears embalm his memory-
     Reader,
     Beholding here laid in dust
     The remains,
     Which once so much virtue animated,
     Think of the vanity of life,
     Look forward to its end,
     And prepare as he did for eternity.
