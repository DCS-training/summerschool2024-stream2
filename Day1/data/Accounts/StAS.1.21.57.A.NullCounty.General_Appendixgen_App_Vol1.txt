things in question do not appear the same to you as they do to
me.  You make me speak a softer language respecting the coal
laws than I intended.  I used language which expressed the
feelings and sentiments of the people in my neighbourhood.
   In page 245 my meaning has not been discerned, and,
I fear, through my want of perspicuity.  You say, ' By ex-
'periment, it appears that plants which were pruned ad-

'were not pruned.'  My remark, if I remember well, is
confined to ashes, or to ashes and oaks; and instead of
pruning, I meant cutting them over, above the ground.  As it
stands in your page, pruning applies to firs, as well as ashes:
but, by cutting over a fir, it is commonly, if not always,
ruined.  I beg that you will be so good as to read that part
of my report, and to compare it with that which is printed.
It is of consequence for the public to know the advantages
which arise from cutting over oaks and ashes.  By cutting
over, I mean the same as taking off all that part of the
young tree which is above the ground.
