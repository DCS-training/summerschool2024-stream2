in this statistical report.  A bleachfield upon a small scale
gave way to this more important work on the site of it; and
additional ground having been procured, as well as ad-
ditional houses erected, the work already employs about
250 men, women, and children.  The spirit and success, with
which the business is here conducted, may be judged of by
the following instance: In the year 1793, when the general
stagnation of credit, and the want of market for cotton goods
in particular, induced many of the principal manufacturers,
either to dismiss a part of their working people, or to restrict
their employment to 3 or 4 days in the week, the managers
of this printfield, though then but an infant Company, re-
jected such an expedient, and at the same time adopted
another well worthy of being imitated, if the same necessity
should again occur.  Instead of dismissing any of their people,
or restricting their days of working, they made a small re-
duction, for the time, in the rate of wages, which enabled
them more easily to keep the usual number of hands in con-
stant employment; and while, in this way, the earnings of
the working people were less impaired, the full benefit of
their industry was preserved to the public, and the vices that
arise from idleness happily prevented.  This work derives
much advantage from the staple manufacture of the country
around being cloth of such kinds as are adapted to the pur-
pose of printing, and from a safe, regular, and expeditious
conveyance of goods to the London market, by means of the
small vessels that are employed in carrying salmon from the
port of Perth.  Besides these things, the whole country
around Perth affords peculiar encouragement to manufactu-
rers of every description, from the average prices of corn and
butcher's meat being here considerably lower than in the west
of Scotland, which is at present the principal seat of manu-
factures,-an advantage naturally derived from the superior
