yet it is certain that this statement is not extravagant.  But,
although sheep are evidently an object of so much importance
to the farmer, yet little regard has been hitherto paid to the
improvement of the breed.  Indeed, no experiment has ever
been made for this purpose.  They have been contented with
the breed which they found upon the grounds, which is cer-
tainly far from being good.  They are of a small species, with
black face and legs, and covered with wool of a very inferior
quality.  They are generally sold at three years old, at which

remarkably handsome.  They are short legged, deep in the
rib, broad over the loins, and, in general, without horns.
They weigh remarkably well to their apparent bulk.  The
bullocks and heifers bred in this parish are sold at three and

the Welsh, and Hebridian ponies, and are the ancient British
breed.  In the lower parts of the parish, where horses are
