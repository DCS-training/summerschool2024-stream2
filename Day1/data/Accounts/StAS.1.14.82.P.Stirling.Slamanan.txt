about half a mile W. from the other, and lies upon the
boundaries of this and the East Monkland parish runs
W.  It hath lately been made a reservoir to the great
canal between the Forth and Clyde, by the run of the
water of Calder, by which it is carried into the Monkland
canal, and from that, by a cut near Glasgow, conveyed
into the large canal.  There are some trouts in the wa-
ter of Avon, and also in the 2 Black Lochs, and some
perches and eels; but none, I believe, in the Ellridge
Loch.

   Valuation and Rent.-The valuation of the old parish,
in the cess-books, is 2349 L. 11 s. 7 d. Scots, and the annual
rent in the year 1771, was estimated at 1040 L. 5 s. Ster-
ling.  The valuation of the annexation is 1066 L. 13 s. 1 d.
Scots, and the annual rent, in the year 1771, was esti-
mated at 527 L. Sterling.  There are, at present, in the
parish, 28 residing and 25 non-residing heritors; and in
the annexation, 6 residing and 13 non-residing; so that
the whole number of heritors is 72.  The most of the
residing heritors farm their own lands, except a few, who
have considerable property; in which case, they let part
of it to tenants.  And these lands have been in possession
of the same families for many generations, perhaps since-
first feued out.

   Soil.-The arable lands on each side of the Avon, for
about half a mile, are of a light free soil; and, if proper-
ly prepared, would produce very good crops, almost of
any grain.  These are interspersed with haughs and mea-
dows, which are of a rich loamy soil.  The haughs pro-
duce good crops of oats, and the meadows very good
natural grass, which is made into hay, and is excellent
feeding for black cattle in winter.  Some of these lands
