materials, and the superiority of its workmanship, the stamp
of Aberbrothock is indebted for part of its same.  By in-
troducing honour as a prompter to excellence, the manu-
facture of Barrie has reached its present perfection.  For
more than 40 years, the inspection of the weaving, by the
unanimous consent of the manufacturers, has been assigned
to an annual officer, who is allowed to choose two assistant
counsellors.  The officer, with his assessors, are eagle-eyed
to discover every blemish.  A pecuniary sine, or what is
more dreaded, the correction of ridicule, overtakes every
one who is in fault.  These circumstances have contribu-
ted to six such habits of attention and accuracy, that in-
stances occur of workmen whose cloth has not been cast at
the stamp-office in a period of 20 years.  Exclusive of con-
siderable quantities of home-grown flax, the manufacturers
use yearly of foreign flax, from Riga and Petersburgh, se-
veral tons, amounting in value to more than L. 800.  The
manufacturers are in number 100.  The condition of this
useful class of men might be ameliorated, by insuring to
them at all times abundance of flax at a reasonable rate, by
continuing the encouragement on the linen branch, and by
rescuing the manufacturers from a twofold combination of
the brown linen merchants, by which they enhance at
pleasure the price of the foreign flax they sell, and depress
the price of  the cloth they buy. 

   Population.-At the time of Dr Webster's report, the
