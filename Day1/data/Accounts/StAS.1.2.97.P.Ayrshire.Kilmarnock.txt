nearly L. 5400 sterling; which is, at an average, above 18 s
per acre.  Some particular farms are let considerably higher,
at 25 s or 26 s, and one at 36 s, and small inclosures near the
town from 50 s to L. 4 per acre; while those at greater distance
from the town, and near the muirs, are sometimes as low as
12 s.  The rent of the different lands in the parish, however,
has lately been brought much nearer a level than formerly,
by the good roads that are now made through the whole of it.
About 20 years ago, Mr Orr of Barrowfield, who was pro-
prietor of a large estate at a distance from the town, and
nearest the muirs, seeing the importance that good roads
would be of to his estate, was at a great expence in opening a
communication with the high-ways, leading to Glasgow and
other towns, as well as in making several other valuable and im-
portant improvements; in consequence of which, his property
has become as valuable as any in the neighbourhood; and
some of the farms on that estate, are amongst the highest
rented of any that are in it.

   Soil and Mode of Inclosing.-There is not much difference
of soil throughout the parish.  In general, it is a strong
rich soil, consisting of clay, with a mixture of sand, and
near the muirs some moss.  There are some find holms along
the side of the Irvine, consisting of sand and fine loam,
brought down by the river and left on its banks after floods.
It is a great detriment to the grounds in this parish, as well as
in the greater part of Ayrshire, that the bottom is a strong
till, almost impenetrable by water; reaching, in general, 30
or 40 fathoms deep, or even more, while the soil on the sur-
face, is little more than a foot, merely what the plow has re-
peatedly turned up to the influence of the weather.  The 
consequence of this is, that the autumnal rains, which fall pe-
culiarly heavy in the western parts of the kingdom, having no
