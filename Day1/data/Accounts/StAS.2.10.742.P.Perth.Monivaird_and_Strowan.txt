               crease was 415, exhibiting a total decrease of 850 from 1755 to
               1833, or during seventy-eight years.  This extraordinary de-
               crease of population is to be ascribed, in a great measure, to the
               extent to which the practice of consolidating the pendicles of cot-
               tars and small farms into larger ones, has prevailed in these as in
               many other parishes, during that period.
                  There are in these parishes only two small hamlets each con-
               taining about half a dozen houses, and the rest of the population
               is considerably scattered.
