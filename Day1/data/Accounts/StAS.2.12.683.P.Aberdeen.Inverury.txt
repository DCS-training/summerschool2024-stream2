who held the forbidden General Assembly at Aberdeen in 1606.

                          III-POPULATION.
   The population continued pretty stationary during last century,
and, at the beginning of this, was not above 500.  By the census
of 1831, it was 1419; and, according to that completed in 1841,
it is 2020.  This great and rapid rise has taken place within the
burgh, which now contains 1619 souls.

                          IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Placed as the terminus of an extensive, naturally fertile, and
rapidly advancing agricultural district, this parish has attracted
merchants, artisans, and additional labourers, in order to sup-
ply the wants of an industrious and thriving tenantry.  But the main
cause of the increase and prosperity of Inverury is, without ques-
tion, the Aberdeen Canal, which has conferred on it many of the
advantages of a sea-port.  This patriotic undertaking was supported
chiefly by the landholders, through whose property it passes, and those
of the Garioch.  The Inverury Port (deservedly called Port El-
phinstone, from the encouragement which Sir Robert Elphinstone
gave to the canal), exhibits a scene not unlike the quays at Aber-
deen; hundreds of carts, sometimes, in a day, delivering grain,
and carrying away coals, lime, bones, dung, bricks, iron, timber,
or other materials for house-building.  For many years, the be-
nefits of the canal were comparatively unappreciated, and perhaps
the carriage rates were injudiciously high; at least, since they were
lowered from one third to one-half, about ten years ago, the increase
of traffic has been very remarkable, as the following tables show :
