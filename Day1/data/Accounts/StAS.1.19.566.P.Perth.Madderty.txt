been an island surrounded by the water of the Pow.  In
Latin it is denominated Insula Missarum, which is said to
be a literal translation of its common name, Inch-effray, for
Inch-peffray, the Island of Masses, or the island where mass
is said.  It was endowed with many privileges and immu-
nities by David and Alexander Kings of Scotland.  The
edifices of this Abbey, which were once extensive, are now
in ruins, and have, on several occasions, supplied abund-
ance of stones for building houses, and making roads in the
neighbourhood.  The few remains of this ancient Abbey,
with 6 or 7 acres of land in the immediate vicinity, belong
to the Earl of Kinnoul, who, in consequence of this com-
paratively small possession, is patron of about twelve parishes
that formerly were attached to the Abbey.  Mauritius,
abbot of this place, was present with Robert the Bruce at
the battle of Bannockburn, and is reported to have had
brought along with him the arm of St Fillan.  This relick
might, indeed, have given some encouragement to the su-
perstitious; but one arm of a brave Scotsman, fighting in
earnest for the liberty of his country, had more effect in ob-
taining that memorable victory, than could have been pro-
duced by the inate virtue of all the relicks of the dead that
could have been collected.  "James Drummond, a younger
"son of David Lord Drummond, and his Lady, a daughter
" of William Lord Ruthven, was first styled Lord Inchafry,
" being Commendator of that Abbacy, and afterwards
" created Lord Madderty by King James VI. in the year
" 1607.  He married Jean, daughter to Sir James Chis-
" holme of Cromlicks, and with her got the lands of Inner-
" pefry, which were her mother's portion, being heiress of
" Sir John Drummond of Innerpefry.  He had, by his said
" Lady two sons, John Lord Madderty, and Sir James, the
" first Laird of Machony."-Nisbet's Heraldry, vol. 1.
