   Church.-The church and manse were originally situated
at the extremity of the parish, to the west; which being very
incommodious, they were, in the year 1689, built near the bridge
of Earn, and are now about the centre of the parish.  The pa-
rishioners still continue to occupy the old burying ground;
and none bury in the ground about the present church.  There
was formerly a chapel at Moncrieff, and a church at Kirkpot-
tie, both appendages of the church at Dumbarny.  The for-

latter is long since in ruins:  and the estate of Kirkpottie, and
other lands, belonging to the parish of Dumbarny, were, in
the year 1652, annexed, quoad sacra, to the parish of Dron,
being at a great distance from the church of Dumbarny.  The
Magistrates and Town Council of Edinburgh are patrons of
the church, and titulars of the teinds of the parish of Dumbar-

and the vicarage teind, 4 chalders of victual, whereof there
are 40 bolls of meal, and 24 of bear, besides 40 L. Scotch for
communion elements.

Church, and by an uncommon harmony at the settlement of
their ministers.  This harmony has, in a great measure, pro-
ceeded from the moderation and good sense of the patrons,
who have always exercised their right, in a way that was
agreeable to the heritors; and they, on the other hand, have
uniformly consulted the peace of the parish, in their applica-
tions to the patrons; an example to other patrons and he-
ritors, well worthy of imitation.  By such moderation, the
settlement of most parishes would be peaceable; an object cer-
