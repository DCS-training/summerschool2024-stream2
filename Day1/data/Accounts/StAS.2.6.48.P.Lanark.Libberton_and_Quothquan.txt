--L. 1, 16s. There is less disposition among the poor to refrain
from seeking parochial relief than formerly, nor do they now con-
sider it so degrading.
	Fuel.--The fuel chiefly used is coal, procured either from the
parish of Douglas, at the distance of ten miles, or from Cleugh, in
the parish of Carnwath, nine miles distant from the church town of
Libberton.

			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	As a proof of the great rise in the value of land in this parish
within these last thirty or forty years, the property of Whitecastle,
situated in the most elevated district of the parish, was purchased
about forty years ago, for about L. 2700; and it has yielded an an-
nual rent, for these nineteen years past, of L. 283, which is not ac-
counted too high. About thirty-two years ago, a property was
purchased for the same sum, in the southern district of the parish;
the annual rent of which is now L.345.
	It may be added, that the farmers labour under great disadvan-
tages from their high rents, the difficulty of communication with
good and ready markets, and their liability to have their crops of
corn and potatoes injured by frosts in autumn; in consequence of
which they have not only a deficiency of produce, but are obliged
to purchase their seed at a dear rate from a distance. In certain
districts, chiefly the poorest, and most elevated of the parish, there
is a disease incident to cows called the stiffness, the cause or cure
of which has never yet been well ascertained, but which generally
proves fatal to its victims. It is a general wasting, or atrophy,
which attacks cattle in the spring or winter months, and reduces
them to skeletons. Their only chance of recovery is in their re-
moval to a richer pasture, before the disease has far advanced.
