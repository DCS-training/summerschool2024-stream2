   This parish likewise contains some Druidical circles, and
the appearance of a Roman encampment.  This last is situ-
ated on a moor, between the bridge of Spey and Pitmain;
and is said by many who have examined it, to shew several
of the lines of a camp perfectly distinct and entire.  Appear-
ances of this kind are often so little to be depended on, that
every opinion concerning them should be hazarded with un-
common diffidence.  Collateral circumstances, however, in
this case, may add a degree of probability to conjecture.  In
clearing some ground adjacent, an urn was found full of 
burnt ashes, which was carefully preserved, and is still ex-
tant.  A Roman tripod was also found some years ago, con-
cealed in a rock; and is deposited in the same hands with
the urn.  These are strong presumptive proofs, that the Ro-
mans had carried their arms far beyond Agricola's wall; the 
Celtae never burned their dead; nor was the tripod ever used
in their libations.

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-In concluding this superficial de-
scription, the writer has only farther to observe, that he has
endeavoured to give a faithful statement of particulars, as 
they appeared to him, without any bias or partiality. That 
the peasantry in this, as well as in different other districts of
the Highlands, suffer uncommon hardships, and are less
comfortable than their southern neighbours, none who have
attentively examined their condition, will venture to deny.
But it is easier to enumerate grievances, than to point out
the means of redress.  Were the proprietors to grant them
their lands rent-free, it could not answer the purpose at pre-
sent.  Improvements in Agriculture are slow and progres-
sive; an influx of wealth, and a liberal patronage, may en-
courage individuals to make uncommon exertions for a time;
but till a partial change shall be effected in the dispositions
