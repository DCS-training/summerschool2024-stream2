upon an eminence, at the head or north end of the town.
It is a neat edifice, handsomely fitted up in the inside, and
may contain about 750 people.  It was built in the year
1757, being at that time removed from Dryfeside, 1 1/2 mile
north of Lockerbie.  It is said, that in the year 1670, Dryfe
swept away the original church and burying ground, which
was in the middle of the holm, now called the Sand Bed;
after this, in 1671, the late church and burial ground was
established at a small distance, and upon the skirt of the
present glebe, or Kirkhill, thought to be perfectly secure
from the swells of Dryfe; but the water in process of
time, approached the new burying ground, carrying a good
deal of it away, and threatening the church itself, verifying
the old saying or prophecy of Rymer,

     "Let spades and shoels do what they may,
     "Dryfe will have Dry'sdale kirk away."

Partly from the above circumstances, but principally
through the influence of the family of Lockerbie, the church
was removed to the town, for the ornament and conveni-
ence of the place and parish.  There is an Antiburgher meet-
ing house at the south or foot of the town, established about
50 years since, the only one in Annandale, and draws only a
moderate congregation and annual income from the whole
dale.

   Lakes, Cleughs, or Glens.-Turnmcor Loch affords a suffi-
cient quantity of water for supplying the corn and barley
mills of that name, but hath nothing peculiar, excepting its
being an excellent haunt for wild ducks, geese, and other
fowls in the winter-season.  The Cauldron is a very deep
lake in the midst of a morals, never freezing, abounding
with pike and eels, being the remains of the old water-gate
