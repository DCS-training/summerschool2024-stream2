their infield is generally managed: and it is a pity the dis-
tinction were not abolished, for the soil of their outfield is
naturally the same with that of their infield; and after it is
ameliorated by two or three potatoe crops, the difference is
no longer known.
   The outfield ground is commonly laboured for oats two
years, and then laid ley one year.  No manure is bestowed
on it.  This may be considered as shameful in parishes where
there is not a stone but what is lime, and where there is a
sufficient quantity of fuel to burn it; but while lime is sold
from 10 d. to 1 s. the barrel, it is not to be supposed that
much of it will be used to the purpose of enriching the soil.
The manure made for their infield ground is rich and strong.
   Instead of carrying the dung daily from the byres, it is
allowed to remain there as long as there is room for it, and
is every day mixed and covered with black mould brought
from the hills.  After the byres are full, and the cattle
raised to the very roof, the whole mixture is carried to the
dunghill; and then the operation within begins and goes on
daily as before.
   There are 78 ploughs in these parishes, each drawn by
4 oxen going abreast, with heavy wooden yokes across their
necks.  The Shetland plough is single stilted; and is said to
be the same used in the cultivated parts of Norway.  The
implements of husbandry are generally bad.  The harrows
are light, and mostly timber teethed.  For this reason, the
plough is always followed by 3 or 4 people, with spades in
their hands, doing what might be done to more purpose, and
at less expence, by the single draught of a sufficient harrow.  The
corn hooks are so very small, that the shearer who cuts 2
thraves of the thickest corn in a day, is hard wrought.  The
manure is carried from the dunghill on horses, and every
horse must have his leader; though no place is better calcu-
