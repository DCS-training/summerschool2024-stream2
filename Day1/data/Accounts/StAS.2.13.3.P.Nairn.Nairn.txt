     The agricultural improvements keep pace with those common in
   the north of Scotland.  Mr Mackintosh of Geddes is the greatest
   improver of land, having all his property in the best state of cultivation,
   and raising grain of superior quality.
     The chief improvements in the parish, for many years past, have
   been made by William Mackintosh, Esq. of Geddes.  When hd
   succeeded to that property, in November 1822, he found the
   arable fields in the late proprietor's own possession, in the best state
   of cultivation; but those in the possession of tenants, in the worst
   and most unproductive state possible. The home-farm, however,
   consisted only of about 60 acres; and the rest of the property was
   let to five small tenants, in farms from 40 to 100 imperial acres to
   each, exclusive of pasture. To the south, and immediately in
   front of the mansion house, is a large hill, called the hill of Urchuny,
   which at that time was a common between the neighbouring
   proprietors on both sides of it, but totally unproductive, and
   at the same time a very ugly feature in the country. As soon as the
   present proprietor got possession,, it immediately became an object
   with him to improve the property in all its parts; and he accordingly
   applied to the neighbouring proprietors to have the hill divided,
   and fortunately succeeded. This being done, he commenced
   planting his proportion with larch, oak, and some Scotch or trees; the
   other proprietors immediately following his example; so that the
   hill, which was formely an eye-sore, is now an ornament in this part
   of the conntry.  The proprietor of Geddes has also planted about
