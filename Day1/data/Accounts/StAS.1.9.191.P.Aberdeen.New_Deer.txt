rivulets, sufficient for driving mills and light machinery,
are very plenty.  There are also some chalybeate wells,
but none of these have attained to any great repute.  On
a farm in the head of the parish there are 3 contiguous
springs; which run in as many different directions.  One of
them runs eastward, increasing considerably in its course,
till it joins the water of Strichen.  These form the water
of Ugie, which falls into the sea at Peterhead.  Another
of them runs southward into Ythan, and falls into the sea
at Newburgh.  The third runs N.W. into Doveran, and
falls into the sea at Banff.  This is the circumstance above
alluded to, and from which we inferred the height of the
parish.-Remains of several Druidical temples are to be
seen.  The place where one of them stood is about half a
mile N. from the church, and still retains the name of
"standing stones." In view of this, and about a mile from
the church, directly S. there was another.  This is not yet
all removed, and the former was but lately taken away, to
lay the foundation of the present manse.  There are also
several tumuli or small cairns, some of which have been
dug up, and found to contain urns inclosed in stone coffins.
The coffins were composed of flags of stone from 3 to 4
feet long, and so closely laid together, that no dust could
penetrate.  The urns, which to the eye appeared quite
found, but mouldered at a touch, were placed near one of
the corners, and contained fragments of human bones and
ashes.  About 2 miles north from the church stands an
o1d castle, called Fedderatt, which appears to have been a
place of considerable strength.  It is surrounded partly by
a fosse, and partly by a morass, so that there could have
been no access to it, but by a causeway (which is still vi-
sible) and a draw-bridge.  Water, it seems, had been con-
veyed to it by means of pipes; for pieces of them have,
at different times, been torn up by the plough.  Accord-
