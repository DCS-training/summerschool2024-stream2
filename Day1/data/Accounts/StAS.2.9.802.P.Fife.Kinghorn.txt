     Climate.-The town and parish of Kinghorn are remarkably
healthy. The town is situated on a dry bed on the side of the brae,
with an abundance of rivulets rushing down the declivities to carry
away at once, into the sea, everything that might otherwise lie to
oppress the atmosphere with unhealthy vapours. Old age finds
here a healthy resting-place. Several persons in it at present are
upwards of ninety years of age.
     Hydrography.-There are various springs of excellent quality in
and around Kinghorn. One of these, about half a mile to the west-
ward on the shore, has long been known for its medicinal qualities.
The celebrated Dr Anderson, of pill notoriety, and physician to
Charles I., wrote a treatise on this water in 1618, and recommended
its use for allaying inflammations, external and internal, and for re-
moving difficulty in breathing and other maladies. It is im pregnat-
ed, he says, with crystal, gypsum, and nitre, and acts as a powerful
diuretic, while it produces the most invigorating effects upon debili-
tated donstitutions. This he was enabled to state from observa-
tion, as he attended patients while using it, and gave directions in
what manner the most salutary effects might be obtained from it.
It is to be lamented, that the efficacy of this formerly noted spa
has not been sufficiently appreciated of late years.
     Kinghorn Loch lies a little to the north-west of the town.
It covers a surface of twenty acres, is thirty feet deep, and is em-
bosomed amid finely undulating hills. The inhabitants have an
abundant supply of water from it, by pipes laid through the streets.

of the guage, and the winds which prevail on the island.
