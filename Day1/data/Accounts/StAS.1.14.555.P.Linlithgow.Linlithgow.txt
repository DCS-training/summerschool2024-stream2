this kind is the more laudable and requisite, as the educa-
tion of the lower classes s is unhappily neglected; and
though other circumstances may concur to increase the
depravity of the times, it certainly originates in the want
of these early impressions of God and a future state, which
only can effectually bind the conscience, and regulate the
life*.

   Printfield.-In 1786, the calico-printing business was
begun upon the river Avon, about a mile W. from the
town, and carried on to a considerable extent, till towards
the close of the year 1792.  The number of persons then
employed in it was 200; but they are now reduced one
half.  The present director was formerly engaged in some
of the extensive operations on the banks of the Leven,
and pleases himself with the idea of the speedy revival of
this and other branches of trade.
   The bleachful, which bears the name of the town,
though now removed at a considerable distance from it,
lies also on the side of the Avon.  Part of the machinery,
which is said to be of a new and improved construction,
is in the county of Stirling, separated from the field only
by the river.  Mr. Reed, the conductor of this work, in-
vented the watering machine, which is found so useful in
the west country; and also contrived a new species of
pump, less subject to friction than the common one.  He
has some other improvements in view, which he means to
submit to the publick.

*Small attempts in the cotton line were lately made, but without
success.  Some gentlemen from Glasgow, in summer 1792, had project-
ed a great work of this kind, and found a station, very fit for the pur-
pose, within half a mile of the town; but as they could not agree with
the tenant about the value of his lease, the scheme was then dropped;
nor have circumstances since been so favourable to commercial enter-
prise.
