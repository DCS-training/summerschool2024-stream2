                    PARISH OF SOUTH KNAPDALE. *

               PRESBYTERY OF INVERARY, SYNOD OF ARGYLE.

               THE REV. ALEXANDER MACKENZIE, MINISTER.

                   I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-In Gaelic " Knap" means hill, and " Daill" a plain,
a field, or a dale.  " Knapdale," therefore, signifies a disrict of
country composed of hills and dales.
   The name is derived from, and is very descriptive of, the ap-
pearance of that part of the country of which South Knapdale
forms a portion.  The district of Knapdale is divided into two pa-
rishes, the one north, the other south, to distinguish them accord-
ing to their relative geographical position.
   Boundaries.-South Knapdale is bounded on the north by
North Knapdale; on the north-east, by Kilmichael Glassery and
Lochgilphead ; on the east and south-east, by Lochfine, East Loch
Tarbert, the irthmus of Tarbert, and West Loch Tarbert ; on
the south by the parish of Kilberry.; and on the west, by the
Sound of Jura.
   Extent.-From Daill on the north-east, to Barnellan, on the
south-east, the length, by following the line of the public road,
is about 24 miles.  From Lochfine to Lochsween, the breadth of
the parish is about 10 miles, so that the superficial extent may
be computed at 240 square miles ; of this surface, however, a
space of 80 square miles or thereby is occupied by Lochcaolis-
port, leaving an area of about 160 square miles.  As there has
been no regular survey of the parish, this is merely an approxima-
tion to the true extent.
   Topographical Appearances.-The surface of the parish is ex-
tremely hilly, approaching rather to the mountainous.  The hill
Of Lliabh Goail, which extends from Inverneill to Barnellan, a
distance of twelve miles, is the highest in the parish.  The view
from its summit is varied, extensive, and interesting.  No
