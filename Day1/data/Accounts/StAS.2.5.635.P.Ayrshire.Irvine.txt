This was done in May 1784; but the woman soon died, and the
establishment being broken up, the imbecile fanatics, who had fol-
lowed her, returned to their former places of abode. Mr White
was deposed in 1783, and Mr Peter Robertson was ordained as
pastor of the Relief chuch in 1784. During his ministry, the
building was enlarged; and Mr Robertson died on the 30th Ja-
nuary 1819. He was succeeded by Mr Archbald M'Laren, who
was ordained on the 23d March 1820, and died on Saturday, 11th
September 1841.
  Dr James Richmond, author of the former Statistical Account
of Irvine, died in 1804, and was succeeded by Mr James Hender-
son, who died in 1820. The present incumbent was admitted to
his charge on the 22d June of that year. Up to 1785, the sti-
pend of this parish was seven chalders of victual, chiefly meal, and
near L. 100 Scots. The augmentation granted at that time was
L. 400 Scots. The last augmentation was granted on the 19th
June 1816, and commenced with crop 1816. As then granted,
the stipend consists of 18 chalders of victual, with L.10 Ster-
ling for communion elements. Originally, the glebe was about
one and a-half acres, but subsequently an addition was made to it
of six and a-half acres. The manse, which is commodious and
handsome, was built in 1820.
  The Secession congregation in this place was formed in the
year 1800; and in 1808, they called the Rev. Alexander Camp-
bell, and he was then ordained among them as their first minister.
The place where they assembled for public worship at that time
was found inconvenient, and the building of their present place of
worship was commenced in 1809, and was opened in January
1810. It is a neat and commodious chapel, and seated for 800.
  A small place of worship was opened by the Baptists in the
year 1803, under the direction of the Rev. George Barclay, their
first minister. He died in 1838, and ws succeeded by his son-
in-law, the Rev. John Leechman, A.M. Having sold their for-
mer chapel, Mr Leechman and his friends erected another more
commodious and more conveniently situated. It is fitted up to
hold 600 persons.
  Hamil's hill chapel, built in 1836. The Rev. Robert Smith,
minister. Seated for 350 persons. In government, the church is
congregational-and in opinion, it is distinguished by holding the
universality of the atonement, the pre-millennial advent of the
Lors Jesus Christ, and his personal reign.
