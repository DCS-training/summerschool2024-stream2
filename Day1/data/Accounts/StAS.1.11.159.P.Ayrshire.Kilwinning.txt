of the population of this parish, was              2541 Souls.

   These are all of the establishment, except 222 Antiburgher
Seceders, a few families of Burghers, and an equally small
number of the Relief persuasion.  There are no Episcopalians
nor Roman Catholics.  From the most unquestionable tradi-
tion, it appears, that, about 50 years ago, the country parish
was considerably more populous than it is now.  The causes
of this decrease in the population seem to be the three fol-
lowing:- 1st, The union of two or more small farms into one
large farm.  This has happened in not a few instances. 2 dly,
The barony of Eglintoune, formerly one of the most populous
quarters or divisions of the parish, is inclosed and farmed by
Lord EGLINTOUNE, and inhabited only by a very few families
of his Lordship's servants. 3 dly, The almost total want of
cottagers.  Every farm had formerly one or two, or more of
these families upon it.  The cottages are now, in a great mea-
sure, demolished; and this numerous and industrious class of
people has been under the necessity of removing to Irvine,
and to the other towns in the neighbourhood.  From the want
of trade and manufactures, very few of them settled in Kil-
winning.  Owing to the rapid progress of manufactures, how-
ever, the population in the town has, for some years past, been
on the increase.  From the spirit of industry and enterprise
universally spread through the country, there is every degree
of probability, that these will make a still more successful and
extensive progress; and that the population will proportionably
increase.
