chalder of lime; the lime is burnt chiefly in small kilns, hold-
ing from 10 to 15 chalders, the stone being more complete-
ly burnt, than in those of a larger size; the layers of stone
and coal are made alternately in the following proportions:
1 ft, Six inches of coal, then 20 inches of lime-stone, broken
to the size of a two-penny-loaf.  Two firlots (wheat mea-
sure) of burnt stone make four firlots of slacked lime; of
course, 32 firlots make a chalder of lime, sold, till within
these two years, at 4 L. Scots, at the quarry, now, 8 s. the rea-
dy money price; formerly it was sold with at least 6 months
credit.  It is doubtful if the state of the country as yet will
permit this alteration, small as it is; it requires 6 or 7 loads
of coal to burn the chalder of lime.  There were employed
this summer (1793) 40 workmen in the different lime quar-
ries in the parish, who raised at least 3000 chalders of
stacked lime; the Campsie lime is reckoned of an exceeding
rich quality, much fought after by plaisterers; in common
building, to every boll of lime one boll of sand is required,
to make proper mortar.  The great facts relative to our coal
and lime work, are stated in the following table:
