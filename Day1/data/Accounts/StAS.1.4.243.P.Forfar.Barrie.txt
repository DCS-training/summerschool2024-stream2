markably bloated and discoloured, and in a very short time
becomes a carrion.  The experience of an aged man, who
for many years was a sheep-master in the parish, affords
some presumption, that a preventative may be found to the
bracks.  He let blood of his sheep uniformly in the sum-

   Remarkable Objects and Antiquities.-In the southern ex-
tremity of the parish, on the banks of the Tay, stand 2 re-
flecting light-houses reared to direct the vessels trading to
Dundee and Perth through the perilous entrance of the
Tay.  The largest, which is stationary, is a circular stone

one, the pilot may navigate the river without fear.  The
expence of the lights is desrayed by a small tax on the ton-
nage of the vessels which enter the Tay.-The Danes seem

an adjoining estate, the vicinity of a brook, which is said
to have run three days with blood, proclaim these tu-

the desperate engagement, which, according to Buchanan,

Danish troops commanded by Camus, and the Scotch army
under King Malcolm II.

   Roads and Bridges.-The roads have at no time been
much indebted to the improvement of art.  The post-road
between Dundee and Aberbrothock, which for a long pe-
