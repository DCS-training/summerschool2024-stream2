season.  There is a traditionary account here, that this
house was intended as a place of retreat for Mary Queen of
Scots and Bothwell from the then prevailing disturbances;
but upon Mary and Bothwell's defeat, the castle of Nolt-
land, and some adjoining lands, were granted to a gentle-
man of the name of Balfour, who put the Balfour's arms
on this house.  This gentleman was either a brother, or
near relation of a Sir James Balfour, who was Governor of
the Castle of Edinburgh at that time.  Though this castle

   In several places along the shores of the island of West-
ray you meet with graves, which are certainly of a very
ancient date.  On the north-west shore of this island, and
not far from the house of Trenaby, some of these graves
were opened a few years ago, and among the ashes were
found one or two short sabres or swords, which were per-

how these bodies came to be lodged in this place, at such a
distance from the common place of interment, is not easy
to conjecture.  But when speaking of these things, the mi-
nistier of Westray must take notice, that there are two re-
markable graves by the sea-shore, at half an English mile
from the manse.  The one of these graves is large, the
other of a small size; the latter, which is at some distance
from the larger grave, is placed within a small circle of
stones, which is equal with the surface of the grave.  The
position of these graves is from N. to S. with four grey
stones set on edge, and placed at equal distances from one
