hedging, inclosing, trenching, with a thousand et ceteras, is
endless.  I have known the first crop, of little more than
half an acre, cost the improving proprietor above 20 L.  How
can a poor tenant imitate this?  He will laugh at what he
considers the enthusiasm that leads to it, and it will rivet his
prejudices against improvement.
   An intelligent actual farmer, whose bread depends upon
his industry, and who is little removed from their own sphere

for improvement?  How can that man embark in any plan
for ameliorating his farm, who knows that he only hangs
out a bait for the grasp of avarice, and that ingenuity and
industry tend only to ruin him?  It is to be hoped that the

be more generally adopted in ours, and that the proprietors
will delight in receiving "the blessing of them that are ready
"to perish;" the just recompence gratefully paid to the lord
of their manor, by industrious, flourishing, useful members
of society, and accompanied, let it not be thought of little
value, by their prayer for his enjoying the blessing of the
