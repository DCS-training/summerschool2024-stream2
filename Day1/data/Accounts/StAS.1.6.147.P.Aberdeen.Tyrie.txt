often exert themselves to get other farms annexed to their
own, there is some cause to fear the misfortune which Pliny
complained of, when he says, that large farms had ruined Ita-
ly, and now even the provinces.  The antients said it down
as a maxim, that the size of farms should be particularly at-
tended to, seeing that it is most adviseable to sow little and
plough well.-A barren spot, on which industry is excited by
means within the reach of many, will soon be cultivated by
the constant labours of the many.  As on large farms few of
the servants are in such easy circumstances as to be induced to
marry, a want of hands must be soon felt; and this want is at
the present time severely felt in this part of the country.  Small
farms being within the reach of many, are a temptation to
many to settle, to encrease and multiply.  If considerable
owners of land could be induced to divide large farms among
a number of industrious husbandmen, the waste lands would
be improved, the rents greatly augmented, and the number
of industrious people greatly increased.  A division of large
farms is very practicable in this parish, because it contains such
large mosses as never could be exhausted, great quantities of
very improveable ground, and has plenty of good lime in its
neighbourhood.  2 d, By rearing up chearful villages, and
giving advantageous feus to manufacturers.-A noble mind
will find unspeakable pleasure to observe many hundreds of
free industrious people thriving and happy, every one in his
own house; and to act such a part on the stage of life, as that
the two following lines of Virgil might, without much impro-
priety, be inscribed on his gravestone:

     Vixi, et quem dederat curfirm fortuna peregi;
     Urbem proclaram statui; mea inonia vidi.

Such a one would be happier in this than in having signed an
entail of a vast estate, though absolutely assured of legitimate
and undegenerate heirs.-This parish contains many spots
