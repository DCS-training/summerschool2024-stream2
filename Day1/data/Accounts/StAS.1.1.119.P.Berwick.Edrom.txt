L. 6493 Sterling per annum.  From a decreet of locality ob-
tained in 1733, it appears that the rent amounted then only
to L. 2000 Sterling yearly.  One of the heritors marled and
inclosed his whole estate, and the rent rofe from L. 500 to
L. 1500 a year.  Another marled the whole of his land,
inclosed it with stone dykes, and the rent rofe from L. 500
to L. 1200 or L. 1300 per annum.  Every estate, within
these 20 years, has risen in proportion.  Almost the whole
of the parish is inclosed.

   Church and Stipend.-The church was built in 1732, and

is patron.

are two rivers in the parish, viz. Whitewater and Blackwater,
commonly pronounced Whitadder and Blakadder.  White-
water rises in the Lammermuir Hills, near the confines of
Lothian, runs near 30 or 40 miles, and discharges itself into
the Tweed about 2 miles from Berwick.  It abounds with 
small trout.  A great number of salmon come up and spawn in
it.  Blackwater rises likewise in Lammermuir, above Green-
law, and after a course of about 16 or 18 miles, falls into the
Whitewater, at a village called Allantown, in this parish.  It
is celebrated for as fine trout as any in Scotland.

   Roads.-The roads are tolerably good.  They have been
