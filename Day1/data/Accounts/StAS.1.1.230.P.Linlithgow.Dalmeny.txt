master and beadle above 80; so that the four contemporaries
made up above 340 years.  Near this village, three persons
of one family died this year, whose ages, taken together, were
about 240 years.  From the parish register it appears, that,
in the course of these 36 years past, 35 persons have died 
between 50 and 60 years of age; 48 between 60 and 70; 58
between 70 and 80; 26 between 80 and 90; and 3 at 90
and upwards.  The purity of the air has, among other con-
siderations, occasioned a great number of gentlemens sons to
be sent as boarders to the parish school here.

   Soil, Acres, and Rent.-The soil of the higher grounds is,
in general, a shallow poor clay, for the most part on a cold
bottom, and which, in several places, borders on till.  That
of almost all Auldcathy is nearly the same.  The harvest, on
this account, is near two weeks later than in the neighbouring 
parishes of Cramond and Kirklifton.  At the same time, there
are some considerable tracts, particularly the declivities and
lower lying lands, which are a good loam; but, in several
places, intermixed with sand.  In this parish are also a few
spots of what is called perpetual soil, exceedingly fertile,
and which have had no dung, it is said, in the memory of
man.  Part of the minister's garden is of this kind, which
has been long known to produce great crops; and, of late,
surprising ones of potatoes have been reared.  For experi-
ment's sake, potatoes were lately planted on a portion of it,
six years running, and the last crop was as good as the first.
Dung was applied one year, but the plants ran to stalks and
leaves; the roots were numerous, but very small.  The num-
ber of acres in the whole parish is above 4500.  Hills, plan-
tations, avenues, etc. may occupy about 500 of these; about
2300 are in pasture, and 1700 in tillage.  Rent is from 6 s.
to 40 s. the acre:  The greater part less at from 20 s. to 30 s;
