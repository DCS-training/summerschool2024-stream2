Barony parish, are not considered as part of the suburbs, be-
ing about from 2 to 3 miles from the centre of the city.

   In looking over the bills of mortality the following years
appear to be unhealthy, as the number of deaths, in each of
them, very considerably exceeds the average, viz. 1723,
1740, 1741, 1748, 1751, and 1772.

   The total bill of mortality in 1792, was 2479.

   In addition to these accounts, the following tables, may
appear to be interesting, by furnishing materials for com-
parison with other places.
