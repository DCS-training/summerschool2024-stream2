is fully as much improved as the present state of things will admit
of, and our facilities of internal communication are as great as can
possibly be desired. The villages have increased in size and po-
pulation. Garlieston, from its ship-building and the improvement
of its harbour, has increased in commercial importance. The
knowledge, tastes, manners, and dress of the great body of the peo-
ple, have all been obviously much improved within the last forty
years; and the happiness and comfort of the labouring classes
might be still farther promoted by an enlightened co-operation of
landlord and tenant; to prevent the influx of Irish labourers, and
preserve the rate of wages from sinking too low. This would ad-
vance even the lowest classes in the parish to a point in the scale
of living, which, in seasons of dearth, Would admit of their making
some retrenchments in order to subsist on the profits of their own
industry; whereas, at present, in times of scarcity, they are either
reduced to want, or compelled to subsist on the voluntary contri-
butions of their more fortun`te neighbours,--a state of things,
which, in so far as it prevails, exerts the most debasing influence on
the genuine spirit of independence.
