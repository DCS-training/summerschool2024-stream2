ground.  The Tay, into which they issue, is the only ri-
ver in the parish.  It furnishes excellent salmon.  For-
merly the market here was well stocked with them, and
their price always moderate; but the whole fishings having
been let to companies of merchants in Perth, for a number
of years the produce has been sent in vessels to London,
where the demand for them has almost entirely removed
them from the reach of the people, for whose use nature
seems to have ordained them.  They are still caught in
great quantities in the river, but not many immediately
opposite to Errol.  The Tay, by the constant action of the
tide and current, making an impression on a soft bank, and
washing away every season a valuable portion of land, the
late proprietor of Errol built large stone dikes for the de-
fence of his estate.  Besides stretching along the coast, piers
were run some length into the river.  They have had a
considerable effect.  A strong crop of reeds grows annual-
ly in the mud, over which the tide regularly flows, which
help to diminish its influence, and, by their roots, to con-
solidate the earth; and the bank, which formerly was so
yielding, is become a firm beach, covered with young
planting, which is of use, both for ornament and protec-
tion.  But what is profitable by land is hurtful by water.
The long piers are supposed to have altered the position of
the banks on which the salmon were caught, and they
seem to have deserted that part of the coast.  There is a
popular tradition, that the Tay anciently ran along the
foot of the hills, by the N. of this parish; but if ever that
was the case, it must have been at a much earlier period
than is reported.  The change from that course to the
present, is supposed to have taken place in the 12th cen-
tury; but there are charters on record of that date, con-
firming to the Hays of Errol, and other proprietors in the
