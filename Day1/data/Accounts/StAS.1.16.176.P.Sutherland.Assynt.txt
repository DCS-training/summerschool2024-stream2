ing and Unapool. It has the additional shelter of Elan-
a-gha-un*, belonging to Un-a-pool-farm.  Poula-ghaun ia
in fight of the entry to Kilis-cu-ig formerly mentioned.
At a very short distance eastward from it is the harbour of
Cambus-vic-Hustan.  The common people call it Loch-
cam-mus-cu-sake.  It will contain safely from 12 to 18
herring-busses, and their boats.-Such is the coast, and such
are the harbours of Assint.
   It is unnecessary here to say any thing particular of the
great expansion of Kilis eastward of the last mentioned har-
bour, nor of the manner it terminates, having been already
set forth in p. 167, seq. of this Statistical Account.  All this
part of the coast, from the point of Row-store, along Slish-
a-chilish, to the march of Unapool with Glencull Edrachi-
list parish, is of equal, if not greater value than that track
formerly spoken of, from Inver-kirk-ag river to laid point
of Store, for there reasons, that it has more harbours, and
at least equal advantage in fishing.

     ISLANDS on the Coast, and belonging to the Parish of
     ASSINT.

   Elan-a-gharin.-This island belongs to the farm of Una-
pool, where their calves are speaned, and there occasionally
one cow may be fattened.

   Elan-an-du, or Black islands, and adjacent rocks, form
and shelter the harbour of Loch-Drumbaig.  There islands
are of little value, fit only for speaning a very few lambs
or kids.  The eagle pays them visits for a repast.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Elan-a-gha-un, also a compound, Elan signifying an Island: and
Gha-un, meaning a Six-month old of the cow-kind.  To this island the
tenants of Unapool send cattle of that age to be speaned.
