     Statistical Account

It is a considerable inconvenience to this parish, that there
is no bridge upon the Leven, nearer than Cameron, about
2 miles up the river.  But there are two good fords in the
neighbourhood, always passable, except if high floods,
or for an hour or two at high water, during spring tides;
and near the town, there  is also a coble or boat for passen-
gers.  It is likewise a very great incovenience ce, not only
to this parish, but to travellers in general, that there is
no bridge over Scoonie river, upon the great turnpike road
to the east coast.  The water is often regorged with such
banks of ice upon each side, that there is no passage for car-
riages, but with manifest danger.  Though in summer it is al-
most dry, yet the water sometimes rises to such a height, as
not to be fordable with safety.  Some years ago, a farmer and
his wife attempting to cross upon horseback, were carried a
considerable way down the stream; the woman not less than
400 or 500 yards.  Had they not been seen, and oppurtunely
assisted by thr neighbourhood, both of them must inevitably
have perished.
   It is to be hoped, for the credit of the gentlemen
of the district, that this inconveniency will soon be re-
medied.  The want of good free-stone quarries has been
a great discouragement to building in this parish, as stones
cannot be got, but with much labour and expence.  Never-
theless the greater part of this parish have reason to acknow-
ledge with gratitude, the goodness of a wife and gracious 
Providence, which hath rendered their situation, upon the
whole, so easy and comfortable.
