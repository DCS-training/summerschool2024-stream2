The whole is now in a state of cultivation, and more or less pro-
ductive. On the best land, eight bolls of barley per acre have
been produced, and, on an average, eight bolls of oats.
   Part of the lots were sold to labourers and trades-people, who,
employing all their spare time in bringing their small properties
into a condition fit for tillage, have at last greatly ameliorated their
condition. It may be mentioned, as a proof how well even soils
of an inferior quality will pay from this mode of treatment, that a
lot of twenty-four acres, which was originally purchased for L. 72,
was sold for L. 900 a few years ago. I have presumed to state
these facts, as an evidence that even the worst soils will in the end
well repay all the labour required to bring them into an arable
state, provided liberal encouragement, as in the present instance,
be granted to such purchasers as are above described, if sold in
similar lots.
   P. S.-Since writing the above, 271 acres of moor contiguous
to that sold in 1787 has been disposed of on the same conditions,
at from L. 21 to L. 5 per acre,-average price L. 11. It was dis-
posed of by public roup, and put up in lots of about two acres each.
Several proprietors of the old feus became purchasers, and some
of them bought several lots together, amounting to 12, 8, and 3 1/2
acres. Only two individuals bought lots a piece. The soil in
these new feus is by no means good; some of it is decidedly bad,
and none of it surpasses the greater part of that of the old feus; yet
I have no doubt but in the course of time it will prove a profitable
speculation to those who have bought it.
