acres. The garden, with the shrubbery, extends to about in acre
more. The stipend is 17 chalders, half meal, half barley, with
L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements.
  Religious Societies.-A Bible Society has existed for many
years. Since the dispute between the British and Foreign, and the
Edinburgh Bible Societies, its annual income has never been so
large. It fluctuates now from L.6 to L.8.
   Education.-The parochial teacher receives the maximum sa-
larly-L.34, 4s. 4 1/2d. The scholars are so numerous, as to render
an assistant necessary, who is paid by the teacher-the average
number being about 140. The whole emoluments, including the
fees of the session-clerkship, exceed L.100 per annum. This
is the fiftieth year of the present teacher, Mr Thomas Girdwood's
tenure of office, and no man ever filled it more worthily, or more
efficiently discharged its duties. There are other five schools,
attended in all by 250 scholars; but the provision for the sup-
port of the teachers, consisting, with one exception, entirely of
the school fees, is generally very inadequate.
   Of Sabbath schools, there are three,-one taught by the preach-
er at the preaching station; one by the teacher at Old Redding,
under the superintendence of the minister of the parish; and an-
other at Polmont by the parochial minister, assisted by the pa-
rochial teacher.
   Library.-A parish library was instituted in 1820. It contains
340 volumes. While the novelty lasted the books mere eagerly
read by the working-classes, for whose benefit it was intended;
but the interest, for some time, has much subsided; and propor-
tionally the subscribers have been reduced.
   Savings Bank.-One of these has existed since 1818. It is
chiefly parochial. The deposits are lodged principally by farm-ser-
vants. The following is a state of the funds for the last four years,

   There was a benefit society; but, as it was established on faulty
principles, the box was broken, and the society dissolved a few
years ago, in consequence of the payments being inadequate to
meet the expenditure, and the rapid diminution of the funds.
There are still two societies for defraying funeral expenses.
