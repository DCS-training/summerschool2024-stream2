the family of Douglas by the death of Archibald Earl of
Forfar, who died at Stirling of his wounds received at
Sherrifmuir, in the year 1715."
   The above account is confirmed by this circumstance,
that the different parts of the edifice retained each the
name of the builder; such as Valence tower, Douglas tower*,
Hamilton tower, and the Cuming, tower; and some are still
known by them.  The Douglas family had exceedingly
enlarged and improved it; their arms were found in dif-
ferent places of the wall.  It is impossible to form a just
idea of its former greatness, as it is said that a great deal of
it was taken down by the Earl of Forfar, out of which he
built a modern house.
   There is this peculiar to that superb structure, that all
the neighbouring objects are in a great style.  The Clyde
makes a fine circle round the Castle; the breadth of the
river is considerable; the streams spread over a plain roc-
ky bottom; the banks, on both sides, are very high, and
adorned with natural wood.  The Craig of Blantyre, with
the ruins of the old house of the Priors upon the top of it,
immediately opposite, has a striking effect; while this no-
ble monument of ancient grandeur extends along the sum-
mit of the north bank, with a bold aspect to the south, at
both ends rears its lofty towers, and dignifies the whole
scene+.
