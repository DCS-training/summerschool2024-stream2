phenomenon happened at Tuary, though not so very fatal,
but the marks of which still remain discernible.  Inundations
of the river of Helmsdale, with floods in summer and har-
vest, often become fatal and destructive in the strath of Kil-
donan; and the tenantry, whose lands lie flat and low along
the water, have their corn and hay carried down by the stream-
They are obliged to carry home these articles with all conve-
nient speed, and season them nigh their dwelling places.
Their lands are commonly in good heart, by the frequent
overflowings of the river, and produce good rich crops of bear,
eats, and potatoes.  By means of these inundations, the ri-
ver has changed its original course, and detached several
fields on each side, from the farms to which they formerly
belonged.

   Language.-The language spoken in this parish is Gaelic,
and the greatest number of the names of places is of Gaelic
extraction.  For example, Knocfin, Fungal's Hill, from Knoc,
a hill, and Fin, the contraction of Fungal; Grimachcorigh, the 
valley of Rein Ghrun; Costaligh, a lower's bollow, the name
of the remains of a Pictith tower in the bottom of the town.
The places beginning with Cd, seem to be a mixed compo-
sition of Gaelin and Latin, as Kildonan, Kildonan, etc.

   Disadvantages.-There is as yet no proper house of accom-
modation for strangers in the parish.  There are, indeed, 8
whisky houses, in which much tippling is carried on, and of
consequence, several immoral practices have been thereby in-
troduced among the people.  But cannot be accommodated,
unless they lodge in the minister's house.  This renders the
road from the coast of Sutherland to the north coast, very
inconvenient to strangers of that description.  This parish
