river trout, herlings, cod, flounder, plaice, dab eels, lytbe, sole,
mullet, skate, lamprey, whiting, par, spirling. Pike and perch
have been occasionally caught in the fresh water portion of the
river, and in the lower part are sometimes taken small herrings,
haddocks, ling, mackerel, turbot, and shrimps, &c. Lesser spot-
ted sharks (called here dog-fish), angel-sharks and porpoises have
at intervals appeared, and been killed. Salmon and grilse pro-
ceed up the Dee for the purpose of spawning, at all seasons of the
year, but perhaps the principal run is during the month of July.
They leave the fresh water again in the greatest numbers from the
middle of February to the middle or end of March. The river
exhibits the largest quantity of salmon-fry about the 12th of May.
The shell-fish of the parish are, lobsters, crabs, rock-oysters,
cockles, muscles, wilks, buckies, limpets, pipes. Mussels are much
sought after by the poor, and may be collected on some rocks in
pretty large quantities. On the Torrs' shore are seen, during spring
tides, considerable numbers of oysters. Buckies are here exten-
sively used as baits for white fish; they are therefore of much va-
lue. Limpets and a kind of sand-worms are likewise used.
	There are few reptiles in the parish, and insects are not parti-
cularly destructive.
	The following animals formerly existed, but have now disap-
peared, viz. the urus,--an animal resembling a bull,--the wolf, the
deer, the wild cat, and the eagle.
