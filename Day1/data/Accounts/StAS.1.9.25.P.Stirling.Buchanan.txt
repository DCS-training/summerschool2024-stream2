built near mid-way between Lochlomond and Lochcatrine;
the design of which was to guard the pass between the two
lochs, and prevent the cattle and goods of the people in
the lower parts of the country being stolen and carried
away northward, as also to be a check upon the country
around it; the people thereabout being as ready as any o-
thers to take away their neighbour's goods.  This fort was
burnt in 1745, but was afterward repaired.  There used
to be a company of men stationed there some time ago;
but, for several years past, it has been supplied with a few
men from the castle of Dunbarton.
   The people on the south side of the Grampian Hills,
speak nothing but English; on the north side, such as have
been born and brought up there, speak the English and
Gaelic.  Of late years, several tenants from the south side,
have removed to farms on the north side; these speak
English only.  All the names of places within the parish
are Gaelic: as, Coldrach, 'The Back of the Oaks; 'Blar-
vokie, or 'Plain of the He-Goat;' Stronmacnair, 'The
'Point of the Hill, belonging to the Son of the Heir;'
Benlomond' The bare green Hill.'
