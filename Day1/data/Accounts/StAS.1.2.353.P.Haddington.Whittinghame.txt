within the parish, every ploughgate being assessed in 20 s. ster-
ling.  Tbis is, no doubt, a heavy tax upon the farmers, but 
it is generally paid with the greatest chearfulness, from a tho-
rough conviction of the great conveniency and advantage of
good roads.  Before this improvement in the police of the
country, the farmers were obliged to transport their corn, to
Hadington, on horseback; especially during the winter season.
Now they generally send, on a double cart, 8 or 10 times the

branch of police; for which, they are justly entitled to the
highest approbation.

they hire occasionally women and the young of both sexes,
for hoeing, weeding, etc.  The taskers are those, who are
employed in threshing out the corn; and they receive one
boll of every 25, or the twenty-fifth part for their labour; and
this has been their fixed and stated wages, as far back as

masters as day-labourers, at a stipulated hire.  A threshing ma-

houses.  They are easy and free from care, having nothing to at-

for these many years past.  This is owing to its quality,
which is of such a nature, that it rises in value with every o-
ther article.  It consists in grass for a cow in summer, and
