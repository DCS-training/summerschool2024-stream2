history, antiquities, and biography of the county.  In this way, owing to the
exertions of the Clergy, animated and solicited to the pursuit by a Scottish
Baronet, a curious and judicious Account is now giving, not of a single
county, but of a whole sister Kingdom.

   No XIX.  Extract of a Letter from the Reverend Dr Blinshall, Mini-
   ster of Dundee, dated 17th January 1793.

   I AM very happy, but not surprised, at the universal approbation which
your Statistical Plan meets with, and I hope that the best success will at-
tend your labours.  My delaying so long to make any return to the vari-
ous and much esteemed letters I received from you, was in consequence of
my Colleague having readily agreed to draw up the answers to your
queries.

   No XX.  Extract of a Letter from his Excellency John Adams, now
   President of the United States of America, dated Philadelphia, 2d
   March 1793.

   I RECEIVED yours, with your plans for a natural history of sheep, and the
Statistical Survey of Scotland.  You could not have made a wiser choice.
The natural history of that animal, so useful to man, must be extremely
important, as well as extremely curious; and a detail of particulars, rela-
tive to your native country, must be interesting to all but especially to the
inhabitants of it.  We, in this country, enjoy a delicious tranquility at pre-
sent, and if your European fermentations should not disturb us, shall conti-
nue to be happy.

   No XXI.  Extract Translation of a Letter from the Comte de Herts-
   berg, dated Berlin, 8th March 1793.

   I HAVE to return you my best thanks for your interesting Work, the Sta-
tistical Account of the Parishes in Scotland.  I find the plan particularly
well formed, and if I were again at the head of the Prussian Cabinet, would
carry it into execution here.
