habitants of the south of Scotland, yet there is nothing more
certain than that they are to be found hatching in the rocks
about Lismore.  They are nerly of the same size with the
grey-headed ones.  The cuckow, swallow, water-wagtail,
wood-cock, corn-crake or rail, with the lapwing, or green
plover, make their appearance at the stated seasons.  In se-
vere winters, a few swans visit the lakes of this parish; but
they seldom remain long in this country.

   Number of Horses, Sheep, etc.-It is difficult to ascertain
the number of cattle in these parishes.  Very few horses are
now bred here; and all the black cattle bred are principally
intended for common family use.  There are 25000 sheep in
the parish, or perhaps many more, as they are daily on
the increase.  The value of wool here has been always fluc-
tuating, from 3 s. 9 d. to 6 s. and 7 s. the stone, the white,
and that laid with tar mixed.  At an average, from 7 to 8
fleeces go to a stone.

   Population.-There is no ascertaining whether population
is on the increase or decline here, though, at first view, the
immense tracts of sheep-farms might naturally induce us to
think it decreasing.  The inhabitants amount at present to 
3526 fouls.  Lismore contains 1121 of that number.

   A rage for emigration has got to a great height, of late, in
the Highlands.  There have been two emigrations from these
parishes, particularly from Appin.  The inhabitants are now
become to crowded, that some relief of this fort, in one shape
or other, seems absolutely necessary.  In 1775, the first ship,
completely loaded with emigrants, mostly from these parish-
es, failed for North Carolina.  The American war, which
broke out next year, put a stop to all attempts of this nature
