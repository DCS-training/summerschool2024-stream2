     Statistical Account

   The black cattle are not smaller than in any other district
of the county; and they are often of a finer pile and form,
to which the herbage of the rich soils and the warm sheltered
situation are presumed to contribute.
   Their number and their value are so often varied, by the
rise or fall of the demand or of the price, that these particu-
lars cannot with any responsible precision be stated.
   Although there are but few farms on which there are no
sheep kept, yet this kind of stock is of no distinguished con-
sideration, has received but slight attention, and been regard-

commerce or agricultural profit.  To render this stock of
proper account, it is requisite to take measures in summer,
for securing a certain and more plentiful supply of food,
during the snows of winter, and the cold weather, and the
scanty pasturage of the spring months.
   There has never been any measurement or survey of the
parish.  The number of arable acres may be supposed about
a fifth part of the whole; the outfield may be about a third
part more in quantity than the infield: Originally they must
have been nearly of the same quantity, and of equal value;
but at present, there is certainly a great difference.  The
outfield may be accounted worth 5 s the acres and the infield
may be valued about a guinea; but as the number of acres
is no where ascertained, and as the rents are paid in meal
and money, in customs and services to the heritor, and to
the miller, neither landlord nor tenant can say with any pre-
cision, what the rent may be by the acre.
   On most farms it would be proper to remove the buildings
to the vicinity of the outfields, and to cultivate them in a
suitable rotation of crops, with the application of the whole
manure, and a proper allowance for lime; while the infields,
if enclosed and laid out in artificial grass, would for some
