     Statistical Account

occupy a place in the scale of national character nearer the
phlegm of Dutchmen, than the other inhabitants of Scotland
in general.  The writer of the present article was forcibly
struck with this observation, when he first settled in the pa-
rish; and its truth has been confirmed by a few years expe-
rience.  He has frequently attempted to account for it.  Al-
though political institutions have a greater influence on
general character than almost any other cause, yet the ap-
pearance of a country operates with an uniform and unceas-
ing, and therefore with a very powerful effect on the minds
of its inhabitants.  And it is to this cause that the peculiari-
ty of character above-mentioned may, perhaps, in a great
measure, be ascribed.  A constant uniformity in the appear-
ances of nature around us, gives no scope for that violent a-
gitation, which so frequently takes place in the breasts of
Swiss and Scotchmen, when they contemplate their moun-
tains, their woods, and their precipices.  Our mental con-
stitution, therefore) naturally settles into a species of unifor-
mity, analogous to the country which we inhabit; and the
less elevated and romantic emotions, raised by interest and
mutual intercourse, take the lead in forming the character.
Such seems to be the case with the inhabitants of this corn-
er of Scotland.  The consequences are, sewer characters
very strongly marked, and more difficulty in changing men-
tal habits.  In this respect, there exists a strong similarity be-
tween the character of the boors in Holland, and that of the
peasants in this part of Scotland.  The latter, however, pos-
sess a greater share of general knowledge; the former a far
more intimate and accurate acquaintance with their own par-
ticular department.  It is between these two classes that a
comparison, with regard to provincial and national charac-
ter, can be instituted with the greatest propriety.  Because
