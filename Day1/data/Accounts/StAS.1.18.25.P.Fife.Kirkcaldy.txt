     of Kirkaldy.

1760, it employed no more than one coaster of 50 tons, and
two ferry-boats, each of 30*.
   On the return of peace in 1763, the shipping immediately
revived.  By the year 1772, it had increased to 11 vessels,
carrying 515; tons and 49 men; and although its progress was
retarded by the war with America, it amounted, at the close
of that war, to 12 vessels, carrying 750 tons and 59 men.
-From that time, it has made constant and rapid ad-
vances.

   Present State of the shipping.-At present+, it consists
of 26 square rigged vessels++, 1 sloop, and 2 ferry-boats, car-
rying by the register 3700 tons, about 5000 tons dead weight,
employing 225 men to navigate them; and worth, when clear
to fail, about L. 30,000.  One or two of the smallest vessels are
employed as coasters, and trade either to Aberdeen or Lon-
don; carrying to the former, salt and coals; to the latter, the
manufactures of the district; and returning from both with
goods, chiefly for this port and Leith.  All the other ships
are employed either in the foreign trade for home consump-
tion, or in the carrying trade.  Some of the largest of them
are employed in the trade to the Mediterranean, the West
Indies, and America; and of these some have been occasion-
ally absent from this place for 3 or 4 years.  But the greater
number is employed in the trade to Holland and the Baltic.
To these the only article of export is coals, shipped here, at
Dysart, Wemyss, and other ports on the Frith; and the chief
articles imported from them are corn, flax, flax-seeds linen-
