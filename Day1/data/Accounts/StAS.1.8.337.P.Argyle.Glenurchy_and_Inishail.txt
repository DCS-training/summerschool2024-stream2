     of Glenorchay and Inishail.

   Surface and Soil.-Excepting the vale of Glenorchay,
which forms a beautiful plato of more than 3 miles in length,
and half a mile in breadth, the plains of Auch, of Auchal-
lader, and part of the lands of Hayfield, the country exclu-
sively is mountainous and hilly.  The river Urchay winds
in a gentle current through the vale, dividing it into two
equal parts.  On each side of the river, the soil is a mixture
of light earth and sand; and on the sides of Lochow, as far
as the parish extends, it is generally a deeper earth and richer
loam, on beds of till or gravel.  The glebe, on which the
church and manse are built, is a beautiful oblong isle, formed
by the river Urchay.  It is in the centre of the valley and
above a mile in circumference, and every where bordered
with natural terraces and shelving banks, and fringed with
coppice and various kinds of trees, to the very edge of the
river.

   Produce and Cultivation.-The crops produced, on these
lands, are the blainsley, the early white, and the small grey
oats; Scotch bear, potatoes, a few field turnips, some artificial,
and much natural, as well as meadow grasses.  The ordinary
return from oats is from 3 to 4 seeds; of barley, from 5 to 7,
and from the boll of potatoes, from 12 to 20.  The annual
change of the different seeds is found to be of great advan-
tage, as the same seed, sown successively for years, in the same
soil, becomes gradually small and unproductive.  It is cus-
tomary, yearly, to import quantities of seed oats from the high
grounds near the Kirk of Shotts, and from several parts of
Perthshire.  Culinary plants are coming more and more in-
to general use in this country:  Some years ago it required the
influence of the landlord; and in some places, an express sti-
pulation in the lease, before the common people could be got
to plant greens, or fence garden.
