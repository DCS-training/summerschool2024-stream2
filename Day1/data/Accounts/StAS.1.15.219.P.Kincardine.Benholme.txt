parish.

   Fish, Kelp, etc.-The coast abounds with fish of various
kinds.  Cod, ling, skate, halibut, and some turbet are caught
from March to the end of July: Haddocks, small cod, whit-
ings, and a few flounders, are taken all the year round, but
in greatest plenty from October to the middle of February.
Crabs and lobsters, limpets and periwinkels, are likewise
in abundance.  Numbers of porpoises, seals, and sometimes
whales, are seen close upon the coast.  The rocks produce
dulce and tangles, with various sea-weeds, which are con-

however, as the people employed in making it are able to
pay a yearly rent of 12 L. to the proprietors, for liberty to
crop the growth of their rocks.

   Climate.-The climate varies considerably in different
parts of this parish, according to the exposure and height of
the ground.  It is often mild and temperate upon the shore,
when it is cold and piercing in the more inland parts.  Dur-
ing the spring and summer months, thick mists frequently arise
from the sea; so that the air along the coast is damp, though
not unhealthy, being purified by the North and West winds.
These winds are both so frequent and strong here, that
young trees are generally observed to incline towards the S. E.

   Soil.-The soil upon the shore is light and gravelly: in
some places, nothing but naked stones appear; but where
these have been covered with earth brought down from the
higher grounds; either by human industry or the winter
rains, good crops are produced, when the season is not re-
markably dry.  Farther up, the soil is deeper and more fer-
