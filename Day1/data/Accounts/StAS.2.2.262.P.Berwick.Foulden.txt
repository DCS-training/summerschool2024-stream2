of Jerviswoode, and to Miss Wood of Nunlands. Nunlands is the
least estate, but far above L. 50 in yearly value.
   Historical Notices.-On the 24th March 1587, a conference
was held in Foulden church between commissioners sent by
Elizabeth of England to Scotland, and others appointed by our
James VI. At this meeting were discussed the circumstances
which, according to Elizabeth, vindicated her treatment of Mary,
and, in particular, her execution.
   Antiquities.-The only antiquity in Foulden which merits no-
tice is an epitaph in the church-yard, dated 4th January 1592.
The person whom it commemorates must have been of some dis-
tinction; for traditionary accounts of his forays are still extant.
The epitaph is highly interesting as an excellent example of the
quaintness of thought and style, so universal at the time at which
it was written.

   Parochial Registers.-The parochial registers have suffered mu-
tilation, and had been long kept in a very slovenly manner. The
earliest entry is dated 13th April 1682.
