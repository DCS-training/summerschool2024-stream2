der such a system, agriculture cannot be expected to make
great progress.

   Horses, Cows, and Sheep.-The horses, with which this
and the neighbouring parishes are stocked, are of the High-
land breed, and of about 12 or 13 hands high.  They are
very hardy, and easily supported.  Their number, in this
parish, is 926.  The cattle are also of the Highland kind;
are kept principally for breeding, and amount to 3028-
The number of sheep in the parish amounts to about 11,480.
They are of the black-faced breed, which, for about half
century past, have gradually succeeded the antient High-
land, or native kind, a few of which yet remain in some
places in the neighbourhood.  The above numbers of the
live stock are exclusive of followers.  Some trials have
lately been made to introduce the Cheviot breed of sheep.
Lord Breadalbane, a few years ago, complimented some of
his principal tenants with a few of the Cheviot sheep, by
way of trial.  But none of the sheep graziers have discover-
ed any inclination to stock their farms with them, in prefe-
rence to the black-faced kind.

   Rental.-The real rent of the parish may be about 2800 l.

last 12 years, in consequence of the rise in the price of sheep
and black cattle.  The produce of the parish is supposed to
be rather more than what is sufficient for the consumpt of
the inhabitants.

   Antiquities.-On a small island, at the west end of Loch
Tay, are the ruins of a priory dependent on the religious
establishment of Scone.  It was founded in the year 1122,
by Alexander I. of Scotland, in which were deposited the
