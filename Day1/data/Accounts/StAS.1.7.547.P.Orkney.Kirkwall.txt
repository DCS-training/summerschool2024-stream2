swans, gannets, crows, pigeons, curlieus, the green and com-
mon plover, moorfowl, and snipe, the starling, and fieldfare,
the sand and sky-lark, the swallow, the snowflake, the rail or
corncrake, the wren, the check, the linnet, and the sparrow.
How many of these are natives of this place cannot with
much certainty be determined.  But we do not recollect to
have seen on the shores of either England or Scotland the
ember goose, which is a bird of a large size, and an elegant
form, which is never seen on land, and which is supposed to
hatch her eggs under her wing, where there is a hole which
nature it is thought has prepared for the purpose.  Neither
do we remember to have seen in the south the dunter or ei-

parture from Orkney in the spring for the north to obey the
dictates of nature, the pickternies, which come here about
the beginning of the month of May from the east or north-

low, and the rail or corncrake, which come here some time
in the spring from the south, are the principal.  After a
hard gale of wind, especially from the east, south-east, or
south, birds are often to be seen which are by no means in-
habitants of this region.  These seem to be overtaken by the
storm, and driven hither by force of weather, and as they
frequently disappear in a short time, they either perhaps re-
