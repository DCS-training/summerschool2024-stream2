subdivisions of the inclosures, and of a house for the cattle that
are to be fed upon the turnips, distinct from the common byre,
seem to be the chief obstacles to their culture.-Perhaps the
small extent of the carfe farms is also an obstacle to the pro-
duction of any considerable quantity of wheat or hay, as also
to the summer fallowing to any great extent-The size of the 
farms is so much adapted to the present custom of executing
all the labour in the spring, that the division of the labour into
different seasons, which is one great benefit of the introduc-
tion of wheat and hay, would not enable the farmer to lessen
the number of his servants and horses.-Notwithstanding of
this, however, summer fallowing bids fair to become a general
practice in the carse, as it is highly beneficial to a clay soil, and
allows the lime to be applied to the best advantage.-Great
quantities of lime for manure are brought from Sauchie, five
miles distant from the E. point of the parish, and also from
the Earl of Elgin's works on the Forth.
   The price of a heaped bushel, wheat measure, of shells, or
unslacked lime is 4 d. and of the carriage to Kincardine from
2 d 1/2, to 4 d.- In the dryfield I 10 bushels are allowed, at an ave-
rage, 240 bushels, are allowed.-The use of lime as a manure
is of an old date here, but it was never carried to any valuable
height, until in consequence of the building of a bridge over
the Forth at Dript, about 20 years ago, carts could be used
conveniently for its carriage; before this event it was carried
chiefly on horses backs.-The demand is increasing annually,
and for several  years past, has much exceeded the supply.
   There is no ground almost kept in the carfe for pasturage,
excepting what is liable to be overflowed by the rivers-This
is pastured by the milk cows, but a considerable part of their
food even in summer is broad clover, given then in the byre.
The horses are fed almost entirely on it in summer, being ne-
