cept upon two estates, where the servants drive all the coals, 
and the cottagers are bound to assist in cutting down the 
crops of the landlord.  In the southern parts of the parish, 
on the high grounds, the feed time and harvest, are, at an a-
verage, about two weeks later than about Edinburgh; but 
in the lower parts, to the north, they are nearly the same. 
The harvest of the years 1782 and 1784, were here re-
markably bad.  The former, was so every where in Scotland;
but the latter, was equally so here, from a long tract of 
wet weather, which prevented the grain from ripening.
The prices of provisions here, are much same, as in the 
Edinburgh market; as, from the easy conveyance to that 
quarter, all the produce of the fields, can easily be sent there, 
if the same price, or something near it, cannot ne obtained 
on the spot.
