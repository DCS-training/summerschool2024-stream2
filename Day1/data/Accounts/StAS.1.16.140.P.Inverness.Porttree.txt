of stupendous height, and magnificently grand, rise one
above another*.  At the bottom of these rocks above the
shore, for more than 1-4th of a mile in length, is a decli-
vity which, though steep, of difficult access, and every
where interspersed with large loose stones that fall from
the cliffs above, yields such excellent pasture, that the gen-
tleman who possesses the farm to which it belongs, at the
risk of losing some of them over the precipices, sends there
every summer a part even of his milk cows.  Here as well
as over all Sky, from the height of the hills and proximity
of the sea, the air seldom continues long of the same tem-
perature; sometimes it is dry, oftener moist, and in the
latter end of winter and beginning of spring, cold and pier-
cing; at an average, three days in twelve throughout the
year, scarcely free from rain, far less from clouds.  These,
attracted by the hills, sometimes break in useful and refresh-
ing showers; at other times suddenly bursting, pour down
their contents with tremendous noise, in impetuous torrents
that deluge the plains below, and render the smallest rivu-
let impassable; which, together with the stormy winds so
common in this country, in the months of August and
September, frequently blast the hopes, and disappoint the
expectations of the husbandman.  Snow has been often
known to lie on the ground from three to seven weeks;
and on the highest hills, even in the middle of June, some
spots of it are to be seen.  To this various temperature of
the air, and uncertainty of weather, the fevers and agues,
headachs, rheumatisms, colds, and dysenteries, which are
the prevalent distempers, may be ascribed.  That it is far,

which inhabits the farm, who are said to have occupied it since the time
of the Danes.
