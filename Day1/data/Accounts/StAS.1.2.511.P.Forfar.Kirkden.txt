   Division and Rent of Lands.-The whole extent of the pa-
rish is nearly 3500 acres; about 3000 of which are arable, and
the remainder planted, or more, not yet improved.  It is di-
vided among 6 proprietors, 4 of whom reside in it.  Only a-
bout a half of the parish is yet inclosed; but the inclosing pro-
ceeds apace; the better sort of farmers being very sensible of 
the great advantage which may be derived from it.
/pThere are about a dozen of persons, including 3 proprie-
tors, who farm from about 30 to 150 acres each.  The
rest of the parish is divided into smaller portions, from 36
down to 6 acres; for there are very few families in the parish,
who have not one, one or more cows, not excepting those who
live partly on charity.-The rent of most farms, lately 
let in lease, taking the good and bad land of the farm, at an a-
verage, is 15 s.  One large inclosed farms, however, lately let
at L. 1 the acre.-The late leases are, in general, for 19
years.  For a crop of lint land, some pay L. 5, and some (this
year) L. 6: 3, the acre.  Those who let the land, plough and
harrow it, and carry the flax to and from the watering.-
Personal services, those badges of antient slavery, are still part-
ly continued, though lighter than formerly, and now limited.
Several of the tenants, however, are altogether freed from
them. It is a pretty common thing, to pay certain number
of kain fowls.  Some of the tenants are obliged to give a
draught of one, or more horses, for a specified number of 
miles, if required; or to send one or more carts for coals to
the proprietor, and to give, perhaps, a day of all their reapers,
