ed by the collections at the church doors.  The collections,
at a medium, including mort-cloth fees, and dues for mar-
riages, amount to about 56 L. per annum.  The poor's money
is distributed to them monthly, and they are allowed from
2 s. to 5 s. at a time.  There is an Antiburgher and a Relief
meeting-house in Coupar.  The latter was built in 1792.  They
are both well filled, but chiefly from the neighbouring pa-
rishes.

   School.-The school was rebuilt in 1792, and is large and
well lighted.  The average number of scholars is about 60.
The master is in a valetudinary state, and the school is taught
by an assistant.  English is taught for 1 s. 6 d. writing and
arithmetic at 2 s. 6 d. and Latin at 3 s. per quarter.  The
salary is 11 L. 2 s. 1 4/12 d. Sterling.  Sir John Sinclair, or any
other public spirited gentlemen connected with Parliament,
who have the interest of their country at heart, must be con-
vinced of the necessity of adopting some plan, to put the pa-
rochial teachers in Scotland on a more respectable footing.
Their situation, at present, is not equal, in point of emo-
lument, on an average, to that of the meanest mechanic or
day labourer.

   Disadvantages.-The scarcity of fuel, and the great distance
from any sea-port, are inconveniencies severely felt by the in-
habitants of this district.  The mosses, the nearest of which
is 6 miles distant, are either totally exhausted, or restricted
to the tenants of the ground.  To have coals from Perth or
Dundee is found, therefore, to be the cheapest expedient.
These, considering the distance they have to be driven, and
the high expences of carriage, prove very expensive to the
poor tradesman.  Much, too, of the farmer's time, that would
have been laid out in improving his farm, is indispensibly lost
