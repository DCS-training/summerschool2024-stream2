         No indigenous trees are to be seen, if we except a few dwarf bushes
      of birch, willow, and mountain-ash.  In one or two gardens, syca-
      mores and other trees, planted probably a hundred years ago, have
      attained the height of 40 or 50 feet,-the girth, within three feet
      of the ground, being above six feet.  That trees have formerly
      grown in abundance iin Shetland can hardly, I think, be doubted,
      from the absence of any appreciable peculiarity in climate or soil
      fatal to their growth, and from the general diffusion of their re-
      mains in the peat moors.  Some of those peat trees were of no
      inconsiderable dimensions; but, for the most part, they are of
      small size.  From this, however, it cannot be fairly inferred that,
      generally, the native trees were diminutive.  Timber must always
      have been valuable in this country, and the inbabitants,would na-
      turally consume all that was of any respectable size,-especially as
      no spot of ground is six miles from the sea in every direction, and
      therefore the woods would be easily accessible.  But it is the opi-
      nion of some, that trees in size and quantity cannot now be reared
      in Shetland.  The experiment, however, has never been fairly
      made.  Let an intelligent and experienced forester, residing long
      enough in these islands to modify his experience to suit their cli-
      mate, superintend for a sufficiently long period, and on a scale of
      adequate magnitude, the culture of various kinds of hardy trees,
      and then, and not before, can the capabilities of Shetland, with
      regard to arboriculture, be ascertained.  It is to be hoped that
      some spirited and far-sighted proprietor will ere long put the mat-
