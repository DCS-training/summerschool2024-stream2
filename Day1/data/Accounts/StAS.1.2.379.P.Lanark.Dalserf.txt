to which markets a great deal of smaller fruit, such as goose-
berries and currants are also sent.
   The natural coppice woods consist chiefly of oaks, ash, elm,
birch and older, and are cut down once in 30 years.  The
tress that are suffered to stand, near the river Clyde, particu-
larly planes, oak, and ash, grow to a great size.  On the up-

of late years, been considerably increased, owing chiefly to the
