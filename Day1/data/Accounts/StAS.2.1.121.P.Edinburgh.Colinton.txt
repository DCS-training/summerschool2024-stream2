five considerable villages, as many hamlets, and various small knots
of houses connected with farms and mills.  The villages are,

   Dr. Walker says in the old Account, that in this parish, the re-
gisters of baptisms and marriages have been regularly kept since 1655;
and that burials since 1728.  This continues to be the case. On-
ly it must be observed, that many of the Seceders do not register
the baptism of their children; and that individuals who die in the
parish are sometimes buries elsewhere, and consequently are not re-
gistered here.  This last source of error in any calculations, founded
on the registers of burials, is understood to be compensated by the
burials which place here from other parishes.
   The birth from 1827 to 1836 inclusive, were 241 males, 227
females, in all 468; of these 27 were still-born, or died before
being baptised;10 were twins,and 12 were illegitimate.  The
burials in the same years amounted to 429;of these 182 were
under twelve years of age; and 71 were seventy years old and up-
wards.  the marriages during the same period amounted to 127.
   The numberof families in the parish is 440; the average num-
ber of individuals to each family is 4 1/2.  There are in the parish
445 houses, and there are 52 dwelling places empty.
   There is, at present, only one pauper lunatic connected with
the parish and two residing in it.  There are 2 blind persons, 2
fatuous,and 1 deaf and dumb.
   There are no customs peculiar to the parish.  The people are
on the whole attentive to cleanliness, dress well on the Sabbath,
and,if they would act aright, have the  comforts and advantages of
society in reasonable degree.  They are not generally given to
reading.  Some years ago an attempt was made to cherish the prac-
tice, by introducing among them itinerating libraries,--the first
year's expense having been kindly defrayed by a friend.  But the
experiment came to a close  at the end of the fourth year, when
the money drawn from the readers was not equal to the hire of
the books.  One vice prevails greatly among the people, which
eats out a mans heart, and renders him indifferent to religion, to
knowledge, and to his nearest and dearest friends viz. the drinking
of ardent spirits. It was ascertained that the drinking portion of the
working classes in the parish must have spent L.2300 for spirits in
