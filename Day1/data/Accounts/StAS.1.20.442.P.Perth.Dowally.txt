"partly of stone," so early as 1469.  But there is no evi-
dence of it having been ever completed, and no vestige of it
now remains.  The foundation of a second bridge was laid
in 1513, by Bishop Brown, "near to his own palace, " and
it was continued and completed by Bishop Gavin Dou-
glas*.  A part of the arch which sprang from the north
bank is still entire, and when the river is low, the piles, on
which the pillars of the second and the third arches were
supported, are visible.  No account has been transmitted,
of the time at which it was demolished or swept away; but
its loss is daily felt, and loudly complained of.  To the ca-
sual traveller, and bridge would be obviously a desirable
accommodation. and to Dunkeld, and the large district con-
nected with it, a most important acquisition.  The river
(which has been known to rise 17 feet at the ferry above
its usual level) is often so swelled, as to render the passage
by a boat either impracticable, or highly perilous; and the
general waste of time, and danger to carriages which is ex-
perienced, (however skilfully or alertly the boats are ma-
naged), oftern prompts those who would have otherwise pre-
ferred Dunkeld as a market-place, to proceed to Perth.  An
ultimate, by an engineer of talents and experience, calcu-
lates the cost of a bridge, of three arches, to be built oppo-
site to the church of Little-Dunkeld, at L. 12,000 Sterling.
