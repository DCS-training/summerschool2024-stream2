by the presbytery on the 19th November 1655, after some inter-
ruption by the governor of the castle, on the ground of the ques-
tion raised by Mr Guthrie, as to his right to nominate the second
minister, being still pending before the Council of State. The result
of the disagreement was, an order of the Court of Session to build
up a wall of partition, to divide the fabric of the church into two distinct
churches; which was done, and two congregations formed, in 1656.
  Matthias, Simpson succeeded James Guthrie in the first charge
in 1661, and died in 1664.  The cause of the opposition made by
Guthrie to Simpson, becomes evident from the opposite courses
they followed at the Restoration of Charles.  Guthrie had been a
Protester, and died a martyr to his principles; Simpson, a Re-
solutioner, conforms to prelacy and is promoted.
