     Statistical Account

near the burn of Garwall, there is a very large spring, burst-
ing out of the solid rock, in the form of a spout, the waters
whereof are supposed mineral, though no trial has been made
of their quality.

   The town of Doune is plentifully supplied with springs
of soft water, that never dry in the warmest summer; and
the banks of Teith abound with similar natural springs.  In
short, the whole grounds are liberally supplied with water,
for the use of man and beast.

   Below the hill Uaighmor, there is a considerable lake,
formed chiefly from the multitude of living springs men-
tioned above, called Lochmaghaig, which is a Gaelic word,
and means the loch at the level field-aig, being the Gaelic
word for at, and magh, for a level field; so the loch just
mentioned lies at the level below Uaighmor.  This lake
forms nearly a circle, and is about a mile diameter.  The
adjoining heritors are, the Earl of Moray, whose grounds
nearly surround it, and Edmonstone of Cambuswallace.  It
is of considerable depth, but no exact sounding has been
made.

   There is a small lake near Gartincaber, not near so large
as Lochmaghaig.  Except these, there are no other lakes
within the parish.

   The river Forth boudns the south end of the parish, and
has been already described.  It is navigable as far as the
cruives of Craigforth, and could be easily rendered so all
the way to Gartmore, by deepening one or two fords.

   The Forth abounds with salmon; an account of the fish-
ing whereof is given in the Statistical Account of the pa-
rish of Stirling.  The tract of the river above Craigforth is
so narrow and deep, that the net cannot be used with suc-
cess.

   The next river is the Teith, formerly mentioned.  It a-
rises from Loch Cathrine, in Balquihidder; from whence it
