   Agriculture.-The rent of the best land is from 5 s. to
15 s. the acre, but that of some of the worst has been re-
cently 16 s. 8 d.  Of the best land, the leases are sold,
having been let about 23 years ago, most of them for
twice 19 years, and a lifetime, the rent rising 1 s. the acre
at the 20th year.  At that period, little or nothing had
been done in the way of improving land, and the tenants
were in general poor; most of them are now in easy,
some of them in opulent circumstances; they are in gene-
ral frugal and industrious.  Of those farms, one which hap-
pened to be let for only 19 years at L. 52 Sterling, and
which consists of about 170 acres, was let again within
these last 4 years at L. 120; and the present tenant being
a skilful and industrious farmer, is likely to make more
money than the former, who laboured in the old way.
Were the leases of the other farms expired, they could all
be let for more than twice the present rent.  In the south-
ern part of this parish, the farms are for the most part in-
closed.  Every farmer finding his account in breeding and
fattening cattle, raises annually several acres of turnip.
Wheat has long been cultivated in the southern, and which
is the most fertile part.  For the last 6 or 7 years, the far-
mers discontinued the sowing of this grain, several of them
having met with considerable losses by blasting.  But they
are now beginning to try it again, and have this year been
succesful.  Good artificial grass is also produced.  By an
article in their tacks, most of the tenants are bound to
have a third of their farms always in grass.  Much atten-
tion has of late years been paid to the raising of flax.  A-
bout 25 years ago, when a great proportion of the ground
consisted of natural pasture, every farmer had a large flock
of sheep.  At present, there are not in this parish above
2 or 3 who have sheep at all.  In the N. and N. W. parts
