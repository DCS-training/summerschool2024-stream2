and the bright verdure of the grass), open the main fur-
row against other 5 or 6, and thus go along the whole.
   When the ridges are much raise in the crown, as is still
the case in many parts of the country, the furrows must
be made in a different manner.  One communicating with
the first or great furrow must be drawn down the crown of
every ridge, unless it was cloven when laid down in grass.
From this again, at every 6 or 8 yards distance, others must
be made, pointing obliquely down the sides of the ridge,
till they meet and form an angle with others drawn in the
same manner on the next ridge, taking care, as in the case
above mentioned, that the plough throw the earth toward
the lower side.  The water is then let down into the
crown-furrows, and stopped at proper distances, so as to
make it spread over both sides of the ridge.
   It would be vain to attempt to give directions for eve-
ry particular situation or surface of ground.  The great
general rule is to draw your furrows in such a manner
as to distribute the water equally and plentifully over
every part.  By attending to this, and taking a careful
survey of the field, and intelligent ploughman will very
soon see what he has to do.  This also is to be attented to,
after the water is brought upon the ground, and it will re-
quire a daily visit from a careful hand with a spade, to re-
move obstructions that may have dropt into the furrows;
to place other properly; and to lead the water to such
heights and dry spots as many have been overlooked.  Mr
S. sometimes employed a man for this sole purpose.  It
is ever to be kept in mind, that it is only when made to
stand or stagnate on the ground, that water operates to ad-
vantage:  But whether this be by depositing on the soil
such rich particles, as make the immediate food on plants,
or by dissolving and macerating it; or which is most pro-
