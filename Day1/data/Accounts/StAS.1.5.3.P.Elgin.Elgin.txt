     of Elgyn.

charter, in the archives of the town, is from Alexander II.
anno 1234, who grants to the burgesses of Elgyn, a guild
of merchants, with as extensive privileges as any other  bo-
rough enjoys in Scotland.
   It was the policy of the sovereign, in the middle ages, to
give great privileges and immunities to the towns, for the
purpose of balancing the dangerous power, which had been
acquired by the nobles.  But when the regal government
became at any time feeble, these towns, unequal to their 
own protection, place themselves under the shelter of the 
most powerful lord in their neighbourhood.  Thus the 
town Elgyn found it necessary at various periods, be-
tween the years 1389 and 1452, to accept of many char- 
ters of protection, and discharges of taxes, from the Earls 
of Moray, who held it in some species of vassalage  At 
last, Charles I, in 1633, established and confirmed all the 
grants of his royal predecessors, in favour of the borough;
and the set, of form of its government, was ratified by the 
convention of borough, in 1706*. 

   Bishoprick.-At the beginning of the eleventh century,
the bishops in Scotland wore blue gowns, with their hair 
tucked under a cap+, and, having no particular diocese 
assigned them, were itinerant.  The precise time, that Mo-
ray was erected into a bishoprick, is uncertain, the char-
tulary going no farther back than the 1200; but it appears, 
that before that period, the bishops occasionally employed 
the churches of Bruneth or Birney, of Spyny and Kinnedor,
