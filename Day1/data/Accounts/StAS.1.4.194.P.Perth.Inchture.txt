barley, 36 bolls meal, and 34 bolls oats, and near L. 11

lincences to sell ale and British spirits.  In general, the
people here are sober and industrious.  Almost the whole
houses in this parish, have been built anew within these
16 years past.  The farmers houses are elegant, in compa-
rison of what they were of late years, and most of them
are covered with blue slate.  The lower class of people are
likewise much better lodged than they formerly were.
In the village called Balledgarno, Lord Kinnaird built
houses to accommodate 18 families, each of them having 2
fire apartments, in the course of last summer, all covered
with blue slate, and there is not more than the third part
