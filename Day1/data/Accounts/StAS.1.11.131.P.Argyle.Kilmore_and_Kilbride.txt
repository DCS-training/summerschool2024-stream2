schools, kept up at the expence of the inhabitants, in the re-
mote parts of the parish.

   Poor.-The poor are supported chiefly by the inhabitants
of the parish.  They beg from door to door; but are not
very troublesome in this way, although the funds are by no
means adequate to their numbers and wants:  The whole
amount, for many years, was from 12 L. to 14 L., arising from
the weekly collections, and from a small mortification or two.
But of late 32 L. 2 s. 3 1/4 d. was added by the commissioners of
the customs, 30 L. of which is laid out at interest, and the odd
money (2 L. 2 s. 3 1/4 d.) was distributed among the poor, at the
time when the order was given by the commissioners.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants has greatly in-
creased within the last 50 years:  For, notwithstanding that many
farms have been turned into grazings, yet such is the spirit of
improvement, in making roads, inclosures by stone walls
and ditches, building houses, etc. that the population, instead
of diminishing, has increased above a third within that period.
   It is difficult, however, to ascertain the exact number of the
inhabitants of both these parishes, as they are in a very fluc-
tuating state, by many annually going to the Low Country,
and from one part of this country to another; but from the
two last years lifts*, there appeared to be, at an average, of
inhabitants, of all ages,
