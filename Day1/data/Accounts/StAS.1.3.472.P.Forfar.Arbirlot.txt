well dissembled fly to catch the firmy race, have of late tried
the gun to kill the springing game.  This new fashion will, pro-
bably, soon be over.  For some years past, there has been, at
the mouth of the Elliot, a salmon fishery; but, either through
the negligence of the person who has the management, or
from the different run which that species of fish have taken,
very few are caught.  By the variety of trees and shrubs on
the banks of Elliot, which invite the several kinds of sing-
