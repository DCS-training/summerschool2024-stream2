40 s.  The whole land rent of the parish, as it now less, will be
about 800 l. or 900 l.

   Church and Stipend.-The church, from an inscription on
the front of it, appears to have been built in the year 1610.
The manse was built in 1729.  Both have undergone fre-
quent repairs.  The manse got a thorough repair in the
course of last year.  The stipend, at an average, is 70 l. per
annum, with a glebe of 20 acres.  Mr. Richardson of Pitsour
is patron.  He resides in the parish during summer.  The
only other heritor is Mr Craigie of Glendoich.

   Poor.-There are just 2 persons who receive at present a
stated allowance from the poor's funds.  They are both a-
bove 80 years of age.  Others receive occasional supplies,
when they happen to fall into distress, or meet with any mis-
fortune that demands a temporary aid.  But the people here,
in general, are rather backward to accept of any relief, unless
in cases of real necessity.  The contributions at the church
door, and other stated funds, amount to about 12 l. a year,
which, in general, is sufficient for every demand.  But there
is besides, a sum of upwards of 200 l. belonging to the poor,
lent out at interest, which is perpetually accumulating, and,
in all probability, never will be applied to the purposes for
which it was collected.

   School.-The salary of the parish schoolmaster is 100
merks.  The quarterly payment for reading, is 1 s.; for
writing and arithmetic, 2 s.; and for Latin, 3 s.  The num-
ber of scholars, at an average, is about 60, a considerable
part of whom come from neighbouring parishes.
