miles into the country, the two sides of which, with the
channel that divides the island of Bute from this part of
Cowal, present a sea-coast in this parish of above 3 miles.

   Lake, Fish, Surface and Soil.-Lochstreven abounds
with fish, viz. haddocks, whitings, small cod, flounders,
seath, and salmon; and in some seasons there have been re-
markable captures of herrings.  In the years 1789 and
1790, the herrings caught in Lochstreven, might be valued
at L. 3000 Sterling.  The surface of this parish is for the
most part rugged; a ridge of mountains rises with a steep a-
scent all along from the coast.  In some places, there are
small flat fields nigh the shore, but for the most part the a-
scent from the sea is immediate; and about half a mile a-
bove its level, the soil is thin and sandy, more calculated 
for grazing than tillage.  All the mountains, some years
ago, were covered with heath, but many of them now, by
being pastured with sheep, are mostly green, and it is 
likely, (from the rapid change that has already taken place,
in the appearance and value of these mountains, in this and
the neighbouring parishes), that the heath will soon be en-
tirely extirpated, and the value of the ground by that
means considerably increased.-It may be proper here to
add, that the extirpation of heath, and the production of 
grass in its room, very  much depends on a proper system
of burning the heath, which should always be done in the 
month of March or April; and if the ground burnt, is
kept free from cattle, for 18 months afterwards, the im-
provement is very great indeed, many new grasses spring-
ing up, from the enriching quality of the ashes of the
heath, which were never known before.  But, if the land
is too soon pastured on, the grasses are weak and tender,
and the sheep or cattle pull them up root and all, by which
the pasture is very materially injured.
