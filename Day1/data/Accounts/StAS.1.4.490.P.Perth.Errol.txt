   Village.-The village of Errol is the only place in the
parish, in which the number of buildings has lately in-
creased.  Its situation is remarkably pleasant.  Seated on
an eminence, rising by a gradual ascent above the level of
the country, the prospect from it is extensive and delight-
ful.  But the houses in the village are as paltry as the si-
tuation is pleasant.  As there is no stone in the neighbour-
hood, they are mostly built of clay, and huddled together,
without much order or regularity.  Excepting gentlemens

has increased in population.

   River Tay.-The country is intersected in different places
by small tracts of water, called pows, which move slowly
from the N. to the S. side of the carse, and which are col-
