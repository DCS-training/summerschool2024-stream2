at home; and it seems that this room was, for that use, kept by
the Abbot of Inshaffrey. All the rest of the country, being
twenty-five ploughs of land, are a regality by themselves, and
have the privileges and immunities usuall belonging to regalities,
appertaining in property to the Right Honourable the Knights of
Calder, Campbells, for the space of 200 years ago, and came to
be theirs in heritage after the manner following:-
  "This country, after it was doted to the Church by King Mal-
com Kenmore, and his religious Queen, Margaret, in testimony of
her thankfulness for the prayers of the Church, by which she ob-
tained from the Lord her son Edgar, so named after her brother
Edgar, King of England, who was expelled by King William
the Conqueror, whence it got the denomination of Maodh-edgarn,
or Meucarn corruptly,-it belonged to the Bishops of the Isles;
and ODe of these bishops called Ferquliard, sett the same in tack

the Bishop of the Isles a right, to this barony and regality of
Kilmaronag, or country of Muckairn, which the said priest did
carefully manage, both in assisting the advance of the money that
was given for it to the bishops and in obtaining the Pope's confir-
mation to the right, which was done by his legate, Sylvester
Darius, the last legate from the Pope in this kingdom. Thus,
having obtained a legal right, MacDougall, as he *
        the bishop out of it, thought also to do the same to the
knight, and by force to retain the possession of the country in his
own hand, many of his kindly men and followers inhabiting the
same, and himself very powerful in these bounds. After several
civil messages to MacDougall to no purpose, the knight, being
clothed with legal right and authority, is necessitated to possess
himself by force, and, having gathered a considerable party of
