ters to one stick at equal distances, which stick the driver
holds forcibly in both hands, while he himself walks general-
ly backwards, directly before the horses.
   Where the ground is steep, the mode of plowing is ex-
tremely tedious, being performed by what is called the side-
furrow; that is, where the horses cannot carry the draught
directly against the ascent, they go along-side the brae in an
oblique direction, plowing down the ground all towards one
side; and, in returning back, the plough cuts no ground,
but is carried empty.

   Soil, Climate and Diseases.-The soil is various.  That in
the height of the parish is thin, stony, and barren.  Along
the coast, though the soil is thin and light, it is not quite so
unfertile; it is in general gravellish, or consists of a black
light earth.
   All the west coast, but particularly Kintail, is subject almost

dry weather to be looked for is from the middle or latter end
of May to the middle of September, when the rains general-
ly set in.  The snow is seldom of long duration on the sea-
coast, and here the frost is not felt so keen as in inland coun-
tries.
   The diseases most prevalent among the inhabitants of this
place are rheumatisms, sciatics, and ruptures.  They are daily
exposed to damps and rains, which are believed to be the

heavy weights which the men are in use of raising on their
breasts when they back-load their horses; for, owing to the
roughness of the country, and there being no roads, no
waggon or cart can be used for any distance.

living in the parish three men and a woman who exceed 80,
