     Statistical Account

thirty men, or more, are employed in this fishery.
There is also a salmon fishing upon the coast, called
stell fishing.  Some thousands of salmon are sent to Lon-
don early in the season, covered with ice:  Afterward
they are exported in kits steeped in vinegar, of which
many hogsheads are yearly laid in for the purpose.  These
kits contain about 36 pounds of salmon each.  When the
great city is plentifully supplied, and the price much re-
duced, it becomes convenient to salt the salmon, and to
send them to the foreign markets.  The natural effect
of this demand, is dearth of salmon here.  Indeed, the
expense of living has increased very considerably with-
in these 20 years in almost every article.  In this we
are not singular.

   Proprietors.-The Duke of Gordon is our only resi-
ding heritor, and, indeed, sole proprietor of the parish,
except of one farm belonging to the Earl of Findlater.

   Population, etc.-The return to Dr. Webster in 1755,
was 1730.  The parish of Bellie now contains 1919
souls, viz. country part 984, and the village 935.  Of
these, there are 859 males, and 1060 females.  This
disproportion has not been occasioned by emigration, for
of that we have had very few instances, but from the
military genius exerting itself on particular emergen-
cies.  We have of married couples 272, and of young
people about 10 years old, and under, 437, viz. 205 boys,
and 232 girls.  Though it be known, that a superior
number of males is born into the world, these little
differences will happen in particular corners, by remo-
vals and other causes.  For 14 years past, 10 couples, at
a medium, have been married yearly, and 31 children
