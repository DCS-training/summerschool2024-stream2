   Distilleries.-There are 7 licensed stills, of 30 gallons each,
in this parish, yielding an annual revenue of 315 L.; but
consuming a very considerable proportion of the produce.
It is much to be regretted that the price of ardent spirits
has not risen in this part of the country, in proportion to
the advance of tax.  The distillers having in general no ca-
pital, are frequently under a necessity of selling their whisky
at a considerable disadvantage; and the number who are
thus situated, supply our confined market so abundantly,
that those who are possessed of capitals cannot avail them-
selves of them by a retention of the commodity, until the
advance in price should yield a reasonable profit.  Of conse-
quence, while barley sells, as it now does, at a guinea per
boll, the price of the gallon is only 3 s.  and it is actually re-
tailed in our dram houses at 3 s.  8 d.  which is no more than
it sold for before the last additional 50 per cent.  was levied
on each still.  Hence it is evident, that that tax has no effect
in rendering spirits more inaccessible to the lower ranks, and
that it is principally, if not altogether, paid by the distiller
out of his profits, not by the consumer; how far he is able
to afford this will be seen thus: The quantity of barley al-
lowed to be distilled by each possessor of a 30 gallon still, is
188 1/2, so that 4 bolls, the quantity usually distilled at a time,
