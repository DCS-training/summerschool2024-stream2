of contribution to the ability of the inhabitants.  It continued for
several years to bear the character of a poor-house rather than a
house of industry;-till, in 1833, it was thought expedient, from
various causes, to abolish the institution;-and, in a few years af
terwards, the entire management of the poor of the parish was
placed in the hands of the heritors and kirk-session, as provided
for in the statute.  The average expense for the support of the
charity work-house, including its out-door paupers, was usually
about L.500 per annum.
  Besides the charity work-house, various other societies have
been formed for the relief of the poor. The Indigent Sick So-
ciety was formed in 1808; the Old Women's Society in 1814:
the Clothing Society, for sup 'lying work to industrious poor wo-
men, in 1837.

Youths' in 1811; the Buccleuch Carters' in 1828; the Recha-
