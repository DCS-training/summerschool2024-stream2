up every year.  About 1200 acres are yearly in crop, which
consists mostly of oats, barley, and potatoes; wheat, pease,
and turnips, though there are a share of them also, not being
general crops.  It is probable, however, from some experi-
ments lately made, that wheat will often be adopted in place
of barley, especially where the soil is strong and heavy.  A
considerable quantity of shell marl has been found in the
parish, but is mostly exhausted.  The center of the parish
being only five miles from a convenient sea-port, lime may be
had from England at a reasonable rate.  The tenants have
not hitherto been much in use of sowing grass-seeds, but are
now coming fast into practice.  More clover has been sown
in the parish this last year than for many former years all
put together.

   Cattle and Sheep.-There are about 200 horses in the pa-
rish, young ones not fit for service being included.  There
are about 2000 black cattle, and upwards of 2000 sheep, of
the black faced Scots breed, which are kept upon the hills,
and whose fleeces, at an average, do not weigh more than
three pounds English.  A few sheep of the Yorkshire and
Northumberland breed, kept on the low lands, produce fleece
which weigh from six to ten pounds English each, of excel
lent wool.  Some singular sheep produce a great deal more.
These sheep do not thrive upon the hills; nor are the
sheep any thing improven by being crossed with the English
rams.  The late John Dalziel of Barncrosh, a gentleman
who bestowed great pains in improving the breed of black
cattle and sheep in this country, tried the experiment in a
farm he possessed in this parish; but it had a very different
effect from what he expected.  The wool of the brood of
these English rams was coarse and shaggy, and the sheep
themselves ill-shaped and unhardy.
