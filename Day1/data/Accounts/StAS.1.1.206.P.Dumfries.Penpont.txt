     Statistical Account

the last 15 years, has been increased L. 900.  There are
many inclosures; and the disposition to inclose seems to in-
crease.

   Rivers, etc.-Near the Scarr, which rises at the head of
Penpont, are likewise the sources of the Ken, whose course
extends to Kirkcudbright; of Afton, which falls into the
Nith near New Cumnock; and of the Youghan, which joins
the Nith at Sanquhar.  The Scarr runs down the middle of
the parish 12 miles, and for 6 more divides it from Tynron
and Keir.  A vast water spout, accompanied with tremen-
dous thunder and lightning, emptied itself near the source of
the Scarr in July 1783.  Every one here was surprised by an
uncommon flood in the evening.  Herds of cattle, and their
keepers, were suddenly surrounded:  People at work were
obliged to flee for fear of being inclosed.  Hay and timber
were carried off; one stone bridge and a horse, with the wool
of 1200 sheep, were swept away:  Dreadful gulphs of whole
acres were made on the face of the hills.  There are 15 brooks
in this parish.  The fish in the rivers or brooks are salmon,
caught chiefly in July and August, and sold at 3 d. per lb.;
sea-trout; hirlings, caught in the same months; burn-trout,
pikes, eels, and parts.  Dowloch is a small lake on the top
of a hill, and famous, in the reign of superstition, for curing
all manner of diseases.  Those who resorted to it for relief
left some part of their dress to the guardian demon or saint.
By all accounts it has some mineral qualities.

   Population.-The population of this parish has increased up-
wards of 100 within these 15 years, owing chiefly to the di-
vision of some large farms.  The return to Dr Webster, how-
ever, was 857.
