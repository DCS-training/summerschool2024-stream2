bath in Gaelic, and the other in English.  The funds
for the maintenance of the poor, who are very numerous*,
are the weekly collections at the churches, the Marine So-
ciety, and the trades boxes.  These being inadequate, and
to put a stop to vagrant begging, with which the town was
intolerably infested, the inhabitants of both parishes, in
1785, agreed to assess themselves in a sum that might sup-
ply the deficiency.  The scheme, which is conducted as
the law directs, has been continued; and, but for the
simplicity of people who still give encouragement to va-
grants, would completely answer its important end.
The sum raised by assessment from the beginning has
not greatly increased.  The assessment for 1791 was
L. 360.  Where there are many separate funds for the 
maintenance of the poor, it is not to be supposed, that
an equal distribution can be made.  It is therefore
much to be wished, that as many of them as possibly could,
were thrown into one, for the benefit of the indigent.  The
annual amount of charities, in Greenock, is not less, it is
believed, than L. 1200 Sterling.
   The Merchants House Society in Greenock was establish-
ed in 1787.  The subscription money on admission is
L. 5, 5 s. and 5 s. annually.  No part of the fund is to be
expended, till the stock amount to L. 1000, when the in-
terest may be distributed in charities among the decayed
members.

   Churches, etc.-The church and manse of Greenock
were not built till the year 1759.  The stipend is 100
guineas per annum, exclusive of the manse and garden.

*One cause of this is the senseless profusion, with which many of the
common sailors squander their money.  One of them who, soon after the
commencement of the American war, received L. 1800 of prize-money,
spent it all in about two years; and dying, less some young children to be
maintained by the parish.
