   The increase in population, which is chiefly in the village,
is owing partly to the neighbouring farmers not inclining to

tradesmen or day labourers.  The great increase of manufac-
tures, has also encouraged many young men to follow that
line of life, who continue to reside as tradesmen within the
town.

   Manufactures.-The principal manufacture, is weaving
coarse brown linens, of different fabrics.  The weavers are
chiefly employed by the merchants of Dundee in manufactur-

country use.  The women's work is generally spinning the
