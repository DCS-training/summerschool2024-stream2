     of Montrose.

   State of Property, etc.-The country part of the parish, be-
sides many small feus, is divided onto eight larger properties;
of these, the estate of Kinnabar, which once belonged to the
family of Montrose, one of whose titles, to this day, is Baron
of Kinnabar, is the most considerable.  It is rendered more
valuable by the fishing, and the improvement of some waste
ground.  The present mansion-house is undergoing consi-
derable repairs, and lies in a romantic elevated situation,
surrounded by trees.  The soil of Kinnabar, and of the estates of
Charleton, Newmanswalls, Borrowfield, and Hedderwick,
is, in general, very good, and cultivated with spririt, accor-
ding to the best schemes of modern improvers.  Even where
the low lands have a light soil, as they have long received
town manure, they are very productive of all kinds of
grain and turnips, especially, when, before breaking up, they
are clayed upon the grass.  The upper grounds, are, inm
general, of a thin and muirish soil, but much improved
of late, by the above manurs, and lime from the adjoining
parish 

   The valued rent amounts to L.2200 Scotch, or L.183,
6 s. 8 d. Sterling.  There are in the parish about 3080 acres
occupied as follows:
