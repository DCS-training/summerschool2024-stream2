standing of his Majesties proclamation, several persons in this pa-
rish have, upon Tuesday, 25th December, invaded and robbed my
house, taken away my armes and books, some of these per-
sons being under public scandals, at least, the ringleaders of them,
and that, though they escape punishment from men, yet the Lord
our God will not suffer them to escape his righteous judgment."
   The above excerpts from the session-records clearly shew that
Mr Robb declined the friendly offer made him by Mr Muschett;
but it is afterwards recorded that, of 30 persons who were excom-

Young, &c.
