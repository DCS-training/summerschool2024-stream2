     PARISH OF INVERCHAOLAIN,

     (COUNTY OF ARGYLE.)

     By the Rev. Mr HUGH MACTAVISH, Minister.

     Name, Situation and Extent.

   INVERCHAOLAIN is derived from the Gaelic language,
inver, signifying fit for crop, or inner, (as it is some-
times spelt), fit for tillage, and caolain, or caolamhain, a 
small water or rivulet.  This etymology of Inverchaolain
is very descriptive of the place, being a plain at the foot of
a rivulet, fit for tillage or cultivation.  It is situated in the
district of Cowal*, and shire of Argyll.  It is intersected by
an arm of the sea, called Lochstreven, which runs about 8

<FOOTNOTE>

*It has been humorously observed, since flocks of sheep have expelled
the droves of cows, which formerly were kept in this part of the country,
that the district should be called Sheep-all, instead of Cow-all; but the
word Cowal is derived from the Gaelic, and not from the English.
