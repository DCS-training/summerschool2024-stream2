Thomas Ker in Old Roxburgh, and James Scot of South Synton-
mill, was "delated for sustaining of the process of excommunica-
tion, and contravening of the acts of Parliament in baptising of
bairns and making of marriages without any function," From the
presbytery records it appears, that, for some time previous to 1666,
attempts had been made to remove the church to Roberton; for
of that date there is an entry of the report of a committee to the
Archbishop of Glasgow, bearing, that "advantage bad been taken
of the pupilarity of the deceased Mary Duchess of Buccleuch, to
whom the greater part of the parish belonged, and of the confu-
sions under the late usurpation, to procure a warrant from the same
usurpers for changing the seat of the said kirk at Hassendean, and
building ane new kirk at Roberton, and that they did according-
ly build the said new kirk at the west end of said parish." At
length in 1690, the church was wholly suppressed, not, however,
without so determined an opposition on the part of the parishioners
as to make it necessary to call in the aid of the Sheriff of the
county, an ancestor of the family of Cavers; and it is related that,
on this occasion, an old woman threatened him with the judg-
ment of Heaven on account of his sacrilegious work, denouncing
the extinction of the male line of the family.  It is to this tradition
that Leyden alludes in the lines,

      Then circles many a legendary tale
      Of Douglas race foredoomed without a male,
      To fade unblessed, since in the churchyard green,
      Its Lord o'erthrew the spires of Hazeldean.-

 From the site of the old building being exposed to the encroach-
ments of the Teviot, it became gradually dilapidated, but the
churchyard was still continued for burying up to 1796, when an
unusually high flood tore open the graves, and made it necessary to
remove the remains of the dead.  The river has continued to alter
its bed, till it appears, from measurements in the possession of the
proprietor of Hassendean-burn, that the site of the old church, for-
merly on a projecting point on the north bank, is now marked by a
sand bank on the opposite side, nearly in a line with the termination
of a garden wall.
   Antiquities.-In common with the greater part of the south of
Scotland, this parish formerly contained several towers of strength
or border peels, but these, with a fate which has been too fre-
quent, have, for the most part, been removed.  That of Horsley-
hill has long disappeared, and only a fragment of one wall remains
at Hassendean, forming the gable end of a cottage.  The tower
