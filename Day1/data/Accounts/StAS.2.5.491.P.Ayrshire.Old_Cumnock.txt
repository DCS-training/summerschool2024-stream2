varies from 3s. to 10s., according to the urgency of the case. The
average sum is 5s. or 6s. each per month.  The total sum
distributed by the kirk-session last year was L. 105, 13s. 2 1/2d.
The sources from which this sum was obtained were, church col-
lections, L. 66, 12s. 6 1/4d.; voluntary assessment on the heritors,
L. 30; rent of some seats in church, L. 7, 16s.
   There is a mortification of L. 25 annually, under the manage-
ment of the heritors and minister, which is given to needy persons
who are not on the poor's roll. A large quantity of meal is distri-
buted annually by the Marquis of Bute, to poor persons in this
parish, in regular allowance, once a fortnight.
   Either to ask or to obtain relief from the poor's funds is by no
means regarded in so degrading a light as it was wont to be.
There is a sad decline of late years in the spirit of independence
that used to exist; and relief from the kirk-session is now received
more as a matter of legal right than as a gratuity.
   Fairs.--There are four annual fairs held in the town, in Fe-
bruary, May, July, and October, O. S.
   Inns, &c.--There are two inns in the town, and thirteen houses
where ardent spirits are sold. These latter have considerably de-
creased within these four or five years; but there are still by far
too many of them, and their effects on the morals of the people are
most injurious.
   It was very much the custom sometime ago to give half a dozen
rounds, or more, of spirits, wine, &c. at funerals; but there has
been a decided improvement in this respect, of late years; and, in
many cases, the giving of spirits is now wholly discontinued on
such occasions.
   Fuel.--Abundance of coal is to be bad in the parish and neigh-
bourhood. The price is about 5s. per ton at the pit; and laid
down in the town, about 8s. per ton.
