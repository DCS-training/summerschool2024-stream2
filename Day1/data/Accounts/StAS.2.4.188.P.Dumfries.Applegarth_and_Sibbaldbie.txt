	Breeds of Live Stnbj.--Except on one dairy farm, where the
stock is Ayrshire, the cattle kept here are of the Galloway breed.
They are well suited for this country, being hardy, good feeders,
capable of attaining to a large size, and much in request for the
markets in Norfolk, Suffolk, &e. where they are fattened for Smith-
field. Much attention has of late years been paid to the improve-
ment of these animals in this parish as in the rest of the district,
and we now rival Galloway itself in the purity of our breed and
the symmetry of our bullocks. This improvement has been effected
by the introduction of the most approved stock from their indige-
nous pastures by the allurement of high prices for their bulls and
cows. Of sheep, the Cheviot breed constitutes the stock on the
hill pasture in the parish, while on the lower and arable lands there
are some small stocks of the Leicester breed. But the chief pur-
pose for which any species of this kind of stock is kept here being
to eat off the turnip crop, and for which Highland wedders are ge-
nerally purchased, equal attention in breeding sheep to that be-
stowed on black cattle is not paid.
	Husbandry.--The course of husbandry pursued is the system in
more or less perfection, of alternate white and green crops, though
in many instances with a considerable portion of the farm in pas-
ture. This is rendered necessary by the pretty extensive rearing
of cattle. Turnips have been, for the last few years, cultivated
largely, and consumed on the ground by sheep,--a valuable inno-
vation on the old system, and one which has increased materially
the produce of corn crops. If any "specialty " distinguishes the agri-
culture of the parish, it is the quantity of pork produced. Through-
out all Annandale this is an important article of commerce, and by
