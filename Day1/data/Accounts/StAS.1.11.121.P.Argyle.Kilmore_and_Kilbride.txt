     NUMBER VIII.

     UNITED PARISHES OF KILMORE AND
     KILBRIDE.

     (County and Synod of Argyll-Presbytery of Lorn.)

     By the Rev. Mr. PATRICK McDONALD, Minister.

     Origin of the Names.

   THE oldest etymology of KILMORE, is Kil-moire: Oy, or
Oigh, signifying, in ancient Gaelic, the church, or place of
worship, of the blessed Virgin.  It was also called Kilmheanach,
or the middle burial place, from being in the centre of the coun-
try.  Lately it has been called Kilmor, that is, the great burying
place, (mor signifying great or large), because the burial
ground around this church was formerly of greater extent,
than any other in this part of the country.  KILBRIDE is also
derived from the same root, Kil, and signifies a burial place,
or place of worship, dedicated to St. Bridget.  The church was,
rebuilt about 50 years ago.  It is supposed to have been
joined to the parish of Kilmore, at the union of many other
parishes in the Highlands, under the charge of one minister.
Kilbride was a vicarage, and Kilmore a parsonage.
