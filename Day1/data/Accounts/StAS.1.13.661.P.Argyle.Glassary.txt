particularly in the winter season, very irregular*.  The
manse was built in 1763; its situation is damp; and 
though reckoned a good one when built, (there being at
the time few manfes built in the country), it was neither
substantially built nor finished, and now requires a repair.
The living consists of 80 bolls of meal, 9 bolls small oats,
L. 45 Sterling, with a manfe and glebe, consisting of six
acres arable Scotch measure, and a servitude of 8 foums grass
upon the adjacent farm:  value, communibus annis, L. 120
Sterling.  Mr Campbell of Knockbuy, one of the principal
heritors, is patron.-There is a parochial school, which 30
or 40 years ago was good and respectable; but since private 
education become fashionable, it is on the decline.  There 
is a catechist, with a salary from the Royal bounty, in the
braes of this and the neighbouring parish; and in the lower
end there is a sewing and knitting mistress, with a salary
from the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge,
and the incumbent expects against May to have a school
upon Lochfinefide, with a salary from the Society, a place
in which there was one formerly, and is still very necessary
for the good of the parish.

   Poor.-The poor have no other fund than the Sunday
collections; a fund very inadequate to supply their wants,

*Though the incument mentioned the attention of the heritors to the
melioration, and beautifying of their estates, he cannot pay them the same
compliment with regard to the church, for they seem to have absorbed
every ecclesiastical consideration in improving their properties, and aug-
menting their annual income.  The church when built was among the
best in the county; but it has the fault of all old churches, that of being
long and narrow, which renders it very inconvenient.  It was twice par-
tially repaired within these 30 years, and stands now in need of a thorough
one, owing to the economy of the heritors upon these occasions.
