parish, as well as the adjacent country, are deprived of ables-

ed to purchase fuel from a considerable distance, at a higher
price, and of a worse quality.  To this essential, and seem-
ingly irremediable grievance, may be added mill thirlages,

     KING'S MUIR.

   Name, Privileges, Ect.  This is a very extensive tract of
ground, containing more than 1000 acres.  It is called King's
Muir, on account of its being, some time after the restoration of
Charles II conferred by that Prince upon one Col. Borthwick,
who had attended him in his adventures and exile, previously to
his attainment of the throne, as a reward for his attachment
and services.  This is the account given of its origin by Mr.
Hanno, the present proprietor.  Most of the ground of this
ancient royal donation is, as its name insinmates, extremely
wild in appearance; though, upon the whole, much less un-
fertile than might be expected.  The proprietor, however,
is of opinion, that, taking all of it together, it is not worth
more than 1 s. 6 d. an acre; while others rate it much higher.
It is wholly exempt from assessment; and the circumstanceof
its not yielding either minister's stipend or schoolmaster's sa-
lary, seems, in the conjectures of many, to have classed it
with no parish whatever.  Its inhabitants have, nevertheless,
either from their vicinity to our church, or the popularity of
its ministers, always considered themselves as parishioners of
Denino, in the most decided preference to Crail; in whose
parish they are asserted, by a few, to be legally' included.  As
the present laird of King's Muir had not hill charter by him.
