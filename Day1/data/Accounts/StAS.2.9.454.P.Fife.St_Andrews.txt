   Hydrography.-Springs are to be found in the various districts
of the parish; but with the exception of one nearly a mile to the
east of the city, at the foot of the rocky eminence which skirts
the ocean, and another on the lands of Bonytoun, both of which
are impregnated with iron, they have nothing remarkable in their
appearance or properties. The temperature of a well, at the
depth of 21 feet below the surface of the ground, in the immediate
vicinity of St Salvator's College, was carefully examined by Dr
Jackson, during the years 1821, 1822, and 1823, when its medium
was found to be 46\d1.951, Fahrenheit, while the medium tempera-
ture of the air for the same years was 47\d1.265.
   Two small streams have their origin in the parish, and fall into
the sea, the one on the south-east, and the other on the north-west
of the city. The course of the larger does not exceed five miles;
it passes through the harbour, after having previously communi-
cated motion to the machinery of several corn-mills. The other
stream is much smaller, and is not applied to any useful purpose.
The Eden, which forms the northern boundary of the parish for
about four miles, and which enters the German Ocean a mile and
a-half to the north of the city, has altogether a course of about
twenty-five miles. And the course of the Kenly, which forms
another of the parish boundaries, is from six to eight miles. The
tide flows up the Eden about four miles, when its farther progress,
except at high spring tides, is prevented by Nydie mill-dam, which
forms the boundary of the parish in that direction. For nearly
the half of this distance, it has a considerable estuary, which is co-
vered by the sea at high water, and is then navigable for vessels
of an hundred or an hundred and twenty tons. But when the
tide retires, the greater part of it presents a surface of soft mud
and sand. As the course of the river through it is winding, and
as there is also a bar at the entrance from the sea, the assistance
