and that the one blew his trumpet, and the other flourished his co-
lours in sight of the English army, who, apprehending that the
Scottish force were immediately upon them, were so much affright-
ed, that they fled out of the country. For which achievement,
King Robert gave Hunter the lands of Balagan, and to M'Gachen
the lands of Dalwhat. If this tradition be true, the family of Bala-
gan would appear to be a very old one. The last of them, it is
said, usually contended with James Menzies of Enock for prece-
dency. But the family is now extinct. It terminated with three
daughters, one of whom was married to--Hunter, of Polmood,
in Twedddale; another to James Graham, of Shaw, in the parish
of Hutton, in Annandale; and the third to William Charteris, of
Brigmoor, Commissary of Dumfries.
	Families of Douglas of Dalveen and Douglas of Cashogle.--Two
other ancient families who had their estates and residences in the
parish of Durisdeer, were Douglas of Dalveen and Douglas of Cash-
ogle. They were both cadets of the house of Drumlanrig. All
these lands are now in the possession of the noble family of Queens-
berry.
 	There are only three other land-owners in the parish; and their
properties are small.
        ParOchial Register.--The date of the earliest entry in the parish
register is 20th July 1758. It was formerly kept very irregularly.
	Antiquities.--About a mile above the church, in the wall path,
there are the vestiges of a Roman camp, which appears to have
been a summer station connected with the great one at Tibbers, to
guard the pass from Lanarkshire. A Roman road passed along
the wall path referred to into Crawford moor to Biggar.
	The castle of Drumlanrig, built about the end of the seventeenth
century, is the only mansion-house, if so it may be called, in the
parish.
