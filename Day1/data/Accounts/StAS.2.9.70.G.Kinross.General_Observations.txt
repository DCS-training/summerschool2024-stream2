                     GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

                   ON THE COUNTY OF KINROSS.

   Sir ROBERT SIBBALD, in his History of Fife and Kinross, tells
us, that, in the ancient language of the Picts, the county of Fife
was called Ross, "which signifieth a peninsula," and adds, "that
the upper part of this territory, formed by the Friths of Forth and
Tay, got the name of Kean-Ross, which means the head of the
peninsula."  He does not, however, adduce a shadow of evidence
to satisfy us that the county of Fife was at any period called Ross;
and we are rather inclined to suppose, that the origin of the word
Kinross arose entirely from some local circumstance.
    This county lies between 3&deg; 14' and 3&deg; 35' west longitude, and
between 56&deg; 9' and 56&deg; 18' north latitude.  From the eastmost
point at Auchmoor Bridge over the River Leven to the westmost
part, where it is bounded by the Devon, it does not exceed twelve
miles in extent; and from Kelty-Bridge, on the south to Damhead
on the north, is scarcely ten.  The area of the whole county
does not exceed seventy square miles, or 44,800 imperial acres;
and thus it is one of the smallest shires in Scotland.  It is bound-
ed on the north, by the Ochil-hills, which separate the district
from Strathearn; on the east, by the Lomond-hills; and the south-
east and south-west boundaries run partly along the summit of Be-
narty, and partly along the flat ground to a point on Kelty-burn,
whence the Cleish-hills, extending to the west, divide it from Fife.
Thus, though the boundaries are generally hilly, there is a level
opening at Blair-Adam, between Benarty and the Cleish-hills,
through which the great north road passes; there is another open-
ing to the north-east, between the Ochil and Lomond-hills, lead-
ing towards Cupar-Fife; and a third level, more extensive than
any of the former, opens to the west towards Stirling, at the Crook
of Devon.  In addition to these, there is a narrow pass through
which the River Leven flows from the loch.
   Previous to the year 1426, the greater part of this county was
