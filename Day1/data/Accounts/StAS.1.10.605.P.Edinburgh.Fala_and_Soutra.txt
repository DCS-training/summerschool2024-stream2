scarcity of hands, and the high rate of wages, which makes
them at once independent and insolent.

   Poor.-The poor, at present upon the roll, are far from

the funds for supporting them are wonderfully slender  They
solely arise from the perquisites of a mort-cloth, which is so
very ragged that nobody will use it; and the collections at
the church door, which may amount, upon an average, to
1 s. every Sunday.  This may be thought a very small col-
lection, from the number of parishioners already stated; but
it will not be found to be so very small, when we consider,
that, in this part of the country, it is only fashionable for the
lower classes of the people to attend the church.  The higher
orders are above the vulgar prejudices, of believing it necessa-
ry to worship the God of their fathers.  They have long
adopted the philosophy of France, in esteeming religion an
useless burden to the state.

   School, etc.-The schoolmaster's salary is not the largest
in Scotland, being only 2 L. 4 s. 4 d.  The school fees are in
proportion.  English is 1 s. 6 d. writing 2 s. and arithmetic
