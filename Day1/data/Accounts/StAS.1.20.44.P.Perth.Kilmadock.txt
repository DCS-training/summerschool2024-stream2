barley, with grass-seeds, which is found to be an excellent
rotation.
   Hills.-Although the grounds of the parish rise from
the level of the Forth, to a great height on the north
boundary, yet they cannot, properly, be called hilly
ground.  The ascent is regular and progressive, and carri-
ages of all sorts may be conveyed to any part, except the
hill on the north.  The proper name of this hill is Uaigh-
mor, signifying great cave, or den; there being a cave in
the rock, on the south side of the hill, which was formerly
the haunt of robbers.  These were only extirpated about
40 or 50 years go.

   Woods.-There are very few plantations, or natural
woods.  The heritors of this parish are extremely careless
of planting.  Nothing is more friendly to agriculture, in a
cold climate, than warming the fields by woods, and stripes
of planting; and the pleasures of the imagination are much
refined by the prospect of romantic woods and groves; be-
sides, when such immense sums are annually remitted to
Norway, etc. for timber, there is an absolute necessity for
attending to useful plantations at home.  In short, the culti-
vation of forest trees, unites in itself economy, profit, and
beauty.  Yet, strange to tell, the whole of this parish ap-
pears almost totally barren of planting.  There is no district,
perhaps, in Scotland, that affords greater scope for useful,
as well as ornamental planting, than the parish of Doune:
Large tracks of moor, unfit for any cultivation, or for pro-
ducing even grass, which would raise all kinds of fir; and
there are multitudes of waste corners, through the arable
grounds, that might be usefully employed in raising all sorts
of timber.  In a very short space of time the grounds would
wear a different aspect, and agriculture be much improved.
