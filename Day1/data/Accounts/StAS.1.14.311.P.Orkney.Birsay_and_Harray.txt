     NUMBER XIX.

     UNITED PARISHES OF BIRSAY AND HARRAY.

     (COUNTY AND SYNOD OF ORKNEY, PRESBYTERY OF
     CAIRSTON.)

     By the Rev. Mr. GEORGE LOW.

     PARISH OF BIRSAY.

     Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, etc.

It is impossible for me to ascertain the ancient namo
of the parish, except from the Icelandic historians;
where we find, by Torfaeus's History of Orkney, that
St. Magnus, Earl and Saint of Orkney, was killed at
Eagleshay, upon the spot that we believe now the kirk
is erected, which is a steepled kirk.  In Torfaeus's His-
tory, the parish is called In provincia de Byrgisherad.
In Ionaei Orknyinga saga, the name is much the same.
After St. Magnus's death, he was brought from Eagle-
shay, and buried in the cathedral of Birsay*.  These  
Icelandic historians speak much of the many miracles
