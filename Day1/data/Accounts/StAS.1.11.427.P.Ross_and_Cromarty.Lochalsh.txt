     of Lochalsh.

   Rents, Fuel, etc.-The valued rent of the parish is not ex-
actly known.  The real rent is nearly 800 L. Sterling, besides
what arises from a considerable quantity of kelp annually ex-
ported. This estate has remained in the same family for up-
wards of 4 centuries.-The only fuel used is peats, which, in
wet seasons, in this rainy climate, are expensive and precari-
ous. Necessity has sometimes obliged them to purchase coals,
at the extravagant rate of 19 s. per ton.  It is to be hoped
the justice of the British legislature will not suffer a country,
where firing must always constitute one of the most essential
comforts of life, to groan any longer under a partial and ini-
quitous tax on that necessary articles*.-The Gaelic is the only
language, in which public instruction is conveyed to the peo-
ple; though, from the introduction of Society schools, and a
stronger desire in the people to have their children educated,
most of them are now taught to read and write.

   Wild Animals.-Red deer, mountain hares, and tarmagan,
frequent the higher hills. In the lower, may be found roes,
foxes, black-cocks, grouse, plovers, partridges, eagles, and a
variety of hawks. The migratory birds are the wood-cock,
lapwing, cuckoo, land rail, swallow, and mountain finch, or-
snow-stake.  The sea coast abounds with a variety of water
fowl.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The parish derives its
principal advantage from its local situation on the sea coast, so
contiguous to the bays of Lochduich, Lochcarron, Kishorn,
and Lochorn, some one of which, and generally all of them,
shoals of herrings never fail to visit between the end of June
and the beginning of November.  From benefiting by this
advantage, they are, however, in a great measure prevented,
