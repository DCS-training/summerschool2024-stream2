lambs, were killed by the different butchers.  There is here
also a considerable tannery, and a small manufacture of locks
and nails.  A good many looms are employed in the parish,
but chiefly for private use, though a few do what is called
factory work.  One only weaves muslin.

   Collieries.-Besides the small seam of coal already mention-
ed, wrought for the supply of the distillery, there are other
3 collieries in the parish, Tranent, Elphingstons and Birsley.

feet thick, at the depth of 32 and 25 fathoms, according to
the ascent and descent of the surface.  Below this is a seam
about 5 feet thick; and there are different small strata above,
at present not worth the working.

proportion of the parishioners either belong to, or are con-
nected with, the collieries.  The influence they have in
forming the manners of the lower classes, is of course consi-
derable; and, according to their frugal or extravagant way of
life, the poor's funds are more or less burdened.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The church is a very ancient, incom-
modious, and unhealthy fabric.  No account of its antiquity
is any where to be found; but most people skilled in archi-
tecture have little hesitation in pronouncing it 500 or 600
years old.  The outward form resembles 3 oblong buildings,
