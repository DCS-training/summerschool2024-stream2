smiths, 38 male and 13 female weavers, 1 wright,
or joiner, 6 boat carpenters, 2 coopers, 14 tailors, 7
brogue, or shoemakers, 6 cowans, or dry stone build-
ers, and 5 merchants.  There are also 5 change, or

   Churches, Stipend, Schools, &c.-There are the ruins of
7 or 8 small edifices in this parish, which, in all proba-
