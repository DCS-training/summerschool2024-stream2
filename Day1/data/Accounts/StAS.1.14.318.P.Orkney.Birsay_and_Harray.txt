rally badly horned:  We, however, sell a good num-
ber, which are either slaughtered for shipping, or pick-
led and sent to Leith in barrels, together with their
hide and tallow.  The prices, at an average, are about
181.  Scots, which rise and fall according  to the de-
mand at market, particularly for hides and tallow,
which settles the price.

   Population.-The return to Dr. Webster in 1755,
for Birsay and Harray, was 2200 souls*.  As to the
present population, etc. of the parish, it will appear
from the following

<FOOTNOTE>

*As to the number of the people, we have traced it for 100 years;
but we suppose, the books have been ill kept, because we see the differ-
ence of marriages and baptisms in some years is very great, which
we shall account for.  About 110 year ago, namely, in the eighties,
commonly called Brand's years, an universal sterility prevailed in Ork-
ney, when the people died in hundreds; the lands were laid waste for
want of strength both of man and  beast, and no seed; may of the best
places were totally relinquished; and the miserable skeletons of these
ridges may be seen to this day.  Even when they began to recover them-
selves, they were not able to manage their usual possessions, but just
cut away the sward of the one part to put upon the top of the other,
for want of manure; and thus the cafe appears till this very day.

<TABLE>

   Marriages in 1680 none.
   In 1681 only 4.   Baptisms,   11.
   In 1690     11.   Baptisms,   14.

As to the population of the parish, it will be seen by the foregoing
list, and those that will follow.  It has been fluctuating, for reasons that
will be shown hereafter.  The people at that time were perfectly sta-
tionary, and even laws were made for restricting them from leaving their
own country, or even going aboard of ships:  which had a very good
effect in keeping people at home for recovering their state of defolation.
But now the cafe is, for the better, otherwise.
