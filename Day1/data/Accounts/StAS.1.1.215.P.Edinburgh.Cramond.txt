which is at the rate of above 87 s. an acre; so that the land
rent is equal to about two-fifths of the produce.

   Crops.-Hay is the principal article raised in this district, the
great demand for that commodity at Edinburgh, securing a
constant market.  It is produced from red and yellow clover-
seed, mixed with rye grass, and is cut early.  The frequent
repetition of this crop has lessened the returns; formerly 8 
or 10 pounds of clover-seed, along with 2 bushels of rye-
grass, were sufficient for an acre, and produced great crops
two years successively; now it is found difficult to raise hay
the second year, although double the quantity of clover-seed
is used.  These seeds are sown with the foregoing crop of
barley, wheat, or oats, the ground being well pulverized.
Hay is a great favourite of the farmers, being an article easy
to dispose of, and cheaply reaped; the expence of cutting
and making seldom exceeds 5 s. an acre, even when the acre
produces above 200 stones.  Sometimes, though rarely, a se-
cond crop is made in the same year.

   Wheat takes the lead of all other grain here, the farmers
being induced to sow as great a quantity as possible, in order
that its lucrative returns may better enable them to pay the
high rents common in the parish.  It is sown in every situa-
tion, on every soil, and often with very little attention to the
state of the ground, by which, and by frequently repeating
this impoverishing article, the crops are by no means so good
as they were formerly.  Of this alteration the farmers are now
become sensible; and, though they still endeavour to have a
considerable portion of their lands in wheat, they are more
attentive to have the ground on which it is sown in good con-
dition.  Summer fallow, potatoes, beans and pease, and rag-
saugh, (i.e. two or three ploughings after a crop of hay) seem
