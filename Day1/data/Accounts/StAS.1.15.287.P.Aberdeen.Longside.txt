the thread-manufactures in Peterhead, a manufacture of
Woollen cloth at Nether-Kinmundy (the property of Francis
Garden of Troup, Esq;) has, of late, become very consider-
able for an infant manufacture.  It is conducted by Messrs
Thomas & Robert Kilgour, and deserves to be particularly
mentioned.
   About 40 families are employed by them constantly; to
whom they give houses and gardens.  But far the greater
number whom they employ, are scattered in this and the
neighbouring parishes, and work for the company only occa-
sionally.  The articles manufactured here are narrow cloths,
from 2 s. 3 d. to 5 s. per yard; and jemmys from 1 s. 1 d. to 1 s.
6 d. per yard.  They are used mostly at home.  For the
higher priced sort of narrow cloths, the demand is daily in-
creasing.  Men, thus employed, earn from 4 s. to 10 s. a-week
and women from 1 s. 6 d. to 3 d.  And in this manner about
2000 L. Sterling is disbursed annually.  It is with pleasure
the writer of the present article adds, from his own observa-
tion, as well as from the express testimony of their employ-
ers, that both men and women are peaceable, sobers and at-
tentive.  As a proof of this, it deserves to be mentioned,
that during the space of 15 years, not a single person has
been dismissed.  Living in a healthy county, and not crowd-
ed together, as in towns; and having, moreovers all gardens
for the employment of their spare hours, they, in general, en-
joy good health, and have numerous families.  Of late, the
labour of carding, teasing, etc. has been much facilitated by
the introduction of machinery moved by water.  The raw
materials are brought from the N. of England, and not un-
frequently from the London market.
