     Statistical Account

   Oats, potatoes, flax, barley, peas, and turnips, are raised
in this parish.  The grain most generally attended to, is
oats; the average produce of which may be from 4 1/2 to 5
bolls an acre.  When the ground happens to be laid down
with grass seeds, the prevailing crop is rye grass.  Of this,
there are two kinds, an annual and a perennial.  The former
gives a double quantity of grass the first year, which is
thought in most cases, to compensate the continuance of the
other.  A considerable quantity of rye grass seed is preserved;
and besides what is sufficient for next year's sowing, there are
frequently in good years, from 300 to 400 bolls sold out of
the parish.
   There are considerably more horses reared than supply the
wants of agriculture; and the rent is most commonly paid
from the sale of cattle.  The high grounds in the south and
west parts of the parish, are divided into 15 sheep farms;
and it is conjectured, that the whole lands employed in this
manner, may maintain about 6000 sheep.
   The ploughing is now most frequently carried on by two
horses, and Small's plough has been introduced; while, at the
same time, a great many of the old farmers regret the desue-
tude of the old Scots plough, and a greater number of horses;
and affirm that their soil requires a deep and large furrow.
It is scarcely possible to make any conjecture, with respect
to the rent of arable ground; because the greater number of
farms have some outfield or moss, or moor, connected with
them.  Were it otherwise, perhaps the ordinary rate of ara-
ble ground would be from 12 s. to 20 s. an acre.  The size of
farms is scarcely in any instance greater than what is neces-
sary to support a family; and almost every attempt to accu-
mulate this kind of property in this parish, has brought ruin
on the projector.
