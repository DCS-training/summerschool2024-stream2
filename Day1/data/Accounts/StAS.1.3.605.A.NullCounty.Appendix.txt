tradition, we learn, that there was a peculiar intimacy be-
tween this young lady and Mary Gray, of the house of Led-
nock, a small estate upon the banks of the river Amon, about
a mile distant from Kinved; distinguished beauties, but of
quite different complexions.  In the beginning of that dread-
ful plague, which so cruelly ravaged and depopulated this
country, they retired together to a lonely place, called the
Burn Brea, to secure themselves from the infection.  A young
gentleman, whose name and descent are not known, but
who is supposed to have been a native of the parish of Mo-
nedie, had a warm and laudable affection for them both, and
paid them a visit in their retreat.  This visit was attended
with fatal consequences; for, having unhappily imbibed the
feeds of the plague, without perceiving it, the young ladies
caught the infection, and died.  They were both buried in
one grave, which is still pointed out at the head of a heugh,
on the banks of the Amon.  The foundation of their bower
is also shewn on "yon Burn brae."  The late proprietor,
Major Barry, inclosed their burial place with a wall of mason
work, with this inscription on one of the stones in the wall,
"BESSY BELL AND MARY GRAY."

     NEW PARISH.

   Situation, Extent, and Population.-LOGIE-AMON, or the
New Parish, disjoined from the parishes of Foulis and Mon-
zie, and annexed, quoad Sacra, to the parish of Monedie,
lies contiguous to it on the west side, and reaches westward
to a small rivulet, called the Mill-Burn.  The river Amon
washes it on the south, from whence it extends northward to
the foot of the Grampians.  It is about 3 computed miles
square, and has a gradual descent from the north to Amon,
and contains, at present, between 700 or 800 souls.
