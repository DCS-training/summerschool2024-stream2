to the occasional neglect of parents in registering them; the above-
mentioned number, therefore, may be reckoned a little below the
truth. A register of deaths seems never to have been kept in this
parish, and the number mentioned has been supplied by the sex-
ton.
   The average number of persons below the specified ages are, as
nearly as can be ascertained, the following:

   The Average number of families in the parish is 195, of which
there are 38 resident in the small villages of Blackstoun and Ross-
land, and 157 in the country districts, living at considerable dis-
tances from one another.

   The excess of families above the number of houses is easily ac-
counted for, from the circumstance, that one house often accom-
modates two, and even three families.
   Character of the People, Customs and Habits, &c.- There is no-
thing remarkable in the character of the people, except it may be
the preservation of their simple, kindly, and respectful manners,
notwithstanding their proximity to the large manufacturing towns
of Paisley and Johnstone. They are very regular in their atten-
dance on divine ordinances, and are, for the most part, steady and
sober.

   There are only a few acres of natural copse-wood, which, though
picturesque in appearance, is of little value. Great attention is
paid by all the proprietors to the management of their woods, both
in the way of pruning and thinning them.
   There is not much land still in a waste and unproductive state,
if we except about 200 acres of moss land, which the proprietors,
