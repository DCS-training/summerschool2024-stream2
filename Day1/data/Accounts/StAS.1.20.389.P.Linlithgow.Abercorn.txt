very considerable extent.-Near the centre of this wood, a
coarse grey stone, apparently standing on end, is said to
mark the place where meetings were held in ancient times,
and has probably been the witness of many transactions of
which there is now no memorial in the world.
   The beauty of these plantations is generally rendered ac-

those causes by which they are most commonly injured.
These are, the planting trees, in thick hedge-rows, in the
line with the thorns; and the allowing the thorns to grow up
into trees, which, however beautiful they may be in this
