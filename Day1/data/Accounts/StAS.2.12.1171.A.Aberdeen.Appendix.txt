1700, by which the teaching of the Greek language was allotted
to one professor; but this improvement was not carried into effect
in Marischal College till session 1717-18.
   A visitation, by royal authority, of the University of Glasgow
in 1727, leaving ordered that each professor should be limited to
teaching one particular department, this led the way to an at-
tempt by the Principal and Professors of Marischal College to ex-
tend the same benefit to their own seminary in 1733; but, from
the opposition of one of their number to the measure, it proved
unsuccessful.  Twenty years afterwards the same plan succeeded,
chiefly from the ability of Dr Alexander Gerard, who drew up a
"Plan of Education, with the Reasons of it," which was adopted by
his colleagues, and, with a few alterations, has been followed since.
   This publication is remarkable, not only for assigning reasons
for confining the professors of the curriculum of arts to particu-
lar departments, but for a greater cbange,-tbe alteration of the
order in which the different branches of knowledge had hitherto
been taught in universities, both in this and in other countries.
The following extract from a college minute, dated 11th January
1753, exhibits the substance of the reasons which were brought
forward to justify this change.
   " The Principal and Masters of the Marischal College of Aber-
deen being, after the maturest consideration, all fully persuaded
that the present order in teaching Philosophy, introduced by the
Scholastics, is, since the reformation of Philosophy very improper,
-as by it the students are all at once engaged in the most diffi-
cult sciences, such as are most abstract from sense,-as they must
be taught the theory and foundations of evidence and reasoning
before they are acquainted with the sciences in which examples
of the various kinds can be found, so that it is impossible to ex-
plain or illustrate these different kinds to them,-and as the diffi-
culty of bringing them to conceive these abstruse subjects, before
they have been gradually prepared by the easier parts of study;
takes up so great a part of the time allowed for academical edu-
cation, as to leave none for some very useful parts of knowledge;
being also of opinion, that the gradual openings of the human
mind, as well as the natural order of things, render it proper,to
begin with, particular facts, which are subject to sense, or easily
conceived; from these to proceed to general reasonings on ob-
jects which are most familiar, material things; and, last of all, to
come to the abstruser inquiries concerning tbe operations, nature,
and states of the mind, the Deity, and Moral Philosophy founded
