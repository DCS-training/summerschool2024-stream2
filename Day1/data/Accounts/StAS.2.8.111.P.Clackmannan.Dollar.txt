capable of managing their own affairs to the best advantage. The
morality of the people is upon the whole praiseworthy, though
the minutes of the kirk-session record too many aberrations, on
the part of young people, from the rules of strict morality; and the
scenes that sometimes occur at fairs, and other merry-makings,
give much annoyance to the more orderly and well-behaved portion
of the community. Their religious character, compared with other
parishes, is quite unexceptionable.

    There are about twenty acres of moss in easter Dollarbeg, which,
by draining and burning, &c. might be brought into a state of cul-
tivation; there are also about forty acres of waste land in Shear-
dale moor, which, by a similar process, might be converted into
arable land: great improvements have with this view been car-
rying on in that district, for two years past, by an active and spirit-
ed tenant. There are also about fourteen acres in the lower grounds
of wester Sheardale, which are, at present, in a marshy state, and
covered with brushwood; but we fear nothing can be done to im-
prove it, as the ground lies low, and draining is rendered imprac-
ticable by the Devon at every flood, closing the drains and for-
cing back the water.
