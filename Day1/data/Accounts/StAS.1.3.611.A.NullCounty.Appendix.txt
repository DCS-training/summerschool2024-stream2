     GLAMMISS, p.124

   School.-There is a very flourishing school in Glammiss.
The present schoolmaster is eminent in his prosession.  His
salary and perquities amount to about 50 L.  Sterling, with a
good house, which, besides his own family, accomodates
some boarders.  The numbers of his scholars is about 50, at
an average.

   Cattle.-There are about 1190 cattle in the parish; 272
horses, and between 700 and 800 sheep.

   Miscellaneous Observations.- There is one good inn in the
village of Glammiss, and 3 alehouses; besides two or three
more of the last description, in different parts of the parish.
The number of these alehouses is much reduced of late,
which is not to be regretted, as they have always been found
to have a very bad effect on the morals of the people.- A
few farmers in the parish still employ cottagers in agricul-
ture; but the generality find, that they get their work best
done by hired servants.  The tennants are bound to no fer-
vices, except driving some coals, if required, and furnishing
a proportion of carriages towards the buildings of their mas
ter's houses.  They also furnish carriages for the building
or repairing of the church and manse.  The services for-
merly required of the tennants, made them little better than
slaves.-The nearest post town is Kirriemuir, which is about
4 miles distant.
