   Soil and Surface.-In so large a parish, the surface, As may
naturally be supposed, is made up of flat and rising grounds,
of hills and valleys; so that the soil in one place, must needs
differ widely from that in another.  In the S. W. part of the
parish, there are many thousand acres, at present thought un-
fit for cultivation, being completely covered over with heath,
or with deep moss.  For many miles, the haughs on the Earn, n,
and also on the Water of Allan, are, for the most part, a light
loam, on a gravelly or sandy bottom, which, with lime or
marle, produces excellent crops.  The higher grounds lie upon
beds of till, naturally wet, but, when drained, they are, by
the above mentioned manures, rendered no less productive.

been discovered in both sides of the parish, and much lime has
been used in agriculture.  Almost every farmer lays down a
field annually with grass feeds, and finds his account in it.
Less ground is now plowed up, more cattle and horses
are reared, and four times the quantity of grain is pro-
duced.  The tenants are therefore in a thriving condition,
and the peasantry, in general, are industrious, sober, and con-
tented in their stations.-Not only has much arable land been
meliorated, but what is still more worthy of notice, between
1000 and 1200 acres (in their former state good for little),
have, within these last 30 years, been inclosed and planted
with trees of various kinds, that now serve to adorn, and, ere
long, will enrich the country; by affording useful timber,
besides fuel, at an easy rate, to thousands, who derive but
little advantage from their mosses, and live at a great distance
from coal pits.

   Climate and Diseases.-As the parish abounds in wood, and
wood and water, the air is in general moist, and many situa-
