	of 16 and 60, in the year of the last Rebellion 1745, when nearly
	3000 men were enrolled as militiamen, on the estate of Suther-
	land.  At this last period, the relative proportion also of men from
	each of the townships, does not much differ from the allocation in

	   The Government returns give the following result for this pa-
	rish:

		          In 1801, the population was   1374
                             1811,	                1330
	                     1821,	                2008
          	             1831,	                2234

	   This increase is to be attributed to the successful establishment
	of the herring-fishery at Helmsdale, and to the settlement of se-
	veral small tenants in that track of improvable land, chiefly near
	the coast, from Port Gower to Navidale.  These causes of the
	increase have been in very active operation since the date of the
	last Government census, and, without attempting to anticipate, in
	exact numbers, the probable increase since that period, by trust-
	ing to any less authentic data than the census to be taken in the
	present year, it is believed by the reporter, that the increase will
	at least equal that which has occurred during the last two decades,
	or between the years 1811 and 1831.
	   The erection of houses in Helmsdale, which, with the excep-
	tion of Port Gower, is the only village in the parish, is not only
	annually on the increase: but the accommodation they afford, and
	the style of building, are improving.  This town, begun in  1818, has
	been regularly and steadily increasing since then; and the houses be-
	ing all new, and substantially built, and all roofed with slates or tiles,
	and the streets regular, the general appearance of the whole place
	is as pleasing to a stranger as the prosperity of its principal trade,
	and the internal comforts of its dwellings, have been important
	and creditable to the inhabitants.
	   There is no marked peculiarity in the habits of the people of the
	parish, or in their style or manner of dress.  They are generally
	frugal in their mode of living, but have a laudable anxiety to ap-
