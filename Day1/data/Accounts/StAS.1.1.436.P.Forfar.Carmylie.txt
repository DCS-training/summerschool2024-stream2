     Statistical Account

ground, when compared with the conterminous parishes.
The land is wet and spungy, and was thought, some years
ago, to be better adapted for pasture than for grain.  About
20 years ago, there were many farms in the parish occupied
by farmers in the neighbourhood, who used them for gra-
zing their cattle in the summer; but, ever since that time,
the proprietors have obliged the tenants to reside on them;
who, by driving lime and marl to their respective farms, and
by draining their lands by funk fences, etc.  have greatly me-
liorated the ground, and for several years have raised heavy
crops; which, though they were not equal in quality, yet, in
quantity, were not inferior to those produced on the grounds
in the neighbourhood, that have been long in a proper state
of cultivation.  On a very moderate computation, there is
four times the quantity of grain, especially of barley, raised
in this parish than there was 20 years ago.

   Rent.-The land rent is supposed to be about L. 1000
Sterling.  It has risen about a third within these last 20 years.
There are only 3 heritors in the parish, none of whom reside
in it.

     Church and Stipend, etc.-The walls of the church were
repaired about 40 years ago, and a new roof was thrown over
it last summer.  It is decently fitted up within for the ac-
commodation of the congregation, who are a sober and in-
dustrious people, and regular in their attendance on divine
ordinances.  The stipend amounts to about 400 merks Scots
in money, and a little more than 5 chalders of victual.  The
manse was built about 18 years ago.  There are very good
funds for the poor; and they are liberally provided for with-
out any assessment on the heritors.
