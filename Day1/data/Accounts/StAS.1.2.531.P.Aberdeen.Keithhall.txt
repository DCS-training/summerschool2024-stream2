who get occasional supplies.  In 1782 there were about 50
families, or 220 persons of all ages, who received assistance
either from the poors funds, or from the bounty of parliament.  In
the eastern division of the parish, then inhabited by about 500 per-
sons, there was not grain to preserve 100 alive.  Above 2 chal-
ders of meal were received in a donation from the public, and 3
chalders were sold for only 10 s per boll, (or 20 s per sack).

All the money the session had, was distributed among the poor;
and L. 10 were borrowed on a small property belonging to
them in the borough of Inverury.  Some of the parishioners
put money into the minister's hands, free of interest for 18
months, to purchase grain; and the farmers, who had no mo-
ney, sent, in their turn, horses and carts gratis, to Aberdeen,
for pease, bear, oats, and coarse flour.  The price of grain
was kept low here, compared with many other parishes;-
and, in this district, no forestallers made any profit.  The
debt then contracted by the parish, was only paid off in 1790.
At present the poor get annually about L. 18; of which L. 10
is the amount of the ordinary collections; from L. 5 to L .7, is
received at the administration of the sacrament; and L. 2: 5
of land rent from property in Inverury, besides what is
drawn for the use of the mort-cloths, and for penalties.

   Black-Cattle, Horses, and Sheep.-The number of black cat-
tle at Whitsunday 1790, in this district, was 1038:  their value,
as nearly as could be computed at that time, was L. 3733.
The number of horses was 204:  their probable value L. 1400;
The number of sheep 1844:  their probable value, L. 483.
The aggregate value of all, L. 5616.  This is about 5 years free
rent, or 4 1/2 years gross rent of this district; or nearly one fifth
part of the value of the landed property of the parishes of Keith-
Hall and Kinkell.  But though their price is high at present, their
number and intrinsic value has of late much decreased.  Above
