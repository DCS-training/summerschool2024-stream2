     Of Girvan.

The surge never rises here to any very great height; and so
happily is the harbour situated, that vessels can get out to sea
with a wind from almost any quarter, if it does not blow very
hard.  With such advantages, any kind of trade, and especially
the coal-trade, might, with good prospect of success, be carried
on.  Hitherto, however, little or nothing has been done in
this way.  There is at present, no more than one vessel above
20 tons burden, belonging to this place, or trading to it.  The
rest are all small, open, or half-decked boats, used for run-
ning salt from ireland, or freighting goods from one part of
the coast to another.  Nor, till very lately, was there any
thing deserving the name of manufacture to be found in Gir-
van.  The weaving of cotton-cloth has of late been intro-
duced by the manufacturers of Glasgow.  Upwards of 100
looms are now employed, and the business is extending every
day.  That a situation of advantageous for trade or manu-
factures should have been of long neglected, may appear sur-
prising; but may perhaps be in some degree accounted for by
observing, that Girvan is placed at a considerable distance
from any great trading or manufacturing town; that no per-
son bred to business, and at the same time possessing a good
capital, ever happened to settle here, or in the neighbour-
hood; and that habits of regular industry were probably pre-
vented or destroyed by the practice of smuggling, to which
the inhabitants were, for a long time, so much addicted.
There is reason, however, to hope, that is trade and manu-
factures continue to flourish in the country, in general, Gir-
van will, in a short time, acquire that share in them, to
which, from its natural advantages, it appears to be entitled.
