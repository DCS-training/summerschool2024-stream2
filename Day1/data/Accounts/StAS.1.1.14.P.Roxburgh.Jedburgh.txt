course to the legal method of obtaining the contributions of
absent proprietors.  These monthly assessments have varied
from two shillings to three shillings and six-pence per quarter,
on each hundred pounds of valued rent.  The assessment for

   The poor belonging to the borough of Jedburgh, are pro-
vided for by a plan in some respects similar to, but in
others materially different from, that above described.  The
magistrates hold quarterly meetings, in which they assess the
borough for the maintenance of their poor, and portion the
sums in the same manner as the heritors do; but the assess-
ment is not proportioned to the value of the property of in-
dividuals within the royalty; but according to as valuation of
the property of the burgesses and inhabitants, estimated by
sworn assessors appointed by the magistrates.  The assessors, 
in forming their calculation, and fixing the portion of assess-
ment to which each individual is liable, have respect not only
to oftensible property, but to the profits of trade, and other
supposed advantages.  It is obvious that such a vague and ar-
bitrary mode of calculation, is extremely liable to partiality
and error.

   The sums appropriated for the maintenance of each indi-
vidual vary, according to the circumstances of the claimant.
To single persons who can do no work, a shilling, one shil-
ling and six-pence, one shilling and eight-pence is allowed
weekly.  Six-pence, eight-pence, ten-pence to those who are
infirm and receive small wages.  Eight, ten, twelve, and
sometimes twenty shillings per quarter have been allowed for
