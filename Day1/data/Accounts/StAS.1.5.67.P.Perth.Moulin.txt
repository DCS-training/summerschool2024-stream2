serving that the weekly collections had long been very
small, intimated to their respective tenants, that if they
would make a decent contribution for the poor, they would
have their seats in the church free; that, otherwise, every
tenant would be charged with a small yearly seat rent, to be
applied to the use of the poor.  This intimation, accompanied
with some exhortations to charity, by the minister, which, for
the credit of his people, he is willing to suppose, had some
influence, increased the yearly collection from an average
of L. 6, 6 s. to L. 15, 12 s. in 1788, and L. 15, 2 s. in 1789.
From 1775 to 1784 inclusive, the heritors assessed them-
selves in 20 bolls of oat-meal annually, for the support of
the poor; but since the year 1784, this contribution has
been discontinued  as unnecessary.  In 1782 and 1783, the
people were much distressed from the scarcity of provisions,
particularly oat-meal, the price of which rose to 1 s. 3 d.
and 1 s. 4 d. the peck.  In 1783, the kirk-session and heri-
tors distributed 40 bolls of meal among the poor of the
parish.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The general size of the men
is 5 feet 5 or 6 inches; of the women 5 feet.  The tallest
man now living in the parish is 6 feet 4 inches; and the
oldest man now alive is about 95 years of age.  The people
have no idea of a seafaring life, and are very averse to
a military one.  They are humane, very obliging, well
enough contented; enjoy the necessaries of life in a toler-
able degree, and the comforts of society in abundance; are
frugal in their diet, but study a neat and showy apperance
in their dress and furniture.  None are known to have
emigrated beyond sea from the parish; there are no in-
stances, for many years past, of any person dying for
want; and but one has been banished.
