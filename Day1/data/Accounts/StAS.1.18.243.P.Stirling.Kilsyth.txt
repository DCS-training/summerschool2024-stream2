alder, the sycamore, and oak: but they are very thinly scat-
tered.
   The few fruit trees which we have are sometimes very
prolisic, but the produce is always precarious.  There is a
great variety and very considerable quantities of gooseberries,
rasps, and currans.  And few, if any country parishes can
boast of as many flower gardens, or a more curious and com-
plete collection of flowers.

   Animals.-The animals of this parish are such as are com-
mon over all the neighbourhood.
   Foxes, badgers, polecats, weasels, and hedgehogs, a-
bound.  A few otters and rabbits may be found also; and
the hare is frequently to be seen.
   The birds of prey, are in no respect singular or remarkable.
The most common are the kite, and the hawk, and the raven-
crow.  The owl is also to be found.  But the most destruc-
tive of all, is the grey glade, or kite, as it is commonly cal-
led.  The eagle once frequented our rocks and hills, while
pastured with sheep.  But since black cattle have come in
their place, the eagle is never seen.  Even the foxes and
ravens, on the same account, are not so numerous as here-
tofore.  The moor fowl and wild duck, the partridge and
wild pidgeon, the heron, the magpie and skylark, are
all to be found in their season.  The snipe, the spar-
row, the redbreast and wood-pecker, the bat, the com-
mon, on green moor, and red breasted or rose linnet, the black-
bird, the thrush, the goldfinch, the chaffinch, the wren,
etc. with all the varieties of small birds, are common
here.
   In winter, wild geese in amazing flocks, to the number of
200 or 300 at a time, appear in the valley.  The northcock
