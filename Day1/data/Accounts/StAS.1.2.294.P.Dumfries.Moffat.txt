     Statistical Account

   Roads.-The road from Carlyle to Glasgow, passes through
the parish, from south to north, for upwards of fix miles.-
The mail-coach between these places, passes and repasses eve-
ry day; and, at an average, about 70 cart load of merchant
goods, every week.  The trade mostly consists of cotton-yarn,
and cotton cloth.
   The road from Dumfries to Edinburgh joins the Glasgow
road at the village of Moffat, and parts with it four miles
north of that village, on the hill, known by the name of E-
rickstane-brae.  A little further north, the rivers Tweed, Clyde,
Evan, and Annan, take their rise: And though the Tweed
falls into the German ocean at Berwick, the Clyde into the
western sea below Glasgow, and the Evan and Annan united,
fall into Solway sirth, their sources are so near each other,
that one rivulet, which was formerly a branch of the Clyde,
now falls into the Evan.
   The trade on the Edinburgh road is not so considerable as
on the one which leads to Glasgow.  A mail-coach from
Dumfries to Edinburgh was lately set on foot, but has been
given up.  When that road is completely repaired, it will
probably be re-established.  Both roads are made by act of
parliament, and are maintained by the tolls.

   Woods and Plantations.-There is one natural wood in the
parish, about 50 acres in extent; consisting of oak, ash, birch,
alder, etc.  It is property of William Campbell, Efq.
writer to the signet, who hath inclosed it properly, and pays
every attention to its preservation.  It is upon the north side
of Moffat water, and adds greatly to the beauty of that part of
the country.  There was another natural wood opposite to it,
on the south side of Moffat water, belonging to his Grace the
Duke of Queensberry; but it was lately cut down, and, being
