8971 L. 9 s.; those of this last year, ending 5th July 1791,
to 13,296 L. 8 s. 4 d.; from which it is evident, that the
trade has increased rapidly.  From these duties a calculation
may be made of the value of the goods manufactured.  By
a statement laid before the House of Commons, a few years
ago, the duties upon printed linens and muslins were suppos-
ed to be equal to 10 per cent. of the whole value.  There
can be no calculation made of the value of the goods bleach-
ed on the banks of the river.

   The first printfield on the Leven was begun about the year
1768; the other two were erected a few years ago.  At first,
the printing b finess was almost wholly confined to handker-
chiefs, and in these no great variety of colours was attempted;
it was all done by what is called block printing.  They after-
wards erected copperplate presses.  These presses were at first
driven by the hand; but as they required great force, the man
who drove the press was obliged to rest frequently:  This kept
the other 2 idle, for there were 3 men employed about every
press.  To remedy this, they have constructed some presses to
be driven by water, one of which, driven by 2 men, can print
from 20 to 30 dozen of handkerchiefs in one hour.  These
presses, at first, were almost wholly employed in printing
handkerchiefs; but of late they have improved them, so as
to print two or more colours upon their finest linens and
muslins, leaving the sprigs and flowers to be put on after-
wards by the block printers.  At the printfields upon the
Leven, they have contrived, of late, to do a great deal of
work by machinery driven by water, which formerly was
done by the hand, and at great expence.  Their calicoes, for
variety and fineness of colour, are reckoned the first in Bri-
tain; the neighbourhood of London itself can scarcely be ex-
cepted.
