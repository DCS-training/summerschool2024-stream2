continual ravages.  Towards their being tenanted, not
only the prisoners of war, who were kept for mutual
exchange, or until they gave pledges for their ransom, 
but the many marauders and banditti, in time of peace,
when taken, also much contributed.  Although hang-

there were parties of them protected by some chiefs of
the hords in the recesses of Cheviot Hills, whom it was

to it.  This description of our old parochial bastile, leads 
to a remark, which, I know not whether it has been
