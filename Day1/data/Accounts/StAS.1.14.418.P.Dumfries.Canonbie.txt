And it did not escape his Grace's observation, that this
part of his estate was also capable of great improvement;
possessing the advantages of surface, and climate, and coal,
and lime.  A gentleman of distinguished talents and acti-
vity was at length found to direct and superintend im-
provements upon the estate in this country, Mr. Keir
above mentioned; whose chief attention came naturally
to be turned to Canoby, as the parish in the district most
capable of agricultural improvement.  In pursuance of this
view, roads were made; farms laid out where the plough
had never before entered; commodious houses and of-
fices built and slated at his Grace's expense, for the en-
couragement of the tenants; the ground divided into en-
closures with hedge and ditch; and leases given at a mo-
derate rate.  The consequence now is, that luxuriant crops
of corn are reaped, where heath, and bent, and moss,
had predominated, perhaps, since the deluge; population
increased; the spirit of industry roused; the face of the
parish beautified; and the inhabitants, in point of civiliza-
on, proportionably improved.
   Wheat is cultivated with success, on the land situated
on the banks of the river, as well as every other species of
grain; and the soil in this direction is well adapted for
turnips and potatoes, both which are raised in great per-
fection; although the turnip system is not so much fol-
lowed here as in some other places, less favourable, per
haps, for their production.  In the larger farms, the usual
routine of cropping is observed, viz. two crops of oats after
grass; then peace or turnips; then barley with clover and
rye grass.  Wheat is generally sown after potatoes; the
increase of which is seldom less than from 10 to 14 after
one; of oats, from 6 to 14; of barely, from 8 even to 
30; of potatoes, from 14 to 40, and upwards.
