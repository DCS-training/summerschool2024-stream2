  There are no chapels of Ease in the parish; but the Spittal
Square Church and Congregation, formerly belonging to the Old
Light Burgher Synod, and now united to the Established Church,
stands verv much in the same relation to the Establishment.  The
minister, the building, &c. are supported entirely by seat rents,
collections at the church doors, &c.  The ministers of the follow-
ing Seceding and Dissenting congregations in Stirling are support-
ed, and their places of worship kept up in the same way, viz. Unit -
ed Seeession, 2; Cameronian, 1; Independent, 1; Episcopalian,
1; Baptist, 3.  The Baptist congregations two of which are very
small, have no place of worship erected for them; but meet, one
in the Guildhall, one in the Tradeshall, the third in a bired apart-
ment.  There is also a Popish chapel, erected within these very
few years by contributions obtained in Scotland, England, and, it
is supposed, foreign parts.  How tbe priest is supported, I cannot
say; but believe, partly at least, by contributions from his congre-
gation.  This chapel is under the jurisdiction of the Bishop re-
siding in Edinburgh.  There has been no accurate enumeration,
that can be depended on, of the individuals, or families, belonging
to the different denominations since 1836, when returns were made
to the Royal Commissioners.  From the reports then given in by
the ministers of the Dissenting denominations, there were 2476
individuals, of all ages, or about 561 families, within the parish,
