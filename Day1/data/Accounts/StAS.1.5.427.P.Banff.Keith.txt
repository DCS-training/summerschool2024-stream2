where it fell, it so completely ruined the crop, that several
fields were plowed down, and those, that were spared, pro-
duced nothihg worth the expence of cutting.  The hail-
stones were fully the sice of pistol bullets, very irregular in
their shape, mostly angular, bearing the appearance of two
or three large hail stones joined; though the weather was
exceedingly fultry, and the ground very wet, they were not
compltely dissolved in three days.  In the year 1782, there
