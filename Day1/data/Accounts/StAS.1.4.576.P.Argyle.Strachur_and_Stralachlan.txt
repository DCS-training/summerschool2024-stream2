Highlander is extinguished in those that remain.  The
sheep have banished the men.  where, in 12 or 16 fami-
lies, a hardy race was reared, ever ready to repel an ene-
my, and gain glory to their country, an opulent tacksman,
with a shepherd or two, occupy the lands.  Their cover-
sation is not of former times.  New plans of tending their
sheep, and improving their wool, occupy their thoughts,
and engage their attention.  in short, the character of the
Highlanders will soon be forgot.  To know what it was,
recourse must be had to Sir John Dalrymple's Memoroirs, at
his entering on the transactions of Lord Dundee; or the
Sketch drawn of it by the Abbe Raynal, in Speaking of
the settlers in North Carolina.  And who can read these,
without regretting that he has no oppurtunity, in his own
country, of seeing the originals?  The Highlanders of old
did not live either in plenty or in elegance, yet they were
happy.  They piqued themeselves on their capacity of en-
during hunger and fatique.  They were passionately fond of
misic and of poetry.  The song and the dance soon made
them forget their toils.  The sound of the bagpipe is now
seldom heard.  With the modes of life that nourshed it,
the vein for poetry has also disappeared.  The deer have
fled from the mountains.  A forest, in the close neighbour-
hood of this parish, where several hundreds of them roam-
ed at pleasure, is now converted into a sheep-walk.

   Villges.-A military spirit prevails much among the
gentlemen of this country; they would wish to keep the
men; but their lands give so much more rent by stocking
them with sheep, that they cannot withstand the gain.
The numbers who emigrate yearly to the south of Scot-
land, and to foreign countries, is matter of serious regret to
every person interested in the Highlands.  To prevent this
evil, fishing vilalges are building on the north-west coast;
