answer the purposes of government equally well, were the
management of prices put into the hands of the pay-office,
and government become accountable for it, as well as their
wages; and, instead of obliging the seamen to employ a-
gents and attornies, at a great expence and risk, might not
the inspector of the pay-office correspond with the mi-
nisters of the different parishes to which the seamen belong,
(which he is even at present sometimes obliged to do), and the
situation and circumtances of each seaman's right and claim
being, in  the course of the correspondence, ascertained, pay-
ment might be had at the nearest bank, or an order given
upon the nearest customhouse, without either risk or expence?
By adopting some measure of this kind, the ministers of the 
parishes where there are sea-faring people would have much
less trouble than they frequently have by the present mode
of management, and would at the same time have the
satisfaction of seeing jutice done to a set of brave fel-
lows, who have risked their lives in the service of their
country.

   The people enjoy, in a considerable degree, the comforts
and advantages of society, and seem contented with their
situation and circumstances.

   The principal grievances under which the people labour, is
the partial and oppressive duty on coals, to which, from
their situation, they are  subjected.  Could this grievance be
removed, either by freeing them from it altogether, or by
laying a very trissing general duty on coals at the pit, it
would be a great relief to the people, and be a much more
produtive tax to government.
