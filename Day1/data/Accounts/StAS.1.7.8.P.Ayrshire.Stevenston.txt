   Sea-Bathing.-Saltcoats is the principal watering place in
Ayrshire.  From 300 to 500 people usually resort there,
during the Summer months, for sea-bathing, from the inland
country, especially from the towns of Paisley, Glasgow, and
Hamilton.

   Minerals.-There is a mineral well in the north quarter
of the parish, of the same kind with the chalybeate spring at
Moffat, but weaker; and, probably, several other springs

hearths, stairs, gates, etc.  It is also exported to London-
derry and Dublin, and fells there at 1 L. 12  s. per ton of
stone, which is 16 feet, i. e. 2 s. per cubical foot.-Beneath

which they fix their grates.  Fitted up in this manner, these
