tually seized upon one tenth of the crop yearly, upon the
lands of Longforgan, as part rent, and carried it, corn and
fodder, off the field; and not one dared to lead a sheaf of
corn till that was done.  Some time after, new tacks (leaves)
were entered into, more favourable to the tenant; but, in all,
still such a number of feudal services were required, as to
show the practice of former times, and how unwilling they
were to give them up; and, what is very extraordinary, it
was not the landlords alone who were unwilling to give
them up; for in the year 1782, when the present  proprie-
tor of Castle-Huntly proposed to convert all the feudal
bondages into a very moderate money-rent, some very in-
telligent tenants were averse to convert even the harvest-
bondage, which of all others was the most oppressive, al-
though at the moderate computation of 10 d. per day per
shearer.

   State in 1777.-In all leases delivered to the present
proprietor of Longforgan in 1777, there was very little dif-
ference from former customs; only, formerly, they were
bound to all services, and at all times.  In these tacks, the
number and kind of services were expressed.  They were
all thirled to a particular mill, i. e. they were bound to
grind all their coins at the baron's mill:  For the mill of
Millhill, to which Longforgan and all the estate of Castle-
Huntly were then thirled, although separated from that ba-
rony, originally belonged to it; and although the estate of
Millhill had been sold out of the family, by one of the
Earls of Strathmore, yet so little was the interest either of
proprietor or tenant attended to or understood, that he suf-
fered his tenants upon the estate of Catle-Huntly, (then
Lyon), to remain bound to grind their corns at the mill, no
longer his own.
