     of Monzie.

A considerable part of it is inclosed, but the greater part of
it still lies open.  The tenants are fully convinced of the
great advantage of inclosing, and would very willingly give
the proprietors interest for such sums as might be necessary
for that purpose.  However, as many of them have no leases
of their farms, such are discouraged even from that.  The
dread of being removed, where an avaricious neighbour of-
fers an augmentation, or an unfeeling matter accepts the
bribe of iniquity, binds up the hand of industry, and bars
the way of improvement.  As the arable ground is of very
different quality, so we find it let at very different rents.
As to the pendiclers, they rent their grounds at 10 s. to 25 s.
an acre.  Those who have large farms, rent the arable ground
at from 8 s. to 10 s an acre.  The hill part of the parish, is
let by the lump to those farmers who are nearest to it, and
they pay a separate rent for it; grass parks have been let in
this parish at 2 L. 2 s. per acre.  A great deal of services are
still performed by all of them to the proprietors, which
increase the value of the rents.  These services are chief-
ly farm work, with carriages of peats and coals.  In the
cess book, the valued rent of the parish is 2900 L. Scotch;
the real rent is nearly 1700 L. Sterling.  As there never was
any survey taken of this parish, the exact number of acres in
it cannot be ascertained.  None of the land is common.
Every proprietor knows exactly the marches of his own
estate.  The mosf of the hilly part is pasture, because of its
steepness, but the lower parts are cultivated and produce
very well.  There is but a very small part of the parish thir-
led to their lairds mills, they being exempted from that bon-
dage, and free to grind their corn where they please, upon
conditions of their paying to the proprietor a sum among
them, equal to the rent of the mill, and this in proportion to
their own rents.
