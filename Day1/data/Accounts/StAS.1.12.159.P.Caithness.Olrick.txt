stone weight of hay in autumn 1792, which he could have
sold on the field for 6 d. the stone weight.  In spring 1792,
he laid down under rye-grass and clover, 3 acres; under tur-
nip, 3/4 of an acre; under potatoes, 1 acre, and had 2 acres in
fallow.  From the advantages already reaped, he is determin-
ned to persevere in this mode of managing his farm; and o-
thers are preparing to follow his example.  Draining, ditch-
ing, and enclosing are carried on with spirit in this part of
the parish; this is entirely owing to the granting of such
leases as give the farmer the prospect of enjoying the fruits 
of his industry:  Besides, the proprietor acts in every respect 
more as the father than master of the people under him.  He 
farms himself to a large extent; and his returns are answer-
able to his attention and industry.  Another farm on his e-
state, occupied by Mr. Jolly, minister of Dunnet, is in a state 
equally flourishing and respectable with his own.  Mr Traill
has also made, and is now making very laudable exertions in
plantations, on a sheltered part of his estate, nor, as yet, has
he any reason to repent of his attention to this important ob-
ject.

   It is unnecessary to descend to much minuteness as to live
stock, when it can be asserted with truth, that the black cattle 
reared in the parish are not adequate to the culture of the soil.
As to horses, an import above what are reared, is necessary e-
very year.  The number of sheep, valuable neither for their 
wool nor flesh, may be from 1200 to 1500.  There is a great
number of swine reared, of a small size, but peculiarly deli-
cate, when well fattened; they are generally bought up by
butchers in the parish, and sold in the weekly market at Thur-
so.  The real rent of the parish is about 900 L. Sterling.
