labour in the open air.  A species of fever with nervous symp-
toms, but of no distinct or regular type, has some years been
frequent, particularly in the beginning of winter, and in spring.
Children have been more subject to it than adults.  Children are
frequently and fatally affected by the disease which is called the
croup.  Instances of consumptions now and then occur, chiefly
in young females.  The palsy, which not long ago was so rare,
as to have been vulgarly accounted a special visitation of God,
is now by no means uncommon.  Scrophulous taints are not

scruples, which long prevented the general use of this salutary
invention, are every day diminishing; the body of the peo-
ple yielding to the impression of that convincing attestation in
favour of it, which Divine Providence has given in its signal
success.

in the parish 47 persons who reached the age of 80, the full
half of which number were alive at one time; that in five
years preceding 1791, four instances occurred in which the
marriage relation had subsisted above half a century; and
that on an average of 14 years preceeding 1788, the annual
burials were but as 1 to 59 of the population.

in the country parish, 15 families, containing 66 souls; in
