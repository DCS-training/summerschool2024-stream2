       corn-fields rising higher and higher upon the acclivity of our hills
       also in the attention paid to the cropping of land, and the adop-
       tion of improved implements of husbandry. The order of crop-
       ping in general, is that of five divisions, viz. after lea, oats-next
       turnips and potatoes-next barley, with rye-grass and clover.,-and
       then grass for hay or cutting,-and afterwards the lea.
          Wheat is seldom sown in this quarter, because less profitable
       than barley.  Besides it is an uncertain crop, for by our long win-
       ters and continued frosts, there is a danger, some seasons, of its
       being altogether lost.  Much attention is now paid to the grow-
       ing of turnips, by manurhng with bone dust, &c., which crop is
       found to be very profitable.
          Distilleries.-Connected with the agriculture of this parish is
       the distillation of whisky, which is much to be applauded in every
       thing, except the object for which it is made.  The three distilleries
       here are advantageous in the consumption of the grain, and the feed-
       ing of cattle, and the manuring of the ground, as also in employing
       many workmen; but when we think of the 100, 000 gallons which
       they annually send forth, as of so little benefit to the human consti-
       tution, but rather very productive of much evil both to the soul
       and body,we would pause before we commend them; and say that
       we hope for better days-days when the public purse will -not be
       filled by "Scotland's scaith."
         Produce.-The following table will show the gross amount and
       value of raw produce raised yearly, on an average price for the

                                V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
          In this part of our statistics, the statements will be better un-
       derstood, by noticing Muthill and Ardoch separately, for the lat-
       ter is now a parish of itself quoad sacra.
          Market-Towns, &c.--The village of Muthill once had its mar-
       kets, but all these have been properly given up, owing to its near-
       ness to Crieff. - The public road to the south passes through the
       village.  At present, its population is about 1210, chiefly consist-
       ing of the labouring classes, and those connected with them.
