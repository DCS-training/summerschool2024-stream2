     PARISH OF GAIRLOCH.

     (County of Ross.)

     Name, Extent, etc,

   THIS parish had its name originally from a very small
loch, near the church and the house of Flowerdale,
and so close by the shore, that the sea at high tides covers it.

Gaelic language a short contracted loch.

   The parish of Gairloch is situated in the county of Ross,
in the presbytery of Lochcarron, and synod of Glenelg.  Its
length is no less than 32 miles English, and its breadth
about eighteen.

Highlands of Scotland.  The vallies are surrounded with
hills, that afford good pasture to different kinds of cattle.
As the parish abounds in hills and moffy ground, the arable
parts of it are consequently but of a small extent.  When
the season is favourable, the crops are by no means bad,
yet they scarcely serve the inhabitants above seven or eight
months.  The potatoes the farmers plant, and the fish they
catch, contribute much to their support.  This country,
