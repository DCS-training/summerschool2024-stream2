   dulge, except at marriage feasts, baptisms, Christmas, and new year.
   They are on the whole, however, contented with their situation :
   and considering their limited means of information, they are sur-
   prisingly intelligent and well informed, naturally.inquisitive and
   shrewd in their remarks, and always ready to communicate what
   they know in exchange for the information they receive. They
   are sober and industrious in their liabits, just and honest in their
   dealings, and, with a few exceptions, correct and regular in their
   moral conduct.  Their attainments in religious knowledge are not
   high; but the measure of knowledge to which thev have attained is
   solid and rational, tending more to influence their conduct than to
   puff them up with self-conceit.  They are not readily -carried about
   by every wind of doctrine, nor captivated by the noisy declamation of
   vagrant preachers.
      There have been three illegitimate births in the parish during
   the last three years.

   paid hitherto, to the improvement of sheep or black cattle, and
   still less attention has been paid by the common or small tenants
   to the cultivation of the soil,
