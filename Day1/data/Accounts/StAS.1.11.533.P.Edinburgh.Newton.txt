   Proprietors.-There are 4 heritors in the parish; the Duke
of Buccleugh, the Earl of Wemyss, Mr. Wauchope of Ed-
monstone, and his eldest son.

   Ecclesiatical State.-Mr. Wauchope is patron of the pa-
rish.  The stipend, which consists of money and grain, in-
cluding 100 merks Scotch, as the interest of mortified money,
and the allowance for communion elements, may be reckoned,
at an average about 106 L. per annum.  The glebe consists of
7 acres, 1 rood, and 31 falls of good arable land, lying very
conveniently round the manse, and all lately, inclosed with a
hedge, by the present incumbent.  The church was built in
the year 1742, and is situated very nearly in the centre, no
part of which can be said to be more than a mile and a half
distant from it.  The manse was built in the year 1749, and
stands within less than half a mile of the church, towards'
the E.

   School.-The schoolmaster's salary is 100 L. Scotch, The
number of scholars, at an average of 10 years, amounts to 48;
and the whole of his income, including the salary, school dues,
and the emoluments of the session clerk's office, may be reck-
oned, at an average of that period, no more than 24 L. per
annum.

<FOOTNOTE>

*No regular register of funerals has been kept for some time past.  They
can only be collected from the treasurer's accounts, who charges himself with
the dues of the mortcloths, which he has received.  This account must have been
for some time past very deficient, owing to a circumstance, which will be ex-
plained afterwards, as the explanation may be useful to other parishes.
