ter of marriages has been neglected; and from that period also,
many parents, connected with the Secession church, have omitted
the registration of the names of their children. No proper regis-
ter of deaths is kept in the parish.
    Antiquities.--The names and situation of several places in the
parish plainly show, that, in former times, they had been places of
strength. Thus there is the Castle of Arnfinlay; and also the tower
of Garden, no vestiges of which, however, now remain. And there
are several small heights in the parish to which the name Keir is
applied, which bear the marks of some ancient military works, such
as Keir-hill of Glentirran; Keir-hill of Dasher; Keir-brae of
Drum; Keir-knowe of Arnmore; and Keir-brae of Garden. Va-
rious opinions have been entertained concerning the origin and use
of these works; but no satisfactory account can be given of theme

                     III.--POPULATION.

The population of this parish is nearly as great as it appears to
have been at any former period; for although, by the enlargement
of the farms, the number of people, in the country part of the pa-
risb, is diminished, the population of the villages has increased.
The encouragment, for some time, given to weaving, and the de-
mand still for labourers, in the neighbourhood, have served con.
siderably to increase the number of inhabitants in the villages.
