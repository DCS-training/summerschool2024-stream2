     Statistical Account

   As the deficiency of artificial manures is one of the great-
est disadvantages under which this parish labours, great
pains should be taken to collect materials for making and
increasing them.  In no quarter of Scotland is due attention
paid to this; it is not therefore to be expected in the High-
lands.  A proper situation should be chosen for the dung-
hill, so as that the drainings may be collected into a reser-
voir, out of which they should be carefully, from time to
time, thrown upon it.  Putrid water from stagnant pools
and ditches, and the weeds growing in them, should be mix-
ed with peat-earth and lime, into a compost.  If whins,
heath, ragwort, thistles, docks, coarse grass, and all that mul-
titude of useless and injurious weeds which are seen by eve-
ry way-side, and along every hedge, are cut, and burnt in
close fires, it will be found that the ashes of them are va-
luable for the same purpose.  So is spent tanner's bark, de-
cayed vegetables, soap-ley, and many other articles which,
because each singly seems of a trifling moment, are neglect-
ed by the farmer, though the best effects would arise from
the mass of manure which the whole, when carefully mix-
ed, would form, in addition to what is customarily produced
on the farm.  Ex minimis maxima.

     HINTS FOR IMPROVEMENT ON LIVE-STOCK.

   The farms are in general overstocked with horses.  Many
of these might be disposed of, and oxen substituted, to the
number necessary, in their stead.  Oxen are fit for all the
operations of a Dowally farm, would be less expensive to
keep, and would not fall off in value during the years it
might be proper to work them.
