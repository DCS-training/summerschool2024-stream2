Methlick, Tarvis, Ellon, and Logie-Buchan, and at New-
burgh enters into the sea.

   Fish.-There is a valuable salmon fishing on this river at
Ellon, which yields of yearly rent about L. 80 Sterling.
The greatest part of the salmon are sent to Aberdeen for ex-
portation; and what is sold on the spot, has, for some years
past, fetched from 4 d. to 6 d. the pound, Dutch weight.
There are also plenty of excellent trout and eels in the river,
and a kind of shell fish, in which are found pearls, generally,
indeed, of small size; but frequently of considerable value.
This small river is navigable, from its mouth at Newburgh in
the parish of Foveran, by large boats, or what are called
lighters, at high tides, very near Ellon, and at ordinary
tides, within half a mile of it.

857 males, and 973 females.  In Dr Webster's report the
number is 2523.  There are in it under the age of 12 or 14
years, 400.-Under the age of 20 or 24,-460.-Of cbout 40
years of age, 520.-And above 40 years, about 450.  The
average of births in the parish, for the five last years, is 24
males, and 18 females.  The average of marriages, in the same
time, is 22.  The average of burials in the same time, is 16
males, 18 females.  There are no towns in the parish.  Ellon
is the only village, in which there at present reside, young
and old, 190 persons.  The number of farmers may be rec-

small.  Upon the largest farms are commonly employed,
four men servants, two women servants, and two and some-
