the kirk-session and principal tenants, who meet for that
purpose at the commencement of every quarter, and is
paid in advance.  The sum varies according to the circum-
stances of the poor.  Pensions are given from 5 s.  to 2 l.
5 s.  a quarter.  This mode of providing for the poor was
adopted by this, and the other parishes of the district, in
1773, with the laudable design of restraining vagrant beg-
gars, and consining them to their own parishes, where
their necessities must be best known.  By this scheme, it
was presumed, that such as were rendered unable, by age
or indisposition, to exercise their wonted industry, would
be taken care of, when they could no longer labour for
bread; while others, who had contracted habits of idle-
ness, would be prevented from living upon the public
stock, to which, by their industry, they were unwilling
to contribute; and having no resource for idleness, be
constrained to exertions of industry.  And yet it is a
question, whether those objects have been fully attained-
In this parish, where none that are able and willing to 
labour, can want employment; where the price of provi-
sions is reasonable, and fuel to be had at so easy a rate,
and where house rents are extremely moderate, it is sin-
gular that the number of poor should have increased in
proportion as the means  of industry have been enlarged
and diffused.  When the poor rates were established in
1773, the era of improvements in Canoby, the annual
amount was only 54 l.  2 s.  ; which left a surplus in the
collector's hands, after affording the necessary supply to 
24 individuals, the whole poor then in the parish.  At
Martinmas 1793, the number of poor on the roll was 68.
and the assessment for their maintenance a quarter 44 l.,
or 176 l.  a year; while, at the same time, there are two
friendly societies in the parish, who have considerable
