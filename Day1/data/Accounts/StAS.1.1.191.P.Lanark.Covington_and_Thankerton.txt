at 12 s.; the worst at 2 s. 6 d.  The average rent of farms is
L. 50.  The rent of the parish is L. 920 per annum.  If in-
closures are surrounded with wood, the farmers are convin-
ced of their great utility.  Harvest, in general, commences 
about the beginning of September.  The parish usually ex-
ports one-fourth of the produce.  In 1782, three-fourths of
the crop were destroyed by the frost.  In 1783, the crop was
remarkably good, feed being procured at a distance, and the
season being favourable.  The heritors gave a generous assis-
tance to their tenants.  Hence, the bad effects of the season
1782 were not so severely felt as was at first dreaded.  The
oat meal sold at L. 2:6:0 per load of 16 stone.  The far-
mers who were so fortunate as to have any of the for-
mer crop, got an additional price for it:  But this fell heavy
on the poor labourer; especially as he was often obliged to re-
main idle, the tenants being unable to employ him.

   Population.-Fifty years ago, the inhabitants were 600.  The
principal cause of the depopulation since that time has been
the enlarging of the farms.  The return to Dr Webster was
521.  In 1779, the number of inhabitants was 484.
