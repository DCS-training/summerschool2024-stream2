Farmer Society, which, it is hoped, will in time supersede
the necessity of making any provision for the poor.  E-
very member, at his admission, has the option either to
pay L. 1, 1 s. Sterling, and be exempted from any future
payment, or 6 s. at entry, and 1 s. yearly.  This money
is lent upon proper security; and when it amounts to

the country, sensible of its being founded upon good prin-
ciples, have joined them; and, it is hoped, it will soon be
put upon such a footing, as to afford an ample provision
for the poor, and preclude the necessity of poor's rates,
which have been much and justly complained of, as preju-

owing to a practice, that has become general for some
years past, of letting large tracts of ground, to one or two
individuals for sheep-grazing, which were formerly occu-
pied by 8 or 10 different tenants.  The landholders found
it their advantage to let their lands in this manner, as one
or two people, who had money to stock the land with
sheep, and understood how to manage them, could afford
to pay a  higher rent, than many of the former possessors,
who neither understood grazing nor tillage, and could 
hardly, by their poor unskilled efforts, gain a miserable
