     Statistical Account

tion, that the elevated grounds, dividing the upper and lower
quarter of the parish, were formerly clothed with wood;
now they bear only heath.  Previous to 1714, there were
some avenues to the castle of most stately beech, of which
hardly a vestige now remains.  The late Earl of Panmure,
about 20 years ago, made two plantations, chiefly of Scotch
fir; one of them about 4 miles in circumference, the other
of less extent, Both are thriving admirably, and promise
advantage to the proprietor, and much benefit to the country.
   Birds and animals are much the same as in other parts of
the country.  Birds of passage are, the cuckoo, swallows of
different species, sea-gulls occasionally, from a loch in the
neighbourhood.  Birds of song are, linnets, thrush, black-
bird, red-breast.  Wild animals are, fox, hare, otter, polecat,
weasel.  No deer are inhabitants of the parish, although a
severe storm sometimes occasions a visit from them.  There
is a considerable salmon fishing.  The fish are mostly dispo-
sed of by contract with merchants in Montrose concerned in
the London trade.  The sheep may amount to about 2000.
The horses and cattle are not distinguished by any remark-
able circumstance.  Till lately, the horses were in general
rather of middling strength, but the breed is gradually im-
proving.  It is believed that the parish supplies itself with
that article, but it does not much more.  The farmers here
have not hitherto attended much to search out the best breed
of either horses or cattle.  The better sort may average about
18 L.; the inferior much lower.  Best oxen, from 3 to 4
years old, about 6 L.  Best cows about 5 L.; inferior, 3 L.

   State of Agriculture.-Under this head, the circumstances
of the parish, compared with what they were 30 years ago,
offer a very pleasing subject of contemplation.  At that peri-
od, the greater part of it had been recently held of tacksmen
