open, the sheep they found detroyed their grass in the winter
time*.  Though the farmers labour with horses, they bring
up a good many cattle; some rear 8; others 10 ; and some
12 yearly.  They do not bring these to market, till they 
are 3, sometimes 4 years old; and then they will receive
for each L. 7 or L. 8 Sterling.  Some farmers sow a few
turnip, and seed some cattle; but this practice does not ge-
nerally prevail.

   Character of the People, etc.-They are a sober, regu-
lar, and industrious people, and mostly employed in farm-
ing, (the few tradesmen already mentioned excepted).  In
the parish there is neither brewer nor baker.  Within
these 30 years, their situation is greatly altered to the bet-
ter, and I can, with satety, say, that more money has
been acquired by farming in this parish, and the vicinity,
these 30 years past, than for 200 years before the period,
though, at the same time, their mode of living is greatly
improved, their houses more comfortable, and better fur-

*Though the number of servants are greatly diminished, their wages
are very much increased.  About 30 years ago, a principal man-servant
would have hired himself for a year, at the rate of L. 2 or L. 2, 10 s.
now they receive L. 10 for the same space of time.  Then a day-labourer
would have hired for 3 d. a-day, and his victuals; now they receive
1 s. and their diet, for the same space of time.  Then a reaper in har-
vest would have been hired for the harvest for 12 s.  Sterling: now they
will receive L 1.10 s. for the same space.
