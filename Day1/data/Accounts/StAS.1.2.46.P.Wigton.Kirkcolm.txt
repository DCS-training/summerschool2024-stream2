     NUMBER V.

     PARISH OF KIRKCOLM.

     (COUNTRY OF WICTON.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JAMES M'CULLOCH.

     Name, Situation, Extent, etc.

   THE name of this parish is derived from St. Columbus,
to whom the church was dedicated.-It is situated
in the country of Wigton, the presbytery of Stranraer, and
synod of Galloway.  It is a little peninsula of itself, detached
from every other parish, except Leswalt, which forms its
boundary to the south.  On all other sides, it is surrounded
by the sea.  It is, on an average, about four miles in breadth,
and it extends in length, along the west shore of Lochryan,
from five to six miles.  On this coast, partly formed by the
shores of Kirkcolm, is a beautiful bason, called the Wig,
large enough to afford a safe retreat for a great number of
small craft in bad weather; and in other parts of the bay of
Lochryan, there is a sufficient depth of water for ships of any
burden, and either good anchoring grounds, or a soft beach, as
may be mist cinvenient: And as there are no shoals or sunken
rocks near the mouth, to obstruct the entrance, it is questionable,
whether a more convenient harbour is to be found between
the two head-lands or Mulls of Kintyre and Galloway.
