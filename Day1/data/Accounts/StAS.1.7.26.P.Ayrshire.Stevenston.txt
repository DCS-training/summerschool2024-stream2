   The marriages comprehend those only where the couple con-
tinued to reside in the parish.  Those, where the bride left

this parish is chiefly to be ascribed to the influx of strangers
from other parishes into a place where they have a reason-
able prospect of work and maintenance; and the rate of this
will be best seen from the following facts.
