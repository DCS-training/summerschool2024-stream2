The far-famed barony of Ferrintosh, belonging to Culloden
forms the, central district of the parish. It contains, as appears
from a survey made in 1810, 4726 Scotch acres (5960 acres im-
perial) comprising:
		                 A.      R.      P.

	Arable,			1826	0	14
	Pasture,		1610	0	25
	Moor,			1051	2	13
	Houses and gardens,	  11	1	27
	Roads			  16	2       20
	Woods,			 210	3	37

	Total,			4726	3	14

The quantity of arable is now, however, greatly increased, as
hundreds of acres have been brought into cultivation since the sur-
vey referred to was taken ; and it may be added that much of the
reclaimed land is of a superior quality. Improvements on an ex-ten-
sive scale are rapidly advancing on this estate. The yearly rent
is about L. 2500 Sterling.
   Of the estate of Conan, comprising the western portion of the
parish, Sir Francis is proprietor. The exten t of this property
may be estimated at 2400 imperial acres, of which are arable 1500
acres; in pasture, including uaoor, 300 acres; and in woods 600 acres.
   It is due to the worthy Baronet to state, that he is distiguished
for zeal in, a ricultural improvements, as respects both the reclaim-
ing of waste ground, and introducing the modern system of hus-
bandry among his tenants. The annual rent is above L. 1000
Sterling.
   Parochial Begisters.-The oldest register now extant is dat-
ed in 1715. The writer of the former account of the parish
makes mention of one commencing in 1709; but if sue ever
existed it must have been lost, as the present incumbent never saw
it. For the first thirty or forty years the entries seem to have been
ade very irregularly, there being intervals of years, during which
neither baptism nor marriage was inserted; and in the case of bap-
tism, when recorded, the nam e of the father alone was registered.
Subsequently, however more attention was paid to this important
matter; and for a considerable number of years back. the registered.
have been kept with great care; baptisms and marriages being
unctually entered. Of deaths no record is kept,-a circum-
stance which requires reform.
