This is the part of the parish where it joins Cruden On the
declivity of a hill, which separates the two parishes, there
are still visible a great number of tumuli, or small cairns, in
which are found square apartments, formed by rough stones,
of from 18 inches to 2 feet, and containing ashes or red
earth.  At a small distance from these, and nearly on the
highest part of the hill, is a cairn of a much larger size, of
an elliptical form, and measuring in circumference about
400 feet at its base.  It is well known by the name of Cairns
Catto; and some traditionary legends connect its history with
similar cairns in the parish of Cruden, and in some of the
neighbouring parishes, along the Murray Frith, as well as
with the idea of a foreign invasion.  At the bottom of the
hill are some springs, known by the name of the Kemp, or
Camp-wells; and a little farther to the West, on the oppo-
site rising ground, is a field, which still bears the name of
the Battle-sauld.

   Language.-The Buchan dialect has been long famous for
the want of that neatness of articulation, and of that elegance
of found and accent, by which the Southern and more culti-
vated nations have characterised their respective languages.
In proportion as language becomes more resined, the uncouth
guttural is either entirely excluded, or very much softened.
In the English and French, and indeed in all the Southern
languages, it is not to be found in German, Dutch, and
Scotch, and the other northern dialects of Europe, it is con-
stantly recurring, and seems to point out their common ori-
gin, independent of etymology.  But where any attention has
been paid to the cultivation of there dialects, the guttural
and harsh sounds of the g and ch, have been almost entirely
done away, and either softened into the resemblance of j, or
hardened into that of k.  Any person will be sensible of this,
