   From a reference to the parish of Falkirk, in an action
with respect to the patronage of the church and parish of
Oldhamstocks, in the presbytery of Dunbar, which was
depending in the year 1748 between the King and Mr
Hay of Lawfield, it appears that the parishes of Denny,
Slamannan, Muiravonside, and Polmont, constituted for-
merly parts of the parsonage of Falkirk.  The three first
of these parishes must have been very early separated from
Falkirk; but it was not till the year 1724 that Polmont
was formed into a parish.  The minister of Polmont has
not only stipend from his own parish, but also from those
of Falkirk and Denny.
   The estate of Callander having been confiscated imme-
diately after the commotion in the year 1715, it was sold
about the year 1720; and such tithes as were not conveyed
with the estate, were disposed of by the commissioners and
trustees of the forfeited estates in Scotland to Mr Hamilton
of Dichmond, under this express stipulation, that they should
be subject to the stipend of a minister for the new parish,
which was to be taken off the parish of Falkirk.  This cir-
cumstance explains by what means it happened that stipend
is paid both out of this parish and Denny to the minister of
Polmont.
   Falkirk is situated on the north road between Edinburgh
and Glasgow, and it is nearly at an equal distance from
both.  The road to Stirling and the North Highlands also
passes through this town.  Falkirk was once denominated
Ecclesbrae, that is, the Church on the Brow; and the name
is truly descriptive of the situation, for the town stands on
an eminence, which has a declivity on every side.  In the
Gaelic language it is called an Eglais bhris, but more com-
monly an Eglais bhrec.  The former of these phrases sig-
nifies the Brocken-Church, which some think is not impro-
perly translated Falkirk, that is, the Fallen Church.  Cer-
