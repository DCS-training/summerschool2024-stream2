regulations.-Grounds upon the declivities of the hills, and in
flat moors to the extent of 500 acres, might be converted into
arable land of no bad quality.  A very public spirited gentle-
man, made out, 25 years ago, a good large farm on a moor
at the east end of the parish, which he accommodated with
substantial elegant farm houses, and out-offices, that promise
to turn to good account.  A gentleman in the bishopric is just
now improving a farm, acquired from the hill, of the extent of
80 acres, which is estimated to be rather of superior quality to
the land upon the level of the Tay.  It is probable that more
improvements of this kind are coming on apace.  From what
has been already stated, with respect to produce, it is manifest
that agriculture in this parish it not arrived at any advanced
stage of improvement.
   But an active and enterprizing spirit is now beginning to
discover itself among the farmers; which, if tenderly cherish-
ed and judiciously directed, cannot sail of producing import-
ant effects.  In riding through large districts of the parish, in
the beginning of spring, it affords one much pleasure to ob-
serve in almost every field the operations of a glowing and vi-
gorous industry; draining of bogs, tearing up of brush wood,
blowing of stones with powder, and the carrying them
off the fields.  Hence meadows that yielded from 30 to 40
stone per acre of miserable bog hay, and pieces of ground,
that produced nothing but rushes, briars, or other useless vege-
tables, are daily converted into the best arable land in the
country.  The people watch every opportunity that occurs of
carrying home some lime, and are beginning to make experi-
ments on their little farms, in the way of sown grasses and tur-
nips.  The youth learn all the new modes of husbandry, and
to be good plough men, at service in the low country.  The
