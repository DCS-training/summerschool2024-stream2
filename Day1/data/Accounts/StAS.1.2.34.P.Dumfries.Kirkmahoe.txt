     Statistical Account

is properly glebeindeed, not exceeding four acres; but the grass
and arable land united, may be from seven to eight acres.

   Heritors.-There are four heritors who have considerable
estates in the parish.  Of the rest, to the number of four-
teen, the greater part of them have only small properties;
and are commonly distinguished by the name of portioners.
They have of late got their lands, which has occationed very great
improvements.

   Rent.-The valuation of the parish is 7234 1/4 merks Scots.
The real rent cannot easily be ascertained.  It probably a-
mounts to about L. 3000. sterling.  As lands are rising,
and as there is a very great track of fine holm, and other
ground of an excellent quality, and still capable of much im-
provement, it is not easy to conjecture to what sum the rental
may soon rise.  Some land now lets at from L. 1:10s to L. 2
per acre.  Every sort of grain produces in the neigbourhood,
also potatoes, turnips, etc. are raised to very great perfec-
tion.

   Poor.-The poor, who, for 40 or 50 years back, have been
about 20 in number, have always been maintained by the
public collections in the church, together with some dues on
particular occasions, and the interest of some mortified mo-
ney.  In this way, by distributions four times annually, and
some small donations occationally given amongst them, there
have never been any complaints.  Some of the poor, too, are
pretty industrious, and endeavour, in a great measure, to main-
tain themselves; by which means, more can be given to others,
who are old or infirm, and unable to do any thing.
