27 acres; and the rent of the infield acre varies according
to the quality of the soil, etc. from 10 s. to 20 s.  The pa-
rish, besides supplying* itself, exports a quantity of victual
to Dunkeld and the Highlands.  The staple grain is oats
and barley, (about a boll of seed to the acre), each of
which yields, at a medium, 4-5 returns.  More green
crops would be raised were there more inclosures, of
which last, the great advantage is every day felt and ac-
knowledged.  The turnips are but lately introduced here,
and none of them are sown in the broad-cast.  The farm-
ers are not yet sufficiently apprized of the great propriety of
thinning them out in due season to proper distances in the
drills, by which neglect they are prevented from swelling
to their proper size.  Potatoes are becoming a favourite
crop, and they afford food to the people during a great part
of the winter.  In a few places yams+ begin to be raised,
of which both the horses and cows are remarkably fond.
The cows, when fed with yams, give better milk than
when they are fed on clover or turnips, and the yam-milk
has no foreign taste.  Summer-fallowing is little practised,
and, by consequence, the ground is in many places foul.  The
couch-grass extracts the substance from the manure, and chokes
the crop.  Were more of the grounds inclosed, that rotation
of crops, which now begins to be known and approved
of, would become more general; and till this be the case,
farming cannot be carried to any high degree of perfection.
The following rotation, which is well known in England,
and in many parts of the lowlands, has been lately tried
here, on a small scale, with very considerable success.  The
