   Eminent and Remarkable Men.-The Honourable John
Grant, late Chief Justice of Jamaica, was a native of this
parish.  At Knock of Kinchardine, in the other extremity
of the parish, was born in the 1700 John Stuart, common-
ly called, and well known by the name of the John Roy Stu-
art.  His mother was 55 years old when he was born.
The one of these gentlemen was as remarkable for certain
talents, as the other was eminent in the station which he so
lately filled.  John Roy Stuart, served for several years as
lieutenant and quarter-master in the Scots Grays, till the
year 1740, when he applied for a company in the
42 d Regiment, which being denied him, he left the king-
dom, went for some time to the continent, and afterward
to France, where he died in the year 1752, only a captain.
By these means his talents were lost to himself and to his
country.  He had education, without being educated; his
address and his figure, showed his talents to great advan-
tage.  He was a good poet in Gaelic and English.

   Roads and Bridges.-It was only about the year 1764,
when the present proprietor Sir James Grant entered to the
estate, that roads were begun in this part of his estate, called
Strathspey, which is about 30 miles in length.  Since which
period, he has made above 132 miles, when the whole is 
added together.  The roads in this parish, are remarkably 
good, and going on yearly, by means of the statute-la-
bour.  The great roads are made through these parishes
by Sir James Grant and the Duke of Gordon.  Cross
