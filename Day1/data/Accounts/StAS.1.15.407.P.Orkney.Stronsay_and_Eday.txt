to the principal tenant, by whose ploughs these small farms
should be laboured.
   8thly, That in all respects, except those above mentioned,
the stipulations be left to be mutually condescended on by
the principal tenants, and by their subtenants and cottars, or
boll-men, respectively.
   9thly, That heritors, who incline to encourage manufac-
tures, and increase the population of their country, may re-
serve in their own possession some small farm or parcel of
ground on their estates, best adapted to the purpose, to let in
very long leases, or to feu out to be houses and gardens for
shop-keepers, kelp-makers, mechanics, fishers, day-labourers,
etc.  Such families might thus furnish a ready market for
butcher meat or other provisions raised by the neighbouring
tenants, or their dependents.
   By adhering to these regulations, the heritors, or their heirs,
at the expiry of 57 years, would find their estates in a high
degree of cultivation; would have an additional rent well
paid; a certain proportion thereof, one third or thereby, in-
closed, and the best security afforded against loss by bank-
rupt tenants, which is found to be a great deduction from
the rental in many districts in Scotland, with an increased
price for such articles of rent as might be stipulated to be
paid to the heritors in kind.
   All these advantages, without any expence to the heritors,
would doubtless contribute, in a high degree, to the comfort
of the tenants and of their dependents; and also to advance
the interest of the community++.
