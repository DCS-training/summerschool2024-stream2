Ploughs, etc.; and about 37 carts, with hay tops for lead-
ing corn.  Where the ground is level, and the ridges straight,
these ploughs are managed by two horses only; and one man
both holds and drives, which occasions a considerable saving
of time and labour*.

   Population.-For these 30 years past, the population has
varied little; though, from the register of baptisms and buri-
als, there appears to be a great increase; the number of the
former, within that period, being 343, and that of the latter
only 145.  The number of inhabitants, at present, is 334,
all of whom attend the established Church, except two or
three Seceders.  Of these, there are 16 farmers, who keep
two ploughs each; 2 smaller ones, who have a horse and
some cows; 14 weavers and 2 wrights, who have a cow and
an acre of ground apiece; 2 taylors, 2 ale-sellers, and 1
smith.  There is also a small bleachfield, with a washing-
mill, beetles, etc. and a thread mill, which give work to 14
or 15 people.

*The average annual wages of a plowman, in both parishes,
are 8 L. though some have 10 L.; those of a maid-servant 3 L.
including bounties; such as 2 yards of linen and an apron, with
ground for 2 lippies of lintseed.  About 40 years ago, the
wages of the former were only 2 L. and of the latter 20 s. with
the bounties.  A day's wages of a man employed in agriculture
are 1 s. or 8 d. with his victuals; those of a wright 10 d. a ma-
son 1 s. and a taylor 8 d. with their maintenance.  These wages
are found sufficient for the support of themselves and families
while in health; and, when in distress, they are aided from the
funds.
