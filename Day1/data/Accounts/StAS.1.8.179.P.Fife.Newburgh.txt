     of Newburgh.

owing to the general increase of wealth, and other obvious
causes, are in some danger of requiring the authority of an
established and respectable magistracy, to preserve them in
tranquillity and good order.
   The town of Newburgh, consists of one street of consider-
able length, with small suburbs at each end, and a lane lead-
ing towards the shore from its centre.  The houses, on each
side of the lane, and in the suburbs, have been built within
there 30 years.  The town itself, does not occupy more ground
than it did in the end of last century; but, in consequence of
alterations, that have since been made upon the buildings, it
mutt be capable of containing double the number of inhabi-

low built, and covered with thatch of straw, or of reeds.
Of late years, a better style of architecture has prevailed; and,
at this day, Newburgh has some pretentious to neatness, in
the structure of its houses.  Sixty years ago, few of its houses
concealed their rafters.-At present, scarcely any of them,
and none lately erected, present that naked appearance.  On
the same spot, where 12 years ago a board was placed in the
window, to exclude the winter storm, may now be seen, a
Venetian blind, attached to the casement, for blunting the
rays of the summer sun.  Within there to years, not fewer
than 30 houses have been rebuilt, within the liberties of
Newburgh; some of which might be rented at 12 L. and none
for less than 5 L. per annum.  Preparations are also making,
for rebuilding two or three more.  The street of Newburgh,
which has long been paved with stones, having fallen into dis-
repair, the magistrates and town council, lately, formed the
resolution of paving it a new; and by means of assessments
from proprietors within the burgh, together with a small al-
lowance out of the statute labour, leviable upon the inhabi-
tants at large, they have made considerable progress in the ex-
