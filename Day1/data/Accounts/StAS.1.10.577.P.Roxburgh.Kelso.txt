   Soil, Agriculture, and Produce.-The soil of this parish,
for a considerable tract on both sides of the river Tweed,
and in that part of it which lies between the Tweed and
the Tiviot, is in general composed of a deep rich loam,
upon a bottom of gravel; from its favourable situation, and
the culture it receives, it produces early and luxuriant crops.
Towards the N. W. extremity of the parish, the soil is a
wet clay; in the S. it is in general thin and wet, and the
bottom is a red clay; here the crops are generally three
weeks later than in the vicinity of the rivers.  About 20
years ago, it was a common practice to divide the cultivated
land into six equal parts, each of which, in regular succession,
got a summer fallowing, and all the dung that the farm pro-
duced, lime being then seldom used in agriculture.  The
crop immediately after the fallow was always wheat, the se-
cond barley, the third oats, the fourth pease:, and the fifth
oats or wheat; after these crops it was often laid out into
pasture, sometimes fallowed again.  By this management the
lands were always soul, so that the crops, excepting the first,
and sometimes the second, were mostly poor.  But lime hav-
