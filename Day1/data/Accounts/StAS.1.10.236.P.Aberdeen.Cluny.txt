ainy, which in that quarter is the boundary of the parish.
There is now no wood on it, but probably there was some for-
merly.  The Dominium directum, as it is called, belongs to
the Duke of Gordon, but the dominium utile to his vassals all

   Rent, Soil, and Climate.-The valued rent of the parish is
2333 L. 6 s. 8 d.  Scotch, and the real rent from 1000 L. to
1100 L. Sterling.  The soil in general is warm and dry,
though not deep, except in the flat or low ground, and lies

rheumatism, consumption, nervous fever, and sometimes scro-
phula.  Of these, consumption is most fatal.  The small pox,
which used to carry off a fifth part of the human race, seems
now to be less acrimonious, and inoculation begins to be ge-
nerally practised.  The climate is salubrious; and, in dange-

make an annual and liberal contribution.

   Agriculture, Farmers, and Cattle.-There are 57 plough-

owns besides those belonging to proprietors.  The land is ge-
