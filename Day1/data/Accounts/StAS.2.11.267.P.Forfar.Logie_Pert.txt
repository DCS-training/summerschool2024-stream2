   It may here be added, that a very productive source of income
to many families is the dairy produce which is consumed in the pa-
rish, and weekly, or oftener, sent to Montrose, amounting, it is be-
lieved, to not less than several hundred pounds annually.
   Manufactures.--There are, as already mentioned, two great ma-
nufacturing establishments in the parish, namely, those at Logie
and Craigo. They are both situated on the banks nf the North
Esk, about half a mile distant from each other. The Logie works,
which comprise a bleachfield and flax spipning-mill, belong to a
company in Montrose. The bleachfield has been in existence
nearly seventy years. At present, it is employed solely in bleach-
ing linen yarns, which are afterwards manufactured into various
kinds of cloth for the home and foreign markets. The number
of hands employed varies from 40 to 50, consisting of men, women,
and boys, the boys earning from 4s. to 6s., the women from 5s. to
6s., and the men from 10s. to 12s. weekly. The average work-
ing time is eleven hours per day. The flax spinning-mill was
erected upwards of thirty years ago, and has been lately much
enlarged. It employs about 130 hands, consisting of men, women,
and children. None are employed under ten, and but few un-
der twelve years of age; the wages vary from 3s. to 20s. and up-
wards weekly, and the average working time, according to the late
act, is sixty-nine hours weekly, or twelve hours per day, for five
days of the week, and nine hours for the remaining working day.
The Craigo works are still more extensive, comprising a flax spin-
ning-mill of 31 frames, a bleachfield, cloth finishing machinery,
and an alkali manufacture, giving constant employment to about
150 people, male and female, and paying about L. 100 weekly in,
wages. These latter works, which attained to their present extent
