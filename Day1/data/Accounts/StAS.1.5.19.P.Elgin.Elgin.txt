   Miscellaneous Observations.-  In the year 1754, a ship
loaded with coals, came to Loffiemouth.  The demand was
then so small, that the importer could not dispose of 100
barrels.  Now, the demand is so great, that upwards of
twenty ships arrive with English coals, and six with Scotch,
and it is daily encreasing.  It is particularly unkind in go-
vernment, not to say oppressive, that those who are necessa-

should pay an exorbitant duty on that indispensible accom-

the agriculture and the manufactures of the country.

would operate greatly in their favour through life.  A pin-
work, or any such employment, that demands no great ca-
pital, and yet requires a number of seeble hands, would be
of the greatest consequence, and produce happy effects.

object, to have this speedily accomplished.
   The history of a plantation of common firs, made by the
late Lord Fife, many years ago, deserves notice.  It is in the
vicinity of the boat of Bog, near the Spey.  It was twice
