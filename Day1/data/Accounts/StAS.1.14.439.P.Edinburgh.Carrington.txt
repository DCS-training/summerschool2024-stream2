     Of Primrose.

   Climate, Soil, Cultivation, and Produce.-The hills call-
ed the Moorfoots on the S., and the Pentlands on the N.,
by attracting the clouds in their progress from the W.,
render the climate of this parish rather drier than that of
the country on both sides of it, in their more immediate
neighbourhood.  In the eastern part of the parish, the
situation of which is low, the air is temperate; to the
westward, it becomes colder than, from the shortness of the
distance, and the inconsiderable elevation of the ground,
antecedent to experience, we should have naturally sup-

nure of a long series of years, which, in the infancy 
of agriculture, men always apply to the fields immediate-

ral superiority of the circumjacent lands to those that are
remote.  The produce of the parish consists of wheat,
barley, oats, pease, potatoes, turnips, and clover.  On the 
light and dry lands, the most approved rotation of crops
seems to be turnips or potatoes, oats, clover, turnips,
etc.  On those that are more inclined to wet and clay,
wheat after fallow is more frequent.  The plough, which 
is by far the most in general use, is that constructed by
Small, and drawn by 2 horses.  But a sense of the obvi-
