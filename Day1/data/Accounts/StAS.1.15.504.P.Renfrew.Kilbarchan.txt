   Cotton Mills.-At the bridge of Weir, on the north west of
the parish, there is a cotton mill, which contains 2120 spin-
dles ready for use, and might employ 70 hands if fully occu-
pied.  At present, from the dullness of trade, they only work
with 1664 spindles, and employ 49 hands, chiefly women
and children.
   But the most splendid establishment in the cotton spinning
business, perhaps in Britain, is the Linwood mill, on the
south east part of this parish.  The building is already finish-
ed, except one wing, which yet remains to be added.  The
length of building already compleated, is 254 feet; the length
when finished, will be 338 feet 8 inches; the breadth of the
body is 37 feet; ditto, of wings 40 feet.  The house is six
storeys with garrets.  It already contains 400 glass windows,
and, when cornpleated, will contain 540.  The depth of fall

when interrupted by tail water, they have another wheel,
more elevated, which they can put in motion.
   Mr Dunlop, the manager, has paid a very laudable atten-
tion to the health of the inhabitants, in the construction of
this building.  For this purpose, the roofs of the rooms are
high; the machinery is much simplified in its construction,
can be easily cleaned, and occasions little or no waste, or par-
ticle of cotton to fly about, and a large space is allowed, in
proportion to the machinery; of consequence fewer work-
ers will be crowded into the same space.  The whole appa-
ratus does not take above three half gills of oil daily:  hence
no bad smell arises from the oil.  Add to all, that the whole
building is subdivided by two vast stair-cases, which act as
ventilators.  If equal attention is paid to the instruction of
the children, I should consider a work of this sort as a school,
where the children of the poor, otherwise a burden upon
