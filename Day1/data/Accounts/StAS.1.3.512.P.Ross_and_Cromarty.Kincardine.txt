     Statistical Account

for some time concealed in Assint; but being discovered and
apprehended, he was sent prisoner to Inverness.  Attempts
were made to throw the odium of betraying this truly great
man on M'Leod of Assint, who was a royalist, and the friend
of Montrose.  He went to Caithness to meet him, but Mon-
trose moving southward, by a rout different from what Assint
had taken, the Marquiss's misfortunes, (his death was none
of them), had their full completion, before the Laird of
Assint returned to his own country.  His family suffered at

An Imperial crown, and a man on horseback, in the act of
darting a lance, are still very visible.  It appears to be the
half of a stone coffin; and tradition says, that the remains
of a Prince of Loellin, who died of his wounds in the neigh-
bourhood, were deposited in it.  There are several Dounds,
which are conjectured to have been Druidical temples.  They
were open at top, and, if the Bel of the Druids was the
Terminus of the Romans, if sufficiently accounts for their
circular construction, and aperture at top.  There are also seve-
ral of those circles of stone, so frequently mentioned by Ossian,
