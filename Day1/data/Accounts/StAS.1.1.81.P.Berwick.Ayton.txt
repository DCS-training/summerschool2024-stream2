particularly upon the boarders, with a view to engage the
people to a mutual defence and protection of their property,
in times of turbulence and hostility.  They are now divided,
have convenient farm-houses, and are highly improved.
Harvests are rather early here, than late.  The greatest part
of the lands in this parish is inclosed with hedges.  Fences
of this kind are recommended both by their beauty and uti-
lity.  The rise of rent seems to have operated here as a spur
to exertion and improvement in agriculture.  The farms
have rather decreased in number.  Some of them, though
but few, extend to 500 or 600 acres.

   Air and Distempers-The air is dry and salubrious.  The
fogs arising from the sea seldom penetrate above a mile from
the shore.  The ague was very common prior to the improve-
ments and inclosing of lands; but since that time this disor-
der had scarcely been known here, except during the last ve-
ry open winter.

   Horses, Sheeps, etc.-The horses bred and used here are
slender; but they are very active, and able to undergo
much fatigue:  They have advanced much in value.  The
breed of sheep is both good and large; their weight, at
an average, is about 18 or 20 lbs. per quarter.  Four of
their fleeces yield a stone of wool.  Five sheep may be
maintained upon an acre of some of the best lands.  The
number of sheep in this parish, till within these ten or twelve
years past, was small.  Great advantage arises from the large
breed lately introduced:  Besides yielding more wool, they
are fit for the market in two years time; while sheep of
the smaller size require to be kept three years before they
are ready for the market.  The wool of the large sheep is,
without doubt, of a coarser quality; but this disadvantage is
