this, he and the parson may walk forth together along the
meadow of Clunie, till they come to the bank of the Lu-
nan.  Here, turning their faces westward, let them enter
"the windings of the woody vale;" let them trace up the
borders of the Lunan; let them examine the park of Laigh-
wood, and ascend the den of Richip*, and thus saunter a-
way the heat of noon "among the low]y children of the
shade."  Leaving the woody den, let them hie to the hea-
thy hill; let them climb the brow of Ben-achally, where
they will find plenty of the arbutus-uva-urfi, (bear-berry),
and there also they may taste the delicious juice of the vac-
cinium, vitis idaea, (the whortle berry, or Highland breigh-
'lac).  From Ben-achally, let them direct their wandering
steps N. W. to Craigsheal, and dine on simple, hospitable
fare in the most distant and most Celtic habitation of the
parish.  Thence let them bend their course to Lochnachat,
and from that northwards along the summits of the hills,
picking up here and there a plant of the rubus chamaemorus,
(the averan or Highland oidh'rac); and, if its fruit be ripe,
they will find it very refreshing.  Wheeling about to the
right, at tile north western extremity of the district, let
them descend through the forest along the Brannatire;
where, if fatigued and thirsty, they may pause a moment,
and regale themselves with the fruit of the empetrum-ni-
grum, (crow-berry), that grows there in abundance.  Pro-
ceeding S. E. along the hill, if they mark well, they may
have the happiness of finding a specimen of the white-
flowering heath, which they may clap into their botanical
box, if by this time it can hold it.  When they get down
to the Craig of Forneth, provided they have not left the
fun and light of day behind them, they may there gather

*In this den they will find the Convallaria Verticillata, a rare and
beautiful plant.
