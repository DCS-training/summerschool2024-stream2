gow, and seem to find it for their advantage.  But our people,
though the Northlanders are said to be enriching themselves
by the practice, do not seem inclined to follow their example,
in fishing at all times, or for all sorts of fish, though they are
accustomed to, and fond of the fishing of herrings.  This is so
much the case, that many of them, bred to trades, as weav-

young women servants, who get from 15 s to L. 3.

   Poor.-The poor of the parish, (i.e. such as get any as-
sistance from the poors box) amount to 40 or upwards, chief-

share of the collections at the church-doors, being the only
public charity they receive, is not sufficient in general, to pay
the rent of the hut wherein they live, and to purchase a pair
of shoes for the winter.  They are supported mostly by the 
private donations of the more opulent in the parish, who would
