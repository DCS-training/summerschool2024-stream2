general not very handsome, as the common people pay little
attention to the improvement of the breed.  They are equally
negligent with regard to their black cattle; but it is hoped,
that the prizes, which the gentlemen of this country mean to
distribute annually, among the owners of the best bulls, will
have the effect of improving the breed of cattle.  The breed
of horses, too, would soon improve, were every considerable
proprietor to keep, a handsome stallion for the use of his te-
nants.  The sheep of this country are of the black faced kind,
and came originally from Linton.  They are hardy; but their
wool is shaggy and coarse.  The average price of wool, this
year, is 8 s. per stone.  The carcase weighs about 2 stones Dutch.
Had the hill grounds been let to experienced sheep farmers
from the south country, the breed of sheep, and the wool,
would perhaps have been more improved by this time, and
higher rents given for the sheep walks.  But as there advan-
tages could not easily be obtained, without depopulating the
country, the proprietors have let the hill grounds to their old
tenants, contenting themselves with what rent they can easily
afford to pay.  A few of the Cheviot sheep have been lately
introduced into the stocks kept in the low grounds, for the
use of private families, and thrive very well.  The hill te-
nants, however, seem unwilling as yet to make trial of them,
as they think them too large for their pasture, and not hardy
enough for standing out severe winters.  As the pasture im-
proves under the sheep system, a larger species of that animal
will be gradually introduced.

   Rent and Proprietors-The arable land, in general, lets from
about 10 s. to 15 s. per acre; a small part of it, indeed, for 20 s.
and upwards.  The hill grounds are not let by measure, but by
the lump.-The proprietors are 12 in number; of whom only
2 of the greater, and 1 of the smaller heritors reside in the pa-
