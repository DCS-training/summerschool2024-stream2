merly this parish was divided into small farms and each 
farmer kept several cottagers; but now the farms are
much enlarged, and the farmers, at least many of them,
seem to have imbibed a strong prejudice against all cot-

cause of this decrease in population, may be the want of
fuel; the parish affording no peat, and the coal, at the
distance of near 8 miles, very high priced at the hill, and
generally very bad in quality, which makes fuel a dear
article to the poor*.

   Soil, Agriculture, &c.- The foil of this district is for
the most part of a light black mould, with a close red 
clay, and tilly bottom, which makes it generally very 
wet, and the crops late in harvest.  To remedy this, the
farmers, for the most part, sow early oats, commonly 
called Carnwath oats, and some barley oats, which are
still earlier than the former, but they must be sowed up-
on fine rich land, otherwise they produce but a scanty
crop.  Yet, after all, from its local situation, and a large
moss to the eastward, the early frosts in August and Sep-
tember, off times, in one night, blast all the hopes of the
most industrious husbandman, by destroying his crops.
   The farmers, in general, are industrious.  They plant
a considerable quantity of potatoes; they likewise sow 
as much grass-seeds and turnips as they can, which ge-
nerally very well repay their labour.  There are about
