ants are mostly young men, who being licensed to preach,
are candidates for the holy ministry.  They are paid, when
assistants, commonly by the minister; but sometimes by
the minister and parishioners, and in some instances by the
parishioners only.  Their business, as assistants, is to preach,
catechise, and visit the people, at the desire, and under the
sole direction of the minister.  Some few of them, owing

admitted to full orders, and in consequence may administer
the sacraments.  They generally continue in office during
the pleasure of the minister: but some of them, who have
procured an interest in the patron's favour, are, by the
consent of the minister, ordained assistants and successors.

   School.-The parochial school, under the wise direction,
and regular attendance, of Mr Gow, the present schoolmaster,

wages and the hours of attendance seems in no respect to
be reasonable.  The school begins, during summer, at nine
in the morning, dismisses at twelve at noon; meets again at
two in the afternoon, and dismisses at five in the afternoon.
It commences, during winter, at ten in the morning, and
continues, without intermission, till three in the afternoon.
When the time of attendance is considered, and especially
the incessant labour that must be undergone in teaching a
parochial school, it will appear, that the established schoolmas-
ters in this district, and generally all over Scotland, are but
