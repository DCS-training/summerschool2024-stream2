   Agriculture, etc.-  The parish contains about 39,000
acres, Scots measurs, which is calculated from the number
of square miles it amounts to. 700 acres, at present, are used
for the purposes of agriculture:  Little more than the half
of which is annually in tillage.  This computation is made
from the quantity of grain sown, which is 312 bolls oats,
14 bools bear, 126 bolls potatoes.  The woods occupy
1500 acres; 36,800 are in pastures for horses, black cattle
and sheep.  The farms are very unequal in extent.  There is
one of L.200 Sterling of rent; several about L.100l;
some not more than L.20.  The proportion of arable land
in each farm is small; the price of labour is high; the land
unevenly, and of an inferior quality;  the climate unfavour-
able for raising crops; a number of horses are required for
the labour, which, through the greatest part of the year, are
a dead stock on the hands of the farmer.  These circum-
stances render the arable land of so little value, that in ta-
king a farm, it is only looked upon as a conveniency, and
a rent is only given in proportion to the number of cattle
for which the farm can afford pasture.  At an average, the
pasture grounds may be valued at 13d. the acre; but at this
rate, the whole rent is laid on the grass grounds.  There
are in the parish 175 horses, 821 cows,12,280 sheep.  The
average produce is 1092 bolls of oates, 613 bolls bear, and
1512 bolls of potatoes.  The crops that are raised very nearly
supply the inhabitants.  About 100 bolls of imported
meal are brought; but there is nearly an equivalent of bear,
of meal and potatoes, sold to distilleries in the neighbour-
hood.  Upon comparing the number of inhabitants with
the produce, it will appear that each person's share is very
small; but a number of men and women leave the parish in
summer and autumn, and go to public works; such as fish-
ing, cutting wood, manufacturing barks, and harvest-work
in the south of Scotland.  The valued rent is L.267: 16: 9
