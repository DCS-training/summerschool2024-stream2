     of Houstoun and Killallan.

Nielstoun parish, on the south, to the braes and hills of Kil-
patrick on the north.  The soil in the plain is generally
good, part clay, part loam, or mixed, and the rents high.
The mansion-house of Barochan stands on a freestone rock,
and Houstoun on a whin rock, about one English mile from
each other, and both almost on the verge of the plain.  There
is a large moss in the plain, not far from Barochan, of many
hundred acres, from which the country all around get peats
for fuel.

   Air and Climate.-The air in the upper parts of Houstoun
and Killallan is sharp in winter; the snow covering the
ground when there is scarce any at Houstoun and Barochan,
and none in the plain below; and the harvest is often above

Duchal and Kilmalcolm, than in any other part of the neigh-
bouring country.

   Wood and Planting.-There is a large natural wood at
Houstoun, consisting of oak, alder, birch, willow, and some
ash; besides a great quantity of old planted timber about the
mansion-house, consisting of elms, plants, ash, limes, and
some oaks; many of which have been lately cut down and
sold at a good price.  There is also a considerable natural
wood at Barochan, and another at Boghall, a small barony
on the north side of the parish, the property of Boyd Alex-
ander, Esq; of South Barr, and was once the seat of another
family of the name of Fleming.  There is also a great quan-
tity of planting about the mansion house of Barochan, con-
sisting of ash, plane, oak, larch, and fir.

part of the parish, by the union of small farms.  About forty
