     of Chapel of Garioch,

is of a very irregular figure: Its greatest extent, from N. to
S., is about 8 miles; and from E. to W., about 7.  The ap-
pearance of the country is hilly.  The soil is of various qua-
lities; in general, it is very improvable.  The air is suffi-
ciently dry and healthy.  The W. end of the parish is indeed
subjected to frequent showers, from its vicinity to the hill of
Bannochie.  There are no distempers peculiar to the parish;
the most prevalent are fevers and rheumatism.  The water of
Ury runs through the parish for several miles.  It abounds
with fine trout.  Pike is also to be found in some of the pools;
but no salmon, excepting in the spawning season.

   Woods, Agriculture, and Produce, etc.-Trees of all kinds
thrive well; and there are plantations, of considerable extent, on
the estates of Logie, Pittodrie, Balquhain, and on the lands
of Afforsk, belonging to Sir Archibald Grant, in the parish.
It would be highly beneficial to this part of the country, that
trees were more cultivated than they are.  A great deal of
ground in this parish is fit only for planting.  Wood has, of
late, become much more scarce in this district than formerly,
and has of consequence risen greatly in value.  The number
of acres is not ascertained.  The greater part of the arable
land is employed in raising oats and bear.  Some of the farms
are of considerable extent, and will sow between 50 and 60
bolls of grain.  There are few enclosures in the parish, ex-
cepting upon the farms in the possession of the proprietors;
consequently sown grass or turnips cannot be much culti-
vated*.

of turnips and sown grass in this parish; and his example in farming has been
successfully followed by many in the neighbourhood.  The crop of one field,
