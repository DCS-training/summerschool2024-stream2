provements and manufactures, or by any of the proprietors.

   Ale-Houses.-There is every reason to complain of the
number of obscure tippling houses, in this as well as the ad-
jacent parishes.  These have the most baneful effects in injur-
ing the health, wasting the substance, and debauching the mo-
rals of the people.  Many, by haunting them too often, bring
ruin on themselves and their families.  It is much to be wish-
ed, that some effectual course were devised and put in execu-
tion to crush them.

   Character.-The minister, however, has the satisfaction to
say, that the inhabitants of the parish, in general, especially
those of the better sort, are sober and industrious, moderate in
their principles, and decent in their conduct; and free from those
contracted notions and religious prejudices, which are still
prevalent in more northern parishes, and some other parts of
Scotland.
