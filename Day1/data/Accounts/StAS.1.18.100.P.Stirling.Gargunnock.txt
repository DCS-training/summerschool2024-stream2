of the ground.  The root soon withers and dies.  Nothing
however can do the business so effectually, as the plough; and
when the grounds are again thrown into pasture, the cattle
will prevent them from relapsing into their former wild state,
for a long course of years.
   Gargunnock-house, now the seat of Col. Eidingtoun, stands
on an elevated situation, near where the dry-fields are united
to the carse; and commands an extensive prospect.  Though
of an irregular figure, it contains good accommodation for a
genteel family.  Some parts of it are evidently of ancient
date.  On the east wing, there is a sort of tower, which
gives it a dignified aspect on that quarter; and until a few
years ago, there was a high wall, and strong gate in front of
it, which indicated that it was designed as a place of strength.
It is probable the Peel, which was at a little distance, having
been abandoned, or fallen into decay, it became necessary
that the mansion of Gargunnock should be so constructed,
as to become a place of safety to its inhabitants.
   The barony of Gargunnock, for near a century past, be-
longed to the family of Ardkindlas; and the late Sir James
Campbell, whose memory will be long dear to the parish,
having resided chiefly here, was at great expence, in making
improvements both on the house, and the adjoining fields.
The removal of the wall and gate, marked the manners of
the times.  The garden and orchard, which were immediate-
ly under the windows, were also removed; high grounds were
levelled; an addition was made to the house, in a modern
style: A sloping bank was formed on the east and south,
where the garden formerly was, and where sheep now feed;
and from the high road, to which he gave a new direction,
an approach was made to the house, far superior to any in
this part of the country.
