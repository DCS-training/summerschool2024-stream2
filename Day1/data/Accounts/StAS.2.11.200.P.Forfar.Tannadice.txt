thriving larch, lately planted by the Earl of Airlie; and nearer
still, the castles of Cortachy and Innerquharity, with their policies
of aged wood, the South Esk winding amongst them its dark,
troubled, and noisy way to the ocean.--About two miles farther
down the stream, stands the house of Inshewan, very lately built
by its present worthy occupant, John Ogilvy, Esq. who constantly
resides there with his family. On the north of this house is a
moor lately planted, which promises soon to become a great orna-
ment, and to afford much shelter.--About four miles still farther
down, stands the house of Tannadice, built about thirty years ago
by Charles Ogilvy, Esq. who acted about twenty years as a sur-
geon in the East India Company's Service. It has in front, the
Esk, with a bridge over it of three arches, and the castle and hill of
Finhaven, and is surrounded by young planting of the proprietor's
own raising.--Nearly opposite, and on the other side of the water,
is the house of Whitewell, the property of--Gemmel, Esq.
which he_inherits from a paternal grandfather. There are also
the houses of Easter Ogle and Wester Ogle, and Glenquiebh:
and on Wester Markhouse, Major Swinburn has just built a hand-
some dwelling in the style of the English cottage.
