                             III.-POPULATION.

              In   1755, the population amounted to            761
                   1791,                                       830
                   1801,                                       768
                   1811,                                       814
                   1821,                                       834
                   1831,       males 386, females 398          784
                   1835,             390,         400          790

   From the preceding statement, it appears that the population
has been very fluctuating in point of numbers. The rapid dimi-
nution of nearly, eight per cent. between 1791 and 1801, is ac-
counted for by the removal, during that period, of several public
works, which employed a large number of operatives; and also by
the consolidation of some of the smaller farms into large ones. The
large increase from 1801 to 1811 is explained by the fact of a
different family, with a household of forty persons, then occupying
the mansion-house of Salton. The decrease between 1821 and
1831 is also explained by the circumstance of Mr Fletcher's house
having been rebuilt during the former period, and a large number
of artisans of different kinds having been then domiciled in the pa-
rish.
