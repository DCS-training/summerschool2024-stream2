have embraced the liberal proposal of their landlord, have
executed their plantations on the Captain's principles and
ideas.  This officer, after an absence of 12 or 13 years in the
service of his country, returning again to his native soil, in
the year 1784, and finding his property then a perfect waste,
took up the resolution of enclosing it with double stone fences
and ditch.  After which, it occured to him, that the interme-
diate space included between the fences, might as well take in
(if it could be so contrived) all, or greatest part of the worst
soil; and thus he at last conceived the comprehensive and un-
common design of fencing the arable by the barren ground;
not doubting, when the latter was filled with all proper kinds
of young trees, that his best fields would thereby, in due
time, be well secured and protected from blighting winds and
storms.  Every succeeding year gives fresh testimony of the
propriety of the original plan:  For it has been executed un-
der almost every disadvantage, particularly his own absence,
and the intermediate management of people incapable of en-
tering fully into his views.  The plan for watering the farm
of Templand, is no less worthy of notice, than the planting,
though the proprietor's absence, and many other unfavour-
able circmstances, have united to render the success less.
However, there is sufficient evidence from the little that has
been done, that water sediment, and other effects arising from
flooding, with large streams, is probably the very best me-
thod of meliorating ground, and exterminating the most per-
nicious weeds.  It also appears from the Captain's experi-
ments, that water properly conducted through young timber
plantations, is the cheapest and best method of encouraging
their growth.  This gentleman's ideas in conducting great
currents of water for agricultural purposes, have been ex-
tended to carry plans of inland navigation into execution,
upon moderate expenses, as appears by his epistolary corre-
