tion.  It affords, indeed, a striking instance of the good eco-
nomy of building manses, etc. in a substantial manner, and
upon a liberal plan, instead of doing it, as too often happens,
according to the lowest estimate.  While other manses,
within the bounds of this presbytery, have been built and
rebuilt, some of them more than once, the manse of Sorn
has already stood firm and unbroken for nearly 60 years,
and will probably do so for many years to come.  It like-
wise still maintains a respectable station among its neigh-
bours, even in a country where the heritors have, of late,
displayed a commendable liberality in the building and re-
pairing of churches and manses.  The offices are in a very
indifferent condition, and will soon require to be rebuilt
from the foundation.  About 10 years ago, the inside of
the church was repaired, and seated anew, and three gal-
leries were erected in it; so that it is now a very decent and
commodious place of worship.
   In a small parish in the neighbourhood of a town, where
a horse and man-servant can be dispensed with, a glebe can be
let, and is therefore a real advantage, in proportion to the
rent which it brings:  But in a remote and extensive parish,
where a horse and man-servant are indispensable, a small
glebe may be considered as a necessary evil, because the pro-
duce is by no means equal to the expence unavoidably at-
tending it.  This was exactly the state of the glebe of Sorn
till the year 1793, when, upon a representation of the case,
the heritors and presbytery readily concurred in granting an
augmentation of 3 acres and 3 roods.  In consequence of
this augmentation, the glebe, which formerly consisted only
of 5 acres 3 roods and 3 1/4 falls, including the garden and site
of the houses, now consists of 9 acres 2 roods and 3 1/4 falls,
which, when duly improved, will equal, or perhaps even
a little exceed, the necessary expence.
