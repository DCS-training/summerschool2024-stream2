of villages, and the introduction of the cotton-manufacture
into various parts of this neighbourhood.  But the above
are only arguments for a local, not a general depopulation

   Rivers, and Salmon-Fishing.-The water of Tarff runs
in a direction from N to S. through the west side of the
parish, and forms a junction with the river Dee at the
farthest S. point of it.  It takes its rise from a lake called
Lochwhinnock, in the parish of Girthon.  It abounds with
trout and pike, and in the summer and harvest there are
sea trouts, called herlings, and grilse and salmon, which
run up into it from the sea.  In floods it affords good sport
for the angler.  Its banks, in some parts, are adorned with
natural wood, and fine natural meadow-ground.  There
are two bridges upon it, one about the middle of the pa-
rish, where the military road from Carlisle to Port.  Patrick
crosses it, and another farther S. near its extremity, where
it joins with the river Dee, and where there is a harbour
for shipping.  Here there is a great quantity of lime and
sea shells imported every year for manure, during the sum-
mer season.  The river Dee runs on the eastern and south-
ern sides of the parish.  It is a large and rapid river.  Op-
posite to this parish its bottom is rocky, and its banks are
steep and rugged, and adorned with natural wood of vari-
ous kinds: This gives it a bold and romantic appearance.
It abounds with salmon in the fishing season, which begins
generally in the month of February, and ends the 26th of
August.  But few of them get above the works, termed
Doachs, erected across the river, nearly opposite to the corn-
mills and church of Tongland, excepting in very high
floods.  Above and below the church and manse, the bot-
