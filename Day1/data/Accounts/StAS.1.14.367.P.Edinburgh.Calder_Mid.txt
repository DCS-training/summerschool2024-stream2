to the carbonic acid in calculous affections, might lead a 
person to suppose, that it contains a portion of that acid;
but it was evident to me, on examination, that it did
not.  Dr. Beddoes, in his Observations on the Nature
and Cure of Calculus, etc. asserts, that it is not the 
carbonic acid, but the alkali; which is generally admi-

effect.  Perhaps it may be allowed, that they both have
a tendency to remove this disease.  The alkali then,
which, in conjuction with sulphur, forms the he-
patic smell of these waters, may be the principal agent 
which yields relief to patients in cases of gravel; and
the attenuated sulphur, which constitutes a part of the 
hepatic vapour, may be the mean of promoting a cure 
in serofulous disorders.  But the truth is, that in mi-
neral and calcareous waters there are many combina-
tions, and volatile substances, whose nature and effects
are hitherto unknown.

   Eminent and Remarkable characters.-Among the few
persons of note in this parish, whose names have been
handed down to us, I shall begin with Sir James Sandi-
lands of Calder.  He was a man of ability and eminence,
and being a knight of the order of Malta, he was, by

in Scotland, and where the ruins of their house and 
chapel are still to be seen.  He was engaged in several 
important negotiations during the Reformation of reli-
gion in Scotland; and when Popery was overturned, the 
preceptory of Torphichen was converted into a tempo-
ral barony, and it, together with the title and dignity
