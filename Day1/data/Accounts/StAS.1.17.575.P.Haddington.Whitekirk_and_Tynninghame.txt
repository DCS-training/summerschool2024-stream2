discharges itself into the Frith of Forth in the east part of
this parish.  The fish found in the Tyne are trout and gilses,
neither of which are remarkably plenty.  A few salmon are
sometimes found, but they are very rare.  The right of fish-
ing the Tyne up to the Knowmill, and the sea coast at its
mouth, from within a cable's length of Westbarns burn to
the water of Peffer, an extent of nearly two miles, belongs
solely to the Earl of Haddington.  A great number of seals
are always to be seen swimming about the mouth of the river,
which are thought with probability to be one cause of the
scarcity of other fish.  The tide flows about two miles up
the water, and might be made navigable to that height at no
great expence.

   Agriculture, Wages, etc.-This parish, in general, is in
the highest state of cultivation.  The turnip husbandry is
now carried on to a great extent.  About 100 score of sheep
are annually fed on turnip, and all fed in flakes upon the
ground.  The sheep generally fed are Highland wedders,
which are bought in October for about 12 s. or 15 s. and
sold again, from February to May, at from 20 s. to 25 s. per
head, and will then weigh from 12 to 16 pounds a quarter.
The number of sheep fed on grass, during the summer, will
be about 50 score.  There is also a considerable number of
black cattle fed annually both on turnip and grass.  Few
sheep or oxen are reared in the parish, but the most of the
farmers breed their own cows and horses.  The kinds of
grain commonly raised are, wheat, barley, oats, beans, and
pease.  There is also a great quantity of turnip and sown
grass raised annually, and potatoes sufficient to supply the
parish.  Each farmer raises a few acres of flax for his own
family and servants.  The usual and most approved rotation
on those lands which are adapted for turnip-husbandry, is,
