sea, and on the N. by the two great harbours of Loch-Sea-
forth and Loch Resort, separated at the Lewis march by an
isthmus of about 6 miles, is somewhat of a triangular space,
forming a very obtuse angle at Tarbert.  The distance from
Tarbert, along the W. coast to the mouth of Loch-Resort,
is 18 miles.  From Tarbert to the mouth of Loch-Seaforth,
the distance may be called 7 miles.  Proceeding in a straight
course from Tarbert to the Lewis march, if we may be allow-
ed to suppose a straight course practicable through the inter-
vening obstacles, the distance may be called 10 miles.  This
mountainous region resembles a number of sugar loaves placed
on their bases in contact with one another and broken at top
into the various forms of peaks, protuberances, and excre-
scences; perhaps the rudest specimen of nature's workmanship.
The general appearance is rocky, but there is some coarse
pasture in the valleys, and in the interstices of the rocks along
the sides of the mountains.  Along the western shore there
are a number of creeks, and inlets of the sea, most of them
commodious barbours, at each of which a colony of tenants
has been placed, who contrive by a wonderful exertion of
industry, to rear as much barley, oats, and potatoes, as serves,
with the help of their fishing and other earnings, to support
their families.  Towards the northern extremity of this shore,
there is one farm, called Huskmish, which contains some
extent of arable land, being a rich mixture of black earth and
shell sand.  The eastern shore is also inhabited by a set of in-
dustrious tenants, who cultivate a soil of the most forbidding
aspect, so are some patches along the sides of Loch Resort
and Seaforth.
   The Northern Isles inhabited are, Taransay, Scalpay, and
Scarp.  Taransay is a high rocky island, about 4 miles long
and 1 broad, lying in a western direction from the mouth of
West Loch Tarbert.  Scalpay is a low, heath covered, round
