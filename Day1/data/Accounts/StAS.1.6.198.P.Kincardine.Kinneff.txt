hills, mostly covered with heath; wherein is to be be found a
coarse stone with a rotten surface, at a small depth under ground.
The soil, particularly along the coast, is a fine rich loam mix-
ed with clay; yielding plentiful crops of wheat, barley, beans,
peace, and sown grass, when improved in the modern man-
ner, by fallow, draining and lime.  The higher grounds at
some distance from the coast, yield good crops of oats, bear,
peace, turnip, and grass: and the industrious farmer, by ju-
dicious management, here finds his labour well rewarded.-
As the parish lies high, without lochs or swamps, the air is
very healthy.

   Rivers, Sea-Coast, and Minerals.-There are only 2 or 3
small rivulets in the parish; which, by means of dams, make
a shift to turn water mills, principally in the winter season.
-The shore, which bounds the parish on the E. for about 5
miles, as mentioned above, is bold and rocky; the tide reach-
es the foot of the rock, which rises abruptly from 20 to 60
yards in perpendicular height.  The rock is for the most part
of the pease-porridge or plum-pudding kind; and is thought
to have the appearance of lava.  The soundings all along the
coast, at 100 yards or less from the shore, are from 8 to 13
or 14 sathoms.  There are no rocks which cannot be seen at
low water.-The strata of the rocks dip to the S. W. from 30
to 40 degrees.-The bold shore, leaving only a small space
of the rocky bottom uncovered at low water, but a small quan-
tity of kelp, perhaps only 4 or 5 tons annually, is made in this
parish; and, for the same reason, the sea-ware is of little be-
nefit.-The best creek in the parish is at Caterline, belong-
ing to the Viscount Arbuthnott, which has two boats; and,
if some money were laid out in raising a small pier at this
town, where there is a good situation for it, it would afford a
convenient and safe harbour for coasters 300 or 40 tons burden;
