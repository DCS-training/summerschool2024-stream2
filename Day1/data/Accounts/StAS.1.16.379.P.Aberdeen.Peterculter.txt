     of Peterculter.

     "The slash first strikes the eye, and then we hear
     "The clap, which does more slowly reach the ear;
     "For light and images of things, still fly
     "More swift than sound, and quicker strike the eye."

   The clap of thunder I have mentioned was awfully loud,
and was preceded by a vivid stream of fire both together
impressive of that solemn period, when the seven thunders
shall utter their voices.  But lest I should offend any, in
this age of new philosophy, by a quotation from the sacred
page, I beg leave to present to their view, a few lines from
the fore-cited author:

     "Cuinon animus formidine divum
     "Contrahitur' Cuinon correpunt membra pavore,
     "Fulminis horribili cum plaga torrida tellus
     "Coatremit, et magnum percurrunt murmura colum?
     "Non popuh, gentesque tremunt?  regesque superbi
     "Corripiunt divum perculsi membra timore,
     "Ne quod ob admissum fode, dictumve suherbe,
     "Ponrum grave sit solvendi tempus adactum?

     
     "What mind's not shaken?  and what soul not aw'd?
     "And who but thinks the angry gods abroad
     "Whose limbs don't think when dreadful thunder hurl'd,
     "Roars in the clouds, and shakes the frighted world?
     "What do not cities, do not nations fear,
     "When dismal desolation seems so near?
     "Then do not tyrant kings and haughty lords,
     "Repent their wicked deeds and boastful word s
     "Do they not tremble at approaching doom,
     "And fear their dreaded punishment is come."
