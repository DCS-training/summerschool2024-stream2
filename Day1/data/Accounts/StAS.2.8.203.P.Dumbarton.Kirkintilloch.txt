obtained in the year 1824, (5 Geo. IV. cap. 49.) The origin-
al capital was L. 32,000; but, by a new act in 1833, (3 Wm. IV.
cap. 114,) the total capital was raised to L. 52,000. The north-
ern terminus is at Kirkintilloch, and the south-east at Palace Craig,
in old Monkland, including a length, in all, of about eleven miles.
The distance between the rails is 4 1/2 feet. The railway was at
first laid with rails weighing twenty-eight pounds to the yard, but
these have been found much too light, and the whole is now in pro-
cess of being laid with rails weighing forty pounds per yard. No
passenger waggons are allowed on this railway. It is connected
with the Ballochney, and Glasgow, and Garnkirk railways in the
south, and these penetrate into all the great mineral deposits in
Lanarkshire. Great quantities of coal and iron are transported
by this railway to the depot in the Forth and Clyde Canal.The
coal is of very superior quality, and is laid down in the town of
Kirkintilloch, at the rate of 15s. per waggon of 48 cwt. In 1835
about 49,000 tons of coals, and 3325 tons of pig-iron were ship-
ped on the canal from the railway.
   The Forth and Clyde canal runs for about six miles along the
northern border of the parish. It was commenced in 1768, by
virtue of an act, 8 Geo. 111. cap. 73, but was not finished till
1790. The total length from sea to sea is thirty-five miles. The
highest point at Windford Loch is 156 feet above the level of the
sea. The average width at the surface is 56 feet, at the bottom
27 feet, and the depth of water is nearly 10 feet. Vessels of 19
feet beam, 68 feet keel, and drawing about 10 feet water, can
pass along the navigation. In its course, the canal passes over
10 large aqueduct bridges, and 33 smaller ones; and 33 draw-
bridges are thrown over the navigation for the crossing of public
and private roads. In all, there are 39 lochs, each 74 feet long
between the flood-gates, and 20 feet broad. The canal is sup-
plied with water by eight reservoirs, covering 721 acres. The ca-
pital stock of the company in 1820 was L. 519,840; the income
in 1836, was L. 63,743, 16s. 7d. The total original expense was
L. 345,618, 12s. Allowing eight acres of land to a mile the
mere ditch of the navigation in this parish will occupy 48 acres.
There are seven swift iron-boats on the canal for the conveyance
of passengers, which travel at the rate of ten miles per hour. The
following is the number of passengers booked at the drawbridge
of Kirkintilloch, near the manse, for the periods specified, in 1837:
