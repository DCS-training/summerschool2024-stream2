		            PARISH OF GAMRIE.*

	     PRESBYTERY OF TURRIFF, SYNOD OF ABERDZEN.

		     THE REV. THOMAS WILSON, MINISTER.

		I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THF, parish of Gamrie, or, as it has been named at
different times, Gamery, Ghaemrie, or Gemrie, according to ge-
nerally received tradition, derives its name from a Gaelic word,
Kemrie,-signifying a running leap or runninq Fght,-on account of
a bloody engagement with the Danes on the spot where the old
church now stands.
   Extent and Boundaries-The parish is about 10 miles long
from east to west, and from 3 to 4 broad. It is bounded on the
north by the Moray Frith ; on the east, by the bronk or burn of
Nethermill, which separates it from Aberdour; on the south, by
King-Edward ; and on the west, by King-Edward, Alvah, and
the r ver Doveran, which separates it from Banff.
   Topographical Appearances.-The surface of the parish is ex-
ceedingly diversified by hills, glens, and precipices. This appears
to be occasioned by the singula nature of the sea-coast, which is
skirted by a narrow ledge of stupendous rocks, running the whole
length of the parish, and of the eastern adjoining one of Aberdour'
in some places perpendicular towards the sea to the height of 600
feet, and in all precipitous. The bay of Gamrie is formed by the
jutting out into the sea of two headlands, Gamrie-head and Troup-
head, leaving between them a large open bay, with fine anchorage
ground for vessels of any size. The view of the'coast from sea,
outside the bay, is much admired. At the bottom of the bay, the
rocks, which are steep and rugged on either side, retire a little,
leaving room for the village of Gardenstown, and no more ; and
then they rise with just as much bend from the perpendicular as
allows mould to lie upon them, which is closely covered with green
grass, except here and there a winding footpath like a, staircase, on
