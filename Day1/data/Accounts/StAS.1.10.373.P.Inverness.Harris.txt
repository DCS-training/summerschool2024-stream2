grows here, though nothing is more certain than that the
country was once wooded all over.  The gentlemen plant
some bushes and shrubs in their gardens, which fade as soon
as they overtop the walls.
   A singular deviation from the common course of the tides
prevails in the Sound of Harris.  The people say (and will
not be contradicted in their assertion) that, from the autum-
nal to the vernal equinox, the current, in neap tides, passes
all day from E. to W. and all night in the contrary direc-
tion.  That immediately alter the vernal equinox it changes
this course, going all day from W. to E. and the contrary at
night.  In spring tides the current corresponds more nearly
to the common course of ebbing and flowing.  The writer
has sufficient experience to testify the unaccountable irregu-
larity of the tides in this sound, but he has not been able to
ascertain, whether the fact with regard to the neap currents
be precisely such as is stated, with so much confidence, by
the people.  The most destructive process of Nature is, the
continual wasting of the land on the western shore, by the
perpetual drifting of the sands, and the gradual incroach-
ment of the sea.  This is evinced by the clearest testimonies.
Lands, which were ploughed within the remembrance of
people yet living, are now no more.  Wherever a high sand
bank has been entirely worn away, the soil under it is found
to have been either a rich loam or black moss.  In many
such situations, vestiges of houses, inclosures, churches, and
burying grounds, appear.  In the island of Pabbay, where
the sea ebbs out in spring tides to a great distance, there are
visible, at the very lowest ebb, large trunks of trees; the
roots of which, spread out widely and variously, are fixed in
black moss, which might be dug for peat to a great depth.
Nor is this peculiar to Harris.  The same, and other phae-
nomena of the like kind, are observable along the whole
