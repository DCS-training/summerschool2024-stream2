     (COUNTY of Renfrew.-Presbytery of Paisley.-Synod of
     Glasgow and Ayr.)

     By the Reverend Mr ROBERT BOOG.

     Situation end Extent.

   THE parish of Paisley is in length, from east to west,
about nine miles, varying in breadth from half a mile
to about three.  Till 1736, the parish extended over the
town of Paisley; but an additional church at that time be-
coming necessary, the town was erected into a separate parish
and the original parish has, since that period, been distin-
guished by the name of the Abbey parish, or, more properly,
the parish of the Abbey Paisley.
   No satisfactory etymology has hitherto occurred of the
name Paisley.  The following has been suggested by a good
Gaelic scholar: "A ridge of rocks that runs across the
river, and forms a beautiful cascade, would, prior to the
building of the town, be undoubtedly the most striking ob-
ject that this place would present.  The brow or face of a
rock is, in Gaelic, Pais-licht.  A church in front of the rock
would be the church in Pais-licht.  A church did stand here
previous to 1160; it is named in the foundation charter Ecclesia
de Paselet, Latinized, in the records of the monastery, Pasle-
tum, an easy derivative from Pais-licht, in all probability the
original of the modern Paisley."
