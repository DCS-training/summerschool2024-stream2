ployment is the making of barley to supply the Glasgow
market.  Part of it, indeed, is exported to the West In-
dies, where it serves for the food of the negroes, being pre-
ferred by some to rice.  The carts that convey the barley
to Glasgow, are loaded back with rum and sugar, for the
Edinburgh markets, which back carriage is their sole pro-
fit, and allows the dealers to vend these articles on the same
terms with those in the immediate vicinity of Glasgow.  A
single horse, in this trade, will transport often near 3 ton

   River.-The river Leith, takes its rise in the western
extremity of this parish, at a place called Leith-head, from
3 large springs, which receive various additions in their pro-
gress, particularly at the village of Balerno, where they
are joined by Bavelaw burn.  Its whole course includes a
track of not above 14 miles; yet, in this short space, it drives
no less a number than 80 odd mills of different descrip-

of the capital, is upwards of L. 20 Sterling per foot of wa-
ter-fall.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The only disadvantage
to the introduction of manufactures into this parish, is the
want of coals, which are brought from between 8 and 9
miles distance.  At the same time, every part of this and
the adjoining parishes exhibits strong indications of the
presence of coal.  A number of small crop seams have been
found in a variety of directions; and, in one place, at the
western extremity of the parish, a seam of no less thatn 2 1/2
feet thick has been discoverd, a the depth of only 10 fa-
thoms.  Besides, this district of country is surrounded with
coal on all sides, and according to the report of one person
still living, coal was actually wrought in one part of the pa-
rish.  At any rate, if once the intended inland navigation
