the public, by making an excellent road, along the E. side of
Megget, between James' Town and Waulk-Mill; and, in the
line of this road, which is three miles and a half, has built
4 stone bridges, of one arch each.

   Eminent Men, etc.-The present family of Westerhall are
all natives of the parish; and they have distinguished them-
selves much, and are well known in the world.  Mr. PULTE-
NEY, who married the heiress of Bath, is one of this family,
was the late Governor JOHNSTONE, whose bravery as an
officer, and whose information and eloquence as a senator, are
sufficiently known, and will long be remembered.  Here,
too, are deposited his remains, over which, and many of his
ancestors, John Johnstone of Alva, Esq. has erected a very
elegant mausoleum.  This is a piece of excellent architecture,
and must have cost 700 L. or thereabout.  The parish gave
birth also to Commodore PASLEY, who at this instant com-
mands the first division of the van squadron of Lord Howe's
fleet, as it lies in line of battle at Torbay.

   Antiquities.-Besides the remains of the Druidical temple
above mentioned, vestiges of encampments may be traced on
the tops of several of the hills in the N. W. end of the pa-
rish.  These seem to have been out stations of the Roman
camp, which bears the name of Castle-o'er, in the S. end of
the parish of Eskdalemuir; and there are others along the
banks of the Esk, which were probably formed as part of a
chain of communication between Castle-o'er and the camp at
Netherbie, in the neighbourhood of Langtown.  There is
a great number of burians in the parish.  These are all of a
circular form, and are from 36 to 50 yards diameter*.
