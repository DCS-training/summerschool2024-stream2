The inhabitants, excepting one born in England, are all
natives of Scotland, and mostly of the parish.  With regard
to their religious persuasions, they are all of the Established
Church, except 2 old Scotch Episcopalians, and 4 of the
Church of England.  There are a few Seceders, principal-
ly women, who are natives of other parishes, and who en-
deavour to train up their children, particularly their daugh-
ters, in the principles of their own persuasion; these Sece-
ders, old and young, may be reckoned about 20*.

   Character of the People.-The generality of the parishion-
ers are disposed to honest industry and good neighbourhood.

* Numbers of the people reside in paltry villages, containing each from
20 to 50 inhabitants.  M lder has begun, in the neighbourhood of his
house, a new village, on a decent plan A few of the houses are finished,
and some tradesmen are already established there.  To each of the families
will be allotted some portion of the adjoining ground, for the purpose of
raising greens, potatoes, etc.  By which means the wild bank, where the
village is situated, may be soon brought into a state of high cultivation;
and the village itself may, in a short time, become a place of some conse-
quence.  At any rate, such attempts to improve the country, are highly
commendable.
