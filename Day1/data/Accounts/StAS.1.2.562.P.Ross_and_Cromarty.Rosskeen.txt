     Statistical Account

rishes in the north of Scotland, are very inadequate to the
end, and few more so than this one.-It were much to be
wished, that some plan could be devised for the increase of the
funds for the relief of the necessitous poor, in such cases as the
one under consideration, without subjecting the kingdom, to
the heavy burden of a general tax.

   Patron, etc.-The Earl of Cromarty was patron of this pa-
rish, before the forseiture in 1746.  The present incumbent
was settled on a royal presentation in 1783, before the resto-

one, and, together with kirk, kirk-yard dyke, its offices,
and the parish school, were all put in complete repair, in the
years 1780, 1781, and 1782.  Very few country parishes have

manse, of 4 English acres of good and fertile soil; the other

and a half, in 3 different divisions, which are let by the mi-
nister to a tenant in the neighbourhood.

other parishes of this presbytery; but it is worthy of remark,
that, though that language does not seem to be losing ground
in this parish, many more read and understand the English
language, than did some yeras ago; a circumstance which is
