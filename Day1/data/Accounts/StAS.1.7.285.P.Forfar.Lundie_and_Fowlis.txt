measured miles, and the medium breadth somewhat more
than one.  It contains 1200 acres of arable land, and 744 of
hill, wood, and pasture ground.-The soil is, in general,
rich, well cultivated, and mostly inclosed.  The ground has
an easy slope towards the south, which renders the situation
very agreeable.  There is only one hill, called the Black
Law, which, though noted for good pasturage formerly, is
now become of little value, by the total removal of sheep
from it.  There are neither rivers nor rivulets in either of
the parishes, but several lakes.  One, which was called the
Piper Dam, and which covered 55 acres, was drained about
15 years ago.  A considerable quantity of marl, as well as of
peats, has been dug from it.  It not only supplies the parish,
but part of the neighbourhood, with that species of manure,
and yields a considerable rum yearly to the proprietor.

   Heritor, Tenants, and Rent-The whole parish is the pro-
perty of Sir William Murray of Auchtertyre, Baronet, who
does not reside in it.-More than one half is occupied by one
farmer and his son; another farms 180 acres, a third 150,
and the rest is divided into about 20 small farms.  The rent
is above 1000 L. Sterling.  The farms let at from 10 s. to
20 s. an acre.

   Agriculture, Produce, and Cattle-About one third of the
arable land in this parish, amounting to nearly 400 acres, is
laid out in green crops, grass, turnips, potatoes, and flax.
The rest produces wheat, oats, and barley.  Foulis was the
first parish in this country where a regular rotation of crops
was attempted.  It is about 20 years since the proprietors
introduced it, and the success encourages the continuance.
The seed time is the same as at Lundie; and the crop is
generally all cut down and gathered in by the 1st of October.
