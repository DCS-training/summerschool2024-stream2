on the clay when soft. Fragments of six larger urns, more highly
ornamented, and better burned, were found in other parts of the
field. This field is now called Arches or Archer's Croft, Stone
coffins have also been found at Lawhill, Greenhall, &c. There is

structure made of flags like the sole of an oven, was lately dis-
