possessors, do not appear to add to the regularity of the place;
it is therefore hoped, that the proprietor of the village, who
has already been planning out a broader street, will take care
that a new one be rebuilt after a more approved model; and it
a bridge over the North-Esk river at Mary-kirk, which is now
in contemplation, and to which a subscription is already
opened, should take place, it would not only be an advantage
to the village, but to the country in general.  To promote
this, not a few of the farmers and inhabitants for a good many
miles through the Mearns, have already subscribed; and if
the heritors of this parish, and other gentlemen in the neigh-

accomplished.  This is the more to be wished, as within
a few years, 2 persons have lost their lives at the Ford,
and Ferry-boat; and many other individuals, by not being
acquainted with the proper entry to the Ford, or by the inat-
tention or ignorance of some drivers of carriages, have been
exposed to the most imminent danger.  It is to be observed,
that the North-Esk, oft times in rapid torrents, not only de-
scends the Grampian hills, overtops its banks, and inundates
the valleys below, but with impetuous violence sweeps every
thing before it; so that strangers ought by no means, to enter
rashly into this river.

situated in the middle of the village, has long been in a state
of decay, and bears the marks of great antiquity.  It is 96
feet long, and 17 broad.  Its walls are much sunk in the
earth, and the floor and area are in different places, at least
4 feet below the burial ground on the outside of the wall.
There is an aile, on the south wall, opposite to the pulpit where
