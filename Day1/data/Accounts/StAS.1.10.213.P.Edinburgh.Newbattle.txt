track shows a surface marshy and unproductive.  In this pa-
rish, indeed, the extremes of fertility and of barrenness bor-
der upon each other; for, on the S. W. quarter, there are
many hundred acres worth scarcely half a crown each of rent;
while in the valley of Newbattle there are several inclosures,
let for tillage, at 4 L. an acre.
   Upon the best lands, the ordinary rotation is, 1st, wheat
after fallow; 2d, pease and beans; 3d, barley, sown down
with grass feeds; 4th and 5th, hay crops; 6th, oats; after
which the ground is fallowed again, or cropped, where the
soil is light, with potatoes.  In the upper grounds, which are
swampy and exposed, the land, are kept several years in
grass.  On its being broken up, a crop of oats is taken; this
is succeeded by a green crop; after which, the most common
method is to sow down oats with grass seeds*.

   Minerals.-Limestone and coals are found in abundance in
this parish, the whole of which may be said to be under-laid
with them.  The coal, particularly, produces every year
above 1000 L. of free profit; and yet we felt as much as

This evil was not, as some have supposed, an effect of the in-
creasing demand.  The truth is, that the colliers can earn in
three days as much as may support them very fully through
the week; they become dissipated and untractable; they in-

*Upon the highest point of the hill already mentioned, and
which is 680 feet above the level of the sea, there are the re-
mains of an ancient inclosure, well known by the name of the
Roman Camp.  Being crowded with firs, it is of difficult access,
and cannot be examined with a proper degree of accuracy.  It
is of quadrangular figure, with an opening to the S. E.  It
contains nearly 3 acres of ground, and seems, from its position,
to have been wisely chosen, as a place both of defence and of
observation.
