                       PEEBLLES-SHIRE.

The decrease of population has been owing to the extension of
farms. The whole property of the parish belongs to nine indivi-
duals, only one of whom ranks as a resident heritor. There are
only five or six individuals that can be called resident tenants.

Character and Habits of the People.-The people in general live
in comfort, and scarcely any are unable to lay in their mart for
winter. Poaching prevails to a considerable extent both in game
and salmon; but, on the whole, the people are intelligent, moral,
and reliious. The shepherd's plaid is universally worn.

At Tweedhopefoot, two miles north from Tweedshaws, there
live a well-known character in his day, called Jamie Welsh, and
ironically nick-named the Bairn of Tweedhopefoot, a perfect Milo
in physical strength, huge in corporal bulk, and having " a heart
of oak," in respect of personal courage. His putting-stone is still
shown, and it is a heavy lift for any ordinary man. It is said that
he carried a load of meal (16 stones) on his back all the way from
Peebles, a distance of 24 miles, and only rested twice.

Agriculture and Rural Economy.-The number of English acres
actually under tillage and enclosure does not exceed 300. But it
is impossible to calculate how much is arable, a great proportion
of the mountains being quite capable of cultivation; though, from
the expense of lime and other causes, it is not considered an ob-
ject to bring it into that state. Oats, barley, turnips, pease, pota-
toes, and artificial grasses are the usual crops, and succeed well.
The average return of grain is six bolls to one sown. There are o
acres in undivided common; and the number of those under wood
does not exceed 25.

Rent of Land.- The average rent of arable land per acre is 18s.
The average rate of grazing is L. 3, 10s. per ox or cow, and 5s.
per ewe or full-grown sheep pastured for the year. The valued
rent of the parish stood thus in 1819:
