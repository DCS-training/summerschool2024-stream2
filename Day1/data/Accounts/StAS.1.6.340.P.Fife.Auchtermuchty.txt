     Statistical Account

   Cattle.-Much attention is paid to the breed of cattle; a
great many are reared of good size and great value.  Of late
the cattle dealers from England have been in the habit of pur-
chasing them privately, which has injured the markets consi-
derably.  They give from L. 6 to L. 12, before they are fatten-
ed; and calves new dropt, which could have been purchased
a few years ago at 4 s. to 5 s. last season gave from 10 s. to 12 s.
It is so far well for the country, that there is such a demand;
for, considering the advanced price of labour, and the high
rents given for land, it either the cattle or grain were to di-
minish much in value, none of those tenants who have got
new tacks could possibly pay their rents; a circumstance to
which gentlemen of landed property would do well to attend,
if they regard their own interest, and the comfort of such a
respectable and useful body of men.

   Population.-On account of the different sectarists in this
parish, which will be afterwards more particularly taken notice
of, it is difficult to ascertain with precision the increased of po-
pulation; as these sectarists seldom register the births of their
children in the books appropriated for that purpose; but it is
the opinion of some aged inhabitants, whose veracity may be
depended upon, that the number of the inhabitants and houses
within the town, has encreased at least one half within these
60 years.
