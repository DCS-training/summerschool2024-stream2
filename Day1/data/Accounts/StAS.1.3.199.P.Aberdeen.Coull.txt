   through the midst of which, a small rivulet, but so still
as to be hardly perceptible, till you come near to Tarland,
which is about two miles to the west.  In consequence of so
long a level, the bog often rises to an extraordinary height,
forming a sheet of water, aboutb a mile square, full of wild
geese, and ducks; the last of which remain throughout the
year; the former make their apperance about the middle of
September, and continue till about the end of April.  There
are few fish, to be found in this bog except pike.  There
are no remarkable mountains here; the hills around are
bleak and barren, affording pasturage only for sheep.

     Population.-The number of inhabitants is from 460 to
470, men, women, and children, included.  There are 205
males, and about 260 females.  The number in Dr Web-
ster's report is 75 I.  In this parish there are no instances of
extraordinary longevity, which are well authenticated. It
would also be extremely difficult to fix the precise num-
ber of farmers here, for every man is a farmer in his
own way.  A man of stone wealth and standing in the
country, takes immediately from the proprietor 100 or 150
acres of arable land, and becomes accountable to him for the
rent of this quantity; he will perhaps retain  one third or
one half of the best of it in his own hand, and let the re-
mainder to the poor dependents in his neighbourhood. As
there is no market for potatoes here, the farmer raises only
as many as serves his own family.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-This parish enjoys no pe-
culiar advantages, except a fine pure air, and a warm lively
soil.  Its disadvantages are:  I.  It lies in a inland country,
far from marketm and the means of improvement.  Aberdeen,
the nearst sea-port, is 30 miles east.  2. This disadvantage
