			PARISH OF TYNRON.

		PRESBYTERY OF PENPONT, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.

	 	  THE REV. ROBERT WILSON, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--THE name of this parish, according to Chalmers in his
Caledonia, was anciently written Tyndron; Tin-troyn, or Tin-droyn,
in the ancient British tongue, and Dun-ron in the Irish signify
"the fortified hill with a nose." The name was applied to a round
hill, which is still called the Dun or Doon of Tynron.
	Extent, Boundaries.--The length of this parish, according to Mr
Crawford's measurement and the county plan, is 10 miles, and its
breadth 3, which gives an area of 22 1/2 square miles, or 11,332 Scots
acres; but I am inclined to think that it cannot be less than 12
miles in length, and about 2 1/2 in breadth. Upon consulting the
plans of the dilterent estates, to all of which have had access,
the real measurement is found to be 11,796 acres, 3 roods, 17 falls.
Tynron is bounded on the north by Penpont; on the east by
Keir; on the south by Glencairn; and on the west by Glencairn
and Dalry.
	Topographical Appearances.--There are two ranges of hills in
this parish, running from south-east to north-west. The one range
terminates in thd Doon of Tynron, and the other in the Doon of
Maxwellton, in the parish of Glencairn. Lamgarroch and Cormil-
ligan Bale are the highest of these hills,--which may be about 1800
feet above the level of the sea. The character of the hills is in
accordance with the greywacke formation to which they belong, with
the exception of Craigturrah and Croglin Craig, which are more
precipitous. The climate upon the whole may be considered
healthy.
	Hydrography.--The only rivers are the Shinnel and the Scar.
The former divides the parish into nearly two equal parts. The
other forms the boundary with Penpont for about three miles on
the north. Both rivers run in a south-easterly direction; but the
Shinnel at the farm-house of Ford takes an easterly course until it
	DUMFRIES.                H h
