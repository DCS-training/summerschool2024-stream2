     of Holme.

   Poor.-There is no other fund for the maintenance of the
indigent, but what arises from the collections, on the Sab-
bath days, and at sacramental occasions, with the dues of
marriages, mortcloth, and fines, amounting to between L. 3
and L. 4 Sterling.  The list is seldom under 12.  Such of
them, as are able to travel, beg, and the infirm are supplied
from this fund, and the charitable donations of the people.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is one corn mill that
goes by water, and two by wind.  There is no lint mill, al-
though it is much wanted.  The Honourable Society for im-
provements, would, doubtless, upon a proper representation,
advance money for the first erection of one.  At present, the
flax is manufactured with brakes, switches, and coarse hec-
kles.-There are no foxes nor badgers, but some otters.
There are no rivers, but some small rills of water run
into the sea.  Opposite to their junction are caught delicious
and large sea trout, from one to 8 pounds weight.-There
are no trees rshrubs of any species.  There are a few singing
birds, as larks, linnets and wrens; and a number of the ra-
venous kinds, as eagles, hawks, ravens, crows and owls; and
sea-fowls of various sorts, such as are to be met with through-
out the north of Scotland.  No person has been criminally
prosecuted or banished this parish in the annals of time.  There 
are several new improvements made upon the commons, but
of no considerable extent.  The proprietor encourages the
industry of settlers, by exacting no additional rent during
their lives.  But the turf has been so long peeled off for com-
post in the dunghills, that it is next to impossible to improve
the ground, which discourages their attempts.  There are
several barrows observable in the parish and its environs.
Some of these have been opened and found to contain
small stone urns, with ashes in them.  Nothing else remark-
able has been observed and discovered therein.
