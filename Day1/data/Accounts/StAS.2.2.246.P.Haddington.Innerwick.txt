                 V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Markets.-The market-towns resorted to are chiefly Dunbar,
Haddington, and Dunse. From the village of Innerwick, the first
of these is four miles distant; the others are more than thrice as
far.
   Villaqes.-The villages of the parish are Innerwick and Thorn-
tonloch. The former is situated at the distance of about a mile
from the London road. It lies at the foot of a steep but cultivat-
ed hill. It is tolerably neat and clean, but in its appearance some-
what straggling and irregular. Thorntonloch lies on the coast,
almost close to the London road. It is occupied to a considerable
extent, though not exclusively, by the servants of the adjoining
farm. Many of its cottages are very- bad.
   Means of Communication.-About two miles of the great road
between Edinburgh and London are in this parish. The Mail,
the Union, and a Berwick coach, which all run daily on that road,
afford expeditious and convenient means of travelling. The other
roads in the lower district of the parish are kept in good repair,
and afford great facilities for the conveyance of produce to market.
There is no post-office in the parish, but by letter-carriers and
other means of communication a tolerably regular convevance of
letters is secured from the post-town of Dunbar. A carrier pas-
ses through the parish, by the London road, once a week on his
way to Edinburgh, and once a week on his return. As small har-
bour at the Skateraw shore, erected some years ago by the late
Messrs Brodie of Thorntonloch, and Lee of Skateraw, is used for
the exportation of lime, and the importation of coal.
   Ecclesiastical State.-Walter Stewart, to whom, as has been al-
ready stated, was granted by David I. the manor of Innerwick,
