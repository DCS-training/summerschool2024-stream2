ther in Appin, with a salary to each of them, from L. 18 to
L. 80 Sterling yearly, over and above the school emolu-
ments.  The salaries arise in part from a parochial assessment
of 4 d. in the pound of old valued rent, amounting to 200
merks Scots yearly, and partly from money mortified by
King William for establishing schools in these parishes.
There is an excellent good new school-house in Appin.  The
school-house in Lismore is very bad; but there is money for
building a new one.  There is one school, with a salary of
L. 10 Sterling yearly, at the Slate Quarry in Glenco, grant-
ed by the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge.  Thed
number of scholars is so fluckuating, that they cannot be easily
ascertained.  The school in the Straith of Appin consists of
60, and sometimes 80 scholars.  The Society School at the
slate Quarry consists of about as many; and the one in Lis-
more of 40 or 50.  There are sometimes one or more smaller
schools kept up at the expense of the inhabitants in the
more remote parts of the parishes.

   Antiquities.-There are some Druidical cairns, or conical
heaps of stones, in different places in the parishes, which for-
merly contained urns or earthen vases filled with ashes, and
some pieces of human bones.  One of thesef cairns, of very
considerable magnitude, and of a regularly conical form,
stands within a very small distance of the cathedral.  One
of these earthen vases or urns, containing ashes, and pieces of
human sculls and bones, was turned up last year by the
plough in a neighbouring farm.  In the island of Lismore,
there are several vestiges of Roman fortifications; and parti-
cularly an old castle, with a fusee and draw-bridge, said to
have been built by the Danes, or Scandinavians, when they
insested these coasts.  There is also, within half a mile of the
cathedral, one of the circular towers so frequently to be met
