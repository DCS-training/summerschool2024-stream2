   Stipend, Poor, etc.-The stipend is 82 1/2 bolls victual,
and L. 22: 8: 3 6/12 money, besides a manse and glebe of a-
bout 4 acres.  The church was originally a parsonage, be-
longing to the Abbey of Arbroath; and the greater part
of the present stipend is payable from abbey-lands in that
neighbourhood.  Towards the end of the 12th, or in the
beginning of the 13th century, a donation of the parish
was made to the abbey by Sir Allan Durward of Len-
trathen, and this donation is said to have been confirmed
by a charter from the Hostiary of Scotland, of date 1253.
From the time of the donation by Sir Allan Durward, un-
til some years after the middle of the 16th century, the
lands of Kingoldrum continued in the possession of the Ab-
bey, and about the year 1565, the greater part of them is
said to have been feued cum decimis inclusis.  The burden
of the stipend continued still to fall upon the Abbey, and
after the erection of the Abbey into a temporal lordship, it
devolved upon the titular of the tithes.  The consequence
of which was, that, by the decreet of provision, dated in
the year 1635, more than one half of the present stipend
was allocated upon abbey-lands in the neighbourhood of
Arbroath, from which it continues to be payable to the
minister of Kingoldrum till this day.-In a parish in which
there is no village, and scarce any householders who have

work is performned by the same number of servants, than in any former
period; because a third, or certainly less than a half of the same farm
yields better grain, and a greater quantity of it, than the whole did 30 or
40 years ago; and because his grain, his horses, and his cattle, his poul-
try, his butter, and his cheese, are brought to a better, and for the
part to a ready-money market.
