payable to Lord Armadale, in name of teinds.  The yearly 
value of all the glebes, and a lispond of butter, (32 libs.
Dutch), payable out of a small farm in the parish of Bir-
fay, is about L. 20 Sterling.  There are also manufactured,
on the thores of the glebes, nearly two tons of kelp yearly.
   There is a very decent sensible schoolmaster in Evie,
with a salary of L. 12 Sterling per annum, paid by the So-
ciety for Propagating Christian Knowledge; he is exceed-
ingly well attended; sometimes, in winter, by 90 scholars,
from whom, however, he derives little or no emolument.
By his great care, diligence, and prudence for near 40 years,
in this office, he has been of the greatest advantage to this 
parish.  There are also a kind of two parochial schoolma-
sters in Rendall, and on the consines of both parishes, with 
a salary of L. 3 each, with some trisling school-fees, of about
40 s. each; but there are no tolerable school-houses in either 
parish.

   Tides and Harbours.-A Very strong tide runs along the
shores of these parishes, from the Western Ocean at Costay 
Head, to Damsay Sound. and Kirkwall Road; the tide of 
flood running from north west to fouth-east.  Besides the 
harbour in Gairsay, there is another very good one for mo-
derate sized vessels at Aikerness in Evie; and as, to the fouth-
ward of Enhallow, the shores are all land-locked, and good
anchorage, a vessel may ride in every bay.
