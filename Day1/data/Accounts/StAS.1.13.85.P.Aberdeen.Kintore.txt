also trout, eel, pike, and sometimes a kind of slounder, but 
these are sold.  A stream rises in the marshy parts
of the parish, and enlarges so as to have three water-mills in 
its course; for the first and longest part of its course, it is 
called the Sherrif-burn; but when it goes on, it si called the
Couning-burn, from a burrow of conies that was kept here;
and near Kintore, where it falls into the Don, the burn of
Tuack.  There is another mill upon the Don.  The most
part of the parish is thirled to a mill; none now except the
small heritors of Kintore pay multure.  They pay for ser-
vice, called knavesbip, the 33d peck.

   Population.-By the return made to Dr Webster, the
number of souls then, was 830.-No proper account can be
given of this subject for any time past, though the people
formerly were certainly more numerous than at present.
The old parish, before the annexation, was said to contain
between 700 and 800 souls; and about 200 were added by
the annexed part of the parish of Kinkell.  It contains
at present, including the town, 862 souls, whereof 392 are
males and 470 females.  The knitting of stockings, partly
accounts for the proportion of females, though that manu-
facture is much on the decline, and the price reduced, since
loom frames have been so much improved; and many of
the males learn trades, and go to other places, there being
no tradesman or manufacturer here of any kind, but what
are necessary for the work in the parish.  Baptisms in 1792,
were 13, 8 males and 5 females.  Average of births
for 5 years past 16, ditto marriages 6, ditto of deaths,
or rather burials 14.  The air is healthy, and the people 
not much liable to consumptions, fevers, or epidemical
distempers.  Many of the inhabitants live till between 80
and 90.  One farmer lately held his plough, till several
years above 80.
