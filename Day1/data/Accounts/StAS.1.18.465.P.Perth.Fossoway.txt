6 for meal.  The one for lint, is on the Dovan near the
Crook.  It is well employed, and of general utility.  The
corn-milns have all a thirlage, that is, so many proprietors
bound by charter, and so many tenants by leases, to bring
their grain to those milns.  There is also one barony thirled
to a miln which is not in the parish; which, from its distance,
it is at all times very inconvenient to use; and in the winter
season, almost impossible.  Thirlage operates in every in-
stance as a tax on industry, and is in a high degree unfavour-
able to the improvement of the country.  It would perhaps be
better for the proprietors of the milns, as well as for the ge-
neral advantage of the country, to sell the thirlage; which
the heritors are not only willing to purchase, but for which
they would give a good price; though in most cases, the con-
venience of the situations would lead them to bring their
grain to the same milns which they use at present.

   Schools.-There are two schools in the parishes; one situated
at the Crook of Dovan, and the other at Blairingone.  The
one at the Crook is the parochial school; and the school at
Blairingone, is for the benefit of the children belonging to the
work people of the colliery.  The teacher at Blairingone has
very small encouragement; nothing but what arises from the
wages paid him by the scholars, and a small subscription, which
does not exceed L. 9 annually.  If nothing more can be pro-
cured, it is probable, that in a short time this school will be
given up, to the great detriment of the village.  The salary
of the parochial schoolmaster, is L. 5: 11: 1 1/9 d sterling, per
annum, in money, with a piece of land, worth about the
same sum; and the emoluments arising from the offices of
precentor and session-clerk.  Parochial schoolmasters com-
monly receive a good education, are a body of men of great
importance to this country, and certainly deserve much better
