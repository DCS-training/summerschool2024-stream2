     of Campsie.

   Antiquities.-There are few in this district which merit
description, except two Caledonian Forts; and even these
scarcely arrest the attention, unless so far as they prove that
the Caledonians chose to occupy places of strength directly
opposite to the Roman wall, no doubt with the design of
watching the motions of the legionaries.-These mounds
are perfectly circular, with regular fosses; the one is styled
the Meickle Reive, in the language of the country, and is a-
bout a hundred yards in diameter:  The other is styled the
Maiden Castle, about twenty yards diameter:  They are both
situated at the foot of the Campsie Fells, to which the na-
tives could easily fly, if attacked; and ly due North; at the
distance of two computed miles, from the peel of Kirkintil-
loch, said be be one of the chief Roman stations on the wall.
   There have been several urns found in the parish, contain-
ing ashes and burnt bones; the urns were about five inches
in depth, and fifteen in diameter; made of course clay, ap-
parently basked in the sun; a species of freize work encircles
the lower edge; they have been found in cairns, generally
placed between two flags.
   It may not be improper to mention, that Campsie, (before
the disjunction and annexation took place,) extended for
eleven English miles along the Roman wall; and, of course,
many skirmishes must have taken place in this strath, betwixt
the legionaries and Caledonians: after a particular exami-
nation of the country, I have not the smallest doubt, but that
the security of this Roman barrier, depended more upon the
almost impassable swamp formed on the North side, than on
the strength of its forts; even at this day, it would be no dif-
ficult matter to lay the whole valley under water from Bon-
ny, to Balmully bridge, where Graham's dyke crosses the ri-
