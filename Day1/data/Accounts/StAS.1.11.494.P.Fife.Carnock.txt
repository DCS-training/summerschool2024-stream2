convenience from the badness of the roads.  In summer they
are tolerable, but in winter, or during a long course of rainy
weather, they are hardly passable, owing to the softness of
the soil, and the great number of heavy carriages.  It is hop-
ed, however, that this inconvenience will soon be remedied,
by a proper application; or reasonable commutation of the
statute labour, as well as by the erection of turnpike roads;
the advantages of which, being already felt in some of the
neighbouring districts, are now more generally acknowledged
than formerly.

   Inns and Ale houses.-There are about to small inns and
ale-houses in the parish, viz. 4 in Carnock, 5 in Cairny-hill,
and 1 in Blair.  Although these, as well as most other ac-
commodations, and enjoyments in life, are and may be abus-
ed to the purposes of intemperance, yet it must be admitted
that several houses of this kind are necessary in country pa-
rish, for the convenience of travellers, and the accommoda-
tion of the people who come from a distance, to attend public
worship on the Sabbath day.  Perhaps, however, the number
at present in this parish might be diminished, without any
great inconvenience, or rather, probably, with advantage to
the inhabitants.

   Houses and Cottage, etc.-Within these 10 years, about

rish.  Scarce any have been pulled down, except some cot-
tages belonging to the colliers, who frequently move from
one colliery to another; and the habitations being flight and
superficial soon go to ruin.  Two or three huts, possessed by
small tenants, have also become ruinous, but the number of
cottages erected within that period greatly counterbalances
