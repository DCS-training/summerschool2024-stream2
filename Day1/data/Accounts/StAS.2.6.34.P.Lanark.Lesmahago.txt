easily procured.

		4. The number of persons at present under 15 years of age,	        2968
						    upwards of 70,                       313
	There are about 90 small proprietors in Lesmahago; of whom
at least 50 have rentals of upwards of L. 50 a-year.
	The increase of the population betwixt 1821 and 1831 may be
accounted for by the facility with which even boys engaged at
weaving got possession of money; able to earn considerable wages
before they had acquired sense to manage them, many hurried into
matrimonial connections; and their wives being equally young and

	Character and Habits of the People.--The people in general
may be said to be of cleanly habits, which are impaired, however,
in some degree, by the influx of strangers. Their style and man-
ner of dress, however, may be said to be rather expensive, the ser-
vant-girl dressing as gaily as the squires' daughters did thirty years
ago. The difference in their table has nearly kept pace with that

are not so contented nor independent as formerly; nor is their
general character for morality or religion improved; while there
cannot be a doubt that pauperism has greatly increased. The
number of illegitimate births, during the last three years has been
27.
	Until,the weaving of cotton was introduced about forty-five years
ago, no trade or manufacture was carried on beyond the wants of
