whole inhabitants, men and women, ran down, and by main
force, dragged her up the beach, out of the reach of the
waves, which would otherwise have dashed her to pieces.
This again had another effect, that none but flat bottomed
vessels could navigate here.  It is but lately that two of these

are absolutely necessary at this port, and another body of the
same sort are equally serviceable on the other side of the Chan-
