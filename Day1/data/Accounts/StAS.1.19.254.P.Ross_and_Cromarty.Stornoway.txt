   Cave.-Not far from the farm of Gress, there is a large
cave, accessible only from the sea, where there was about
50 years ago a vast number of seals killed annually, and the
practice is still continued, but now seldom more than seven
or twelve are destroyed.  The method of killing is this:
A number of people assemble about low water, and carry
a boat into the cave as far as she can proceed; they take
from the boat a pot, which they have filled with live coal,
and with which they light their torches; they then fall
upon the poor seals without mercy, with clubs shod with
iron.  The entry of the cave is very steep and narrow on
its sides, and does not admit more than the breadth of a fix-
oared boat.  After going in a great way, the light of day
becomes somewhat obscured, and they then meet with a
large pillar, which divides the cave at this place into two
large openings or arches, by one of which they enter, and
walk a long way under, where they meet with large tum-
bling round stones, surrounded in part with water.  As
they advance further in, they come to a fine pleasant beach,
where they meet with the seals; further in still, there is a
small chamber, which by the light of the torches appears re-
markably white, its roof being all covered with white sta-
lactite, which are hanging from the roof, like to large ici-
cles; some of them put on the figure of hieroglyphics, and
each of them seems perforated from the base to the point
with a small tube.  It is within very high, and sounds very
loud, when the voice is exalted, but has no particular echo.
From the outer entry to the innermost part of it, is no less
than one-eighth of an English mile.
