	The town-court is held on Thursdays. This is also the seat of
the Sheriff-court for the middle ward. About twenty-five procura-
tors are licensed to practise before it; of whom eighteen belong
to Hamilton. The court day is Friday. The Justice of Peace
Court sits on the first Monday of every month. There are also a
record of seisins, a tax-office, a stamp-office, and an excise-office.
	In 1816 a Trades Hall was erected in Church Street. There
is a spacious hall in the upper storey for the meetings of the trades,
while in the under flat there is every accommodation for a respect-
able tavern.
	Besides numerous societies or trades, (which are all in terms
of the act 5th William IV. chap. 40) there are a St John's Lodge
No 7, and two other mason lodges, two gardener's societies, and
a Wallace friendly society.
	Gas-Work.--A gas-work, on a very elegant plan, was erected in
Hamilton by subscription, in the summer of 1831, at the expense
of L.2400. Three hundred L. 10 shares were subscribed, of which
L. 8 has only been uplifted, and frnm the advance in the price of
such shares as have been transferred, there is a fair prospect of the
subscribers being liberally remunerated for their outlay. From ex-
periments made at this work by Mr Burns, the present manager,
it appears that a cubic foot of the richest cannel coal produces
about 400. cubic feet of gas. The price of gas when sold by me-
ter is 10s. per 1000 cubic feet, or Is. per 100 cubic feet. Every
cubic foot is nearly equal to five imperial gallons; of course 500
imperial gallons only cost 1s. which is at the rate of about 3d. per
puncheon. Besides private lights there are now about 130 gas
lamps illuminated throughout the town for nine months in the
