found who understood the management of pumps in coal-works:
this was John Young, a citizen of Montrose, who had been sent over
to Holland by the magistrates, for the purpose of learning the most
improved modes of constructing and using windmills.
	Eminent Men.--James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, who
makes so distinguished a figure in the civil wars of the seventeenth
century, first as the champion of the covenant, and afterwards in
the service of the king, was born at Montrose in 1612.
	In 1534, John Erskine of Dun, afterwards superintendent of
Angus, brought from the continent a Frenchman of the name of
Marsilliers, capable of teaching the Greek language, and establish-
ed him in Montrose, which is believed to have been the first place
in Scotland where this noble tongue, previously almost unknown in
the country, and an acquaintance with which was deemed to imply
a tendency to heresy, was taught.
	Andrew Melville, who has been styled the Father of Presbytery
in Scotland, born in the neighbouring parish of Craig, was educat-
ed in Montrose; and when, in his fourteenth year he was removed
to the University of St Andrew's, he surprised his teachers by his
knowledge of Greek, with which they were wholly unacquainted.
Here also James Melville, the nephew of Andrew, attended school,
and gives, in his Diary, a very interesting account of the manner in
which his education was conducted, and also of the kindness he ex-
perienced from the then minister of Montrose.

<TABLE=POPULATION>

			III.-POPULATION.

         In 1755, the population of this parish was      4150
            1790, about the date of last Report, it was  6194
            1801, by census,                             7974
            1811,                                        8955
            1821,                                       10338
            1831,                                       12055

	In the last census sailors were not included. Their number may
be from 700 to 800. Since 1831 the population has still conti-
nued to increase. In 1833 the proclamations were 89; baptisms
registered, 140; burials, 293. The proclamations and burials are
correct, but the baptisms are not nearly one-half of the actual
number baptised,--a circumstance which shows clearly the neces-
sity of a legislative enactment rendering it imperative upon parents
to attend to this important matter. Besides the families employed
in trade, manufactures, &c. there are considerable numbers who,
from various causes, have chosen Montrose as their residence; and
hence there is in it a class of society superior to what is to be found
m many country towns of like size.
