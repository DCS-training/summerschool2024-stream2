   Agriculture.-The face of this parish has been entirely
changed within these 25 years; and much praise is due to 
Sir William Cunynghame and Mr Monecrieff, the two resi-
ding heritors, for the great expence and unwearied applica-
tion they have bestowed upon improvements; for, "he who
"makes two blades of grass to grow where only one grew

none but a man of fortune could risk.  It was not till he be-
came a farmer on his own account, and had a rent to pay
like his neighbours, and continuing the same practice, which
being uniformly crowned with success, that prejudice gave
