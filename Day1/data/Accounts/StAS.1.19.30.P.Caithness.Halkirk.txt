     Statistical Account

this cause, and the vices to which it is an inlet, as well as
from other causes which are more necessary and unavoid-
able, it happens that we have a great number of poor.  But
what is much to be regretted is, that a considerable part of
this number consists of tenants who have been reduced,
either by the late unfavourable seasons, or by the insuffi-
ciency of their farms, and other shifts, with all their in-
dustry and frugality, to provide for the evil day.  The
number at present on the roll is 150; but it ought to have
been near double that number, were all theft who are in
indigent circumstances to be admitted.  So very low are
the session-funds, that none can be admitted on the roll but
the greatest objects, or such as are extremely indigent; and
even, in that case, they are not in the smallest degree ade-
quate to that number; for the only sources of our funds
are the Sabbath collections, and the fines arising from de-
linquencies.  The former is very trifling, more especially
because our men of money are not those who most fre-
quently come to church.  The latter, though more frequent
than could be wished, yet it turns out to no great account,
because, though they are very subject to these delinquencies,
they are yet on the whole very poor in purse.  They are
able to sin, but not able, had they been willing, to pay.
It is a pity that the civil arm does not interpose its autho-
rity, and the gentry their influence and example, as could
be wished, to strengthen the hands of the clergy in the sup-
pression of these destructive practices.  But to return to the
poor: At the annual distributlon of the funds, the share of
each individual poor on the roll, is no more, at an average,
than 2 s. at the utmost.  This, and the insufficiency of the
parish to supply their needs, is one great cause why num-
bers of them wander about, begging that charity which they
cannot get at home.
