     Statistical Account

ing of the heritors is called, and an additional assessment
is laid on, (but only upon the heritors and tenants), pro-
portioned to the demand.  Every pauper who comes upon
the roll must give in an assignation to all the effects be-
longing to them.  The poor too are buried at the expence
of the fund, amounting to 17 s. each, if adults.

   Prices, Wages, etc.-About 50 years ago, the prices of
provisions were greatly below what they are at this time;
butcher meat was not then fold by weight, but when
weighed after having been bought, was found not to 
exceed 1 1/2 d. lb.  Dutch weight for beef, mutton, and
pork; lamb was bought at 6 d. and 7 d. the quarter.  At
present beef and mutton are 4 d. pork 3 1/2 d. veal from
3 d. to 5 d. and lamb, even in July, is never below 3 d.
the lb.; at present (the beginning of April) it is 1 s. the
lb.  Wheat is from L. 1. 5 s. to L. 1, 12 s.; barley from
12 s. to 16 s. and oats from 10 s. to 14 s. the boll upon an
average; but the Berwickshire boll is a 24th part, or  1/2 peck
in the boll, larger than the Linlithgow measure used in
the Lothians.  The farmers servants who have families,
an engage by the year, are called hinds and receive 10
bolls oats, 2 bolls barley, and 1 boll peas, which two last
article are called hummel corn, a cow grazed in the
summer, and straw through the winter, 1/4 boll potatoes
planted, some lintseed sown, with some other small con-
sideration, the whole amounting to about L. 13.  A sin-
gle man servant receives from L. 6 to L. 8 a-year, with
victuals, but few single servants are now employed La
bourers by the day, are paid 1 s. in summer, and 9 d. and
10 d. in the winter quarter; in hay-time, 1 s. 6 d. with-
out victuals, except a bottle of ale at noonand another
in the afternon, with 1 d. worth of bread to each.  In
harvest, the wages of a man are from 1 s. to 1 s. 6 d.with
