natural fertility of the soil, and the improved state of agri-
culture, have been cultivated with remarkable success.  The

   Population and State of the Poor.-The population in
1755 was 438 souls.  The number of souls was found by
the minister, in the course of his parochial visitation in
April 1794, to amount exactly to 456.  From a recent
enumeration it appeared, that the inhabitants under 10

the last 10 years appears from the register to be 12.  The
annual average of marriages is 3, and that of deaths 6.

to the distressed; yet the attendance of many idle visi-
tors on the sick is extremely culpable.  They not only
hurt them in several respects, but also endanger their own
lives, and those of their neighbours.  On these accounts, the
indiscriminate practice of visiting the sick, whether it pro-
