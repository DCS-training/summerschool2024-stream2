          I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Origin of the Name.-BALLINGRY is said to signify the village of
the cross, and to be compounded of the Gaelic word Bal, a village,
and the initials inscribed on crosses in the fields, J.N.R.J. Jesus
Nazarenus Rex Judaerum, Jesus of Nazaretb, King of the Jews.
   Extent and Boundaries.-The parish is irregular. It is about
4 miles in length, and 2 in breadth. It is bounded on the
east by the parishes of Kinglassie and Auchterderran; on the
south by Auchterderran and Beath; on the west by Cleish; on
the north by Portmoak.

some of it dry and fit for any crop; on the south part it is of a
cold bottom, but well adapted for pasturage, in which a great part
of the land has been lying for many years.
   Wood.-About 57 acres were planted, more than twenty years
ago, with a variety of forest trees, on the south front of Binarty,
the only hill in the parish, which is now a very thriving plantation,
and a great ornament of the country. The larch soon rises above
the other trees. Including the above, there are about 127 acres
in planting on the estate of Lochore. A large ash tree on it was
struck by the lightning, in August 1831, which shattered a thick
branch, and rent the bark down to the earth. There are plan-
tations on other properties in this parish.
                     II.-CIVIL HISTORY.

Earl of Minto, Lord Dundas, Sir Walter and Lady Scott, Sir
