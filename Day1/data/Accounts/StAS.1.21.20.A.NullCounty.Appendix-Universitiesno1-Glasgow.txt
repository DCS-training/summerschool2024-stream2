   One might think, that, when to the former revenue of the
college were added these donations of Queen MARY, and of
the city of Glasgow, it must have been completely endowed
for the maintenance of 15 persons; yet it was soon found ne-
cessary to increase the revenue, and to diminish the number of
persons to be maintained by it.  For although the property
of the Dominican friars in Glasgow, was certainly very consi-
derable before the Reformation; yet,all that the college could
make effectual of that and all their funds taken together, a-
mounted only, by their rental, to L. 300 Scotch money*.
   A more effectual benefaction was made to this poor society,
in the year 1577, by King JAMES VI. in his minority, with
the advice and consent of the Earl of Morton, regent of the
kingdom.  That was the rectory and vicarage of the parish of
Govan, of which the incumbent was lately dead; and the va-

to the Crown, out of which the clergy of the reformed church were to be
maintained; partly, that those incumbents, during their life, practised ma-
ny arts to alienate their revenues to laymen, either from friendship or for
their own profit, by pretended feu-contracts, perpetual or long leases, and
many other means, which their private interest, their regard to relations, or
their hatred of the new religion, suggested.
   Some of these pretended alienations, made to the hurt of the College, were
afterwards reduced and annulled by the courts of law, some by arbitration.
Probably many more might have been reduced; but that very often the sub-
ject was too small to bear the expence of a law-suit, or the man in possession
too powerful to be sued by the College.
