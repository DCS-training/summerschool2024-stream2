parishes.  The value of the stipend in 1755 was L. 56, 16s. 8d.;
1791, L. 80; in 1798, according to Chalmers, L. 112, 2s. 8d.
The extent of the glebe is about eight acres, and it may be worth
L.1, 10s. per acre.  The manse, built about forty years ago, is
at present undergoing extensive repairs and additions to its ac-
commodation.
   Poor.-The number of poor who received parochial aid for
the year ending November 1838 was 12.  The amount of con-
tributions for their relief for that year were L. 30, 11s. 1 3/4d.; of
which L. 8, 8s. 2d. were from church collections; L.16, 8s. from
interest of stock; L. 5, l0s. 1 1/2d. from voluntary contribution by
the heritors; and the remainder from imortcloth, proclamation,
and other dues.
   Mortification.-In 1790, Mr James Scot, surgeon in Peebles,
mortified one acre and one rood of land in the neighbourhood of
that town, for educating poor children belonging to the parish of
Covington.

                   MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   At the period when the former statistical report of this parish
was published, there were not more than 630 acres in tillage.
There are now nearly 2000.  The rental of the parish in 1791
was L. 920 per annum; it is now about L. 2500.  The farm-
houses and offices are of a better description than formerly; and
the farmers are intelligent and enterprising.  There is still, how-
ever, a want of wood in the parish; and much might be done by
a judicious arrangement of belts of planting, to improve the climate,
and shelter the enclosures.
