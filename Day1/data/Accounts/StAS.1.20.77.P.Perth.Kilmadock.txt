   The evil arose from the abdominable servitude of thirlage,
and will continue so long as this servitude lasts.  The land-
lord birids his tenants to go to his own mill, and this mill
he lets for rent, supporting, by this plan, to increase his ren-
tal.  There never was a greater deception.  The multure
due to the mill is classed with public burdens, and so lessens
the neat rent paid to the master but were the tenant free,
he would give a rise-rent double the amount of the rent
drawn by the landlord of the mill.  The reason is obvious:
being bound to one mill, the multurer grows insolent, gives
bad service, and imposes on the tenants.  Hence the multi-
tude of law-suits for abstracted multures.  Why am I well
served by my tailor and shoemaker?-Because he is afraid of
losing my custom.  The same is the case with millers; and
the servitude of thirlage is fast wearing out.
   The common public places for the sale of grain are Stir-
ling, Kippen, and Callander.  Since the erection of the A-
delphi cotton-mills, a considerable market has been opened
in Doune.  The average distance to markets may be rec-
koned 8 miles.  An account of the fiars of Perth and Stir-
ling shires is given, among the general tables, in the appen-
dix.

   Wages.-The wages for all kinds of work may be rec-
koned good.  A principal man-servant, for farming work,
gets at present from L. 10 to L. 12; an inferior one from
L. 8 to L. 10; a woman-servant from L. 3 to L. 5, besides
bed, board, and washing.  The labourers, in time of har-
vest, are of three classes; the first are hired for the whole
time of harvest; the men receive L. 2, the women L. 1, 4 s.
day, a man at 1 s. a woman at 9 d. with victuals; the third
class are paid by the hour, a man 2 d. a woman 1 1/2 d.  This
