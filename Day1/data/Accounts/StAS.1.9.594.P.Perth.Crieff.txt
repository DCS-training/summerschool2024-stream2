yards laid, amounting to 106 from the loom. Each
piece bringd the workman a guinea, and was finished by
him in 24 days, till the introduction of the fly-stuttle in
1791, by which contrivance the fame work is done in 14
days. This cloth is all sent to Glasgow, where it is whi-
tened and printed. In 1790. only 2078 yards, but in 1792,
14,777 yards were wrought and stamped in Crieff, and
might be sold brown at 1 s. the yard. Of late a few
hands are employed in weaving cotton cloth. The 
pieces are generally 130 yards, bring L. 2. each to the
workman, and five guineas more to the owner.  The ex-
prots are, coarse linen, pack-sheeting, sacking, worsted
sluffs, druggets, tanned leather, paper, lintseed-oil, linen
and cotton yarn, and some cotton cloth; besides L. 7400,
in cash or bills to England.  The imports are, black
cattle and sheep for slaughter, butter, cheese, meal,

*When the quality is specified, it means in 1972.  Above 20 times
more tea is used now than 20 years ago.  Bewitched by the mollifying
influence of an enseebling potion, the very poorest class begin to regard
it as one of the necessaries of life, and for its sake resigs the cheaper and
more invigorating nourishment which the productions of their country
afford.  The change in the mode of living, in this and some other re-
spects, had perhaps produced a change in the nature of diseases.  The
acute fever, that 30 years ago often attacked the careless and robust
and came to a crisis in 10 days, is now rarely seen; but to it have
succeeded bysterics diseases flowing from debility and relaxation, and
the flow nervous fever, under which the patient languishes for three or
six months, and probably never again recovers his wanted vigour.  Here,
however, the people in general perhaps as healthy as in any part of
Britain.
