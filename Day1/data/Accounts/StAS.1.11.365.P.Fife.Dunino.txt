pital of their funds to 120 L.; which is lodged partly in the
hands of a landed proprietor, partly in some of the Banks,
and draws interest, commonly at 4 1/2 per cent. per annum.
This, with the weekly collections at church, which are about
2 s. each Sabbath, at an average, and the dues arising from the
two palls, (the one of which produces 5 s. and the other 1 s.

annual income of the poor to about 12 L.  Each of the poor
has nearly 7 1/2 d. every week; but their pensions are propor-

the beadle's, the presbytery clerk's, ect.  ect.; with various
repairs about the church, the school, and school-house; and even

only in such cases as they judge unworthy of an application
to the heritors of the parish.  But, at any rate, those who
have their salaries as above, paid from the poor's funds,
are perhaps equally necessitous with those for whom they
were originally destined.  Upwards of 15 L. was expended
lately in the purchase of a new pall, without touching the
poor's capital.

   Antiquities, ect.-It is affirmed, that there are some relics
of antiquity in the parish, but they happen to exist more in

stood in the vicinity of a place called Balketbly; from which,
(in the opinion that Baal, the Sidonian deity, and the God
of Fezebel, was worshipped there), it is asserted to have de-
rived its name.  Of this Druidical temple not the most smallest
