ties: and thriving forests are now waving, where forty years ago
there was nothing, but heath and marshes.  The state of agricul-
ture has greatly advanced, although it is an indubitable fact that
the land might be rendered still  more producthvd by a more
thorough draining and fencing.  The treatment of the estate of
ldvies in the west end of the  parish has proved this to a demon-
stration.
	Shelter is especially wanted in the centre of the parish, and
were the fields regularly enclosed with hedge-rows, and forest
trees planted, they would prove of signal benefit to the land.
When the last Statistical report was written, there were compa-
ratively few manufacturing operatives in this parish.  The large
village of Friockheim has since sprung up, and is almost entirely
occupied by weavers and, mill-spinners.
	That agriculture and manufactures have greatly progressed can-
not be denied, but whether the permanent position which the lat-
ter now occupies has redounded to the worat and  religious well-
being of the district, may be justly questioned.
