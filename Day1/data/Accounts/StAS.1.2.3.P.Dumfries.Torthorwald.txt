     of Torthorwald.

   Oak, fir, birch, and hazel-trees, the latter with nuts and husks,
are frequently dug up in many parts of the moss:  Several of
these trees are very large and fresh, and are applied by car-
penters to various purposes of their trade.  Fragments of the
firs are cut in small pieces, and used for kindling fires; they
burn amazingly, and are frequently carried to Dumfries for
that purpose.  This moss is bounded on the east by four pa-
rishes, Tinwald, Torthorwald, Mouswald, and Ruthwald, all
terminating in wald, which in the Saxon signifies a wood.
It is tract of above 12 miles in length, generally fine land,
about 2 miles broad, of a gentle western exposure, which
must, from its good properties, have been early cultivated,
and indeed it is reported to have been antiently the place of
the greatest resort in the country.

   Climate and Diseases.-From 1764 to 1790, a period of 27
years, 135 males, and 145 females, in all 280 individuals,
have died in this parish, 54 of whom were between 70 and 80,
and 46 above 80 years of age, so that the climate, it should
seem, is very healthy, and favourable to longevity.  In re-
gard to the prevailing distempers, that will best appear from
the tables of mortality, during the period above-mentioned, to
be inserted in the appendix.

   Proprietors, etc.-There are only two heritors, the Duke of
Queensberry, and Sir Robert Grierson, of Lag, neither of
whom reside.  The rental of the parish in 1756, was
L. 610: 8: 8; in 1790 it amounted to L. 1357; and in
1791 rose to L. 1850.  The best cross land sets at 21 s. 22 s.
and 23 s. per acre, sometimes more; the second best at 15 s.
the third best at 10 s.  The rent of a common house is not a-
bove 10 s. at an average; but then the tenants are bound to
