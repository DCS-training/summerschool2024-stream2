cially that are calculated for a residence to an industrious
and poor family, and which consist only of a house, and
one or more acres of land.  Accordingly, while the village 
acres about Liff and Bervie, upwards of 4 miles from mar-
ket, pay a rent of L. 2 a-year, those of far inferior quali-
ty in Locheye and Milehouse, (so called to mark the di-
stance from Dundee), originally feued between 1735 and
1740 at 10 s. an acre, yielded some years ago L. 3 feu-duty;
and in one place adjoining the late turnpike-road, they now
give L. 5 or L. 6.  As the same line of road passes through
the less inhabited quarter of this district on the north, a
considerable tract of ground in the the strath or valley mention-
ed there, which, for the most part, is now rated only at a-
bout 10 s. the acre, may be expected in time to rise in
value.  The situation is precisely similar to that of Loch-
eye, but farther removed from market, and the land in
general seems more susceptible of improvement and culti-
vation.

   The method of cropping must needs be supposed to va-
ry according to the difference of soil and exposure; but
even where these are the same, one fixed and uniform ro-
tation is not yet adopted.  On one or two farms, where a
regular mode of cultivation is going forward, the sucession
of crops is as follows; 1ft, Oats; 2 d, Fallow; 3 d, Wheat;
4th, Turnip and potatoes; 5th, Barley, with grass-seeds;
and, lastly, two years grass, cut the first year and pastured
the next.  Lint and pease make sometimes a part of the
green crop, but, in general, not much of either is sown.  In
the lighter soil, whereof a large porporion of this district
is composed, both fallow and wheat are often laid down.
Marl is sometimes employed as a manure from the neigh-
bouring parish of Foulis, especially in the higher grounds
