   Two residing heritors, farmers, feuars, small te-
ants, and a few females, householders, make
up the remainder, amounting to about               68

Marriages, on an average of 6 years, ending January
1792, according to the record of the kirk-session, amount-
ed to 15; baptisms to 58; and burials to 29.  In cases
of marriage here, it often happens, that the man is far
less advanced in life than the woman he marries.  The for-
mer depends much on the experience of the latter, and
generally too on the savings of her industry, to enable him
to begin with some comfort a married life:  This disparity
of years happening on the side of the woman, must needs
be a hinderance ot population*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The register of baptism especially in so populous a district as this,
is not to be considered as giving an accurate account of the births in it.
