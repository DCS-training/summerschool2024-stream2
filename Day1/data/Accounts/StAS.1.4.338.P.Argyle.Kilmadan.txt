a mile broad.  It is bounded by Kilfinnan, Inverchallen,
Dunoon, and Strachur.  The parish is almost a flat, bounded
by hills, covered mostly with heath.  The air is moist, the
soil deep and fertile.  The extent of the sea-coast is about
3 miles; the shore is sandy and flat for the most part.  God,
haddocks, syths, mackrel, and herring, are caught on the
coast.  The herring are sold at 1 s. the hundred, when plen-
tiful; they were sent sometime to Rothesay, Greenock,
and Glasgow; they are best in August.  Muffels are the 
only shell-fish here; and wreck, the only sea-weed manure.
Little kelp is made.  The tide ebbs between Bute and
Kerry.  The only bay is at the mouth of Ruail, very 
shallow and sandy, and ebbs out 2 miles.
