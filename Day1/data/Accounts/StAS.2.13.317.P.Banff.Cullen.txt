   where else within the parish.  About half a mile to the westward,
   two patches of the new red or stratified sandstone, appear reposing,
   in a horizontal. position, on the disrupted edges of the greywacke.
   The upper or diluvial beds are shingle, clay, &c.  Near Tochie-
   neal Cottage, at the southern boundary of the parish, there is air
   extensive bed of fine lias clay, containing ammonites, belemnites,
   and other petrifactions common to the lias formation, and which
   can be traced over a considerable portion of the southern part of
   the parish.  This clay having been by the plough mixed with the
   vegetable mould, has rendered the soil uncommonly productive.
   No erratic or rolled blocks have been seen, either in the interior
   of the parish, or along its shores, different from the rocks in situ;
   nor, with the above-mentioned exception, have any petrifactions
   or veins of metal been ever found.
      Botany.-The parish of Cullen, throughout its ecclesiastical
   extent, possesses a highly interesting and most extensive Flora.
   With variety of soil and exposure, it comprehends hill and dale,
   wood, water, and sea coast.  It is matter of regret, however, that
   this interesting field for botanical research has never, to the know-
   ledge of the writer, been examined with that industry and atten-
   tion which it so well deserves, and seldom, indeed at all, save by
   the passing stranger.  Yet, notwithstanding - this desideratum,
   the writer is enabled to notice several plants comparatively rare
   in the district.  Subjoined also are the names of some of the more
   common, which are particularly remarkable for luxuriance of
   growth, and beauty of flower. Along the sloping sides of the
   Bin hill, many alpine plants are to be found, among which may be
   noticed:

   Anemone apennina        Vaccinium vitis-idea        Rubus chamemorus.
   Hyacinthus non-scriptus            myrtillus
   Vaccinium oxycoccos     Oxalis acetosella

	Towards the base of the Bin hill, and in the lower grounds, are
   found:

   Adoxa mosebatellina      Circea alpina               Juniperus communis
   Alnus glutinosa          Digitalis purpurea          Lamium album
   Borago officinalis       Geranium pratenae           Trientalis Europea
   Campanula latifolia      Iris pseudacorus

    Along the coast and sea shore are found:

   Carex arenaria            Laminaria digitata          Porphyra laciniata
   Fucus esculentus          Laurentia pinnatifida       Rhodomenia palmata
   Helianthemum vulgare      Plantago coronopus          Salsola kali.
