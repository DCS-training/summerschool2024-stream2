than 1500 bolls at least, (and that used with the greater
oeconomy, as an addition to what may remain of the pro-
duce here), will serve the whole parish, which the narrator
believes to contain 3000 souls.  The people residing on
the height, though by far the fewer, will consume more
victual, in proportion to their number, than those of the
low coast will use; and this by reason of the more or less
supply of fish from the sea contiguous to them, which the
inhabitants of the height can have no advantage by.

   Price of Victual and Provisions:-The price of victual
has of late years risen very much.  About twenty years
ago, the writer of this account has known the boll of
victual sold for 8 s. Sterling; a live wedder at 5 s.; the
stone of butter, equal to 24 lb.  English weight, sold at 6 s.
Cheese per stone, at 2 s. 6 d. sometimes at 3 s.; a good fat
Highland cow at L. 1, 15 s. or thereby; but now the case is
very much reversed.  The victual now-a-days draws here,
communibus annis, L. 1 Sterling at least per boll, if import-
ed, expence, etc. included.  If carried from the county of
Sutherland, or that of Ross, in this case, servant, horses
and harness, with tear and wear, must be prepared, and will
be either five or fix days betwixt going and returning.  At
this very day shepherds draw from 13 s. to 15 s. for a good
wedder.  The butter fetches 10 s. per stone; cheese per
stone 4 s. and sometimes 5 s.  The price of black cattle is
very changeable here, as already hinted at in the preceding
page, and the reason for it is the instability of droving.
Further, it may be easily observed and admitted, that the
multiplicity of licensed stills in the low corn-countries.
