sheep, indeed, yield a larger quantity, but it is coarse, strong,
and shaggy; the sheep which were in the country formerly,
bad thick short wool, remarkably sine in the pile.  At pre-
sent about seven sleeces go to the stone; there are upwards
of 3000 stones sold annually in this parish.  The greatest 
part of which, for some years past, has been sold to the pro-
prietors of a very extensive woollen manufactory, between
Glasgow and Dumbarton, and conveyed there by water at
the expence of the purchasers.  The price of the white
wool is 7 s. and 6s. 6 d. when there is a fourth part of it
laid; it is usual to give a stone to the score.  Though all the
wool in this parish brings the same price, it is not all nearly
of the same value; the buyers are sensible of this, and when
they get well acquainted with the wool of the different
farms, it is hoped they will make a distinction, as nothing
tends more to discourage the improvement of wool, than
giving the same price for the good and the bad.
