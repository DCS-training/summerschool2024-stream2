The schoolmaster's salary is 200 merks; the number of
scholars generally about 40.  English and writing are
taught for 1 s. 6 d. the quarter:  arithmetic and Latin, for
2 s. 6 d.  The emoluments of session-clerkship may be a-
bout L. 4 or L. 5 Sterling, yearly.

   Price of Labour and Provisions.-The wages of a day-
labourer in husbandry are 1 s. without victuals, and 8 d. with
them.  A male labouring servant's wages are from L. 5 to
L. 8 a year; a female's, L. 3; a good labouring married
servant receives as wages about L. 6 Sterling in money, a
house and yard, the value of which is between 20 s. and
30 s.; he gets a cow maintained through the year, and his
fuel brought home:  All which generally enable him to
bring up a family.  A carpenter's wages are 10 d. or 1 s.

or 7 s. the stone.

and pease are sown in March and April; barley in April
and the beginning of May; and wheat generally in Sep-
tember and October.  The greatest part of the land is
inclosed; the people being convicted of the advantage of
inclosing.  The loch of Balgavies has, for many years, fur-
nished much marl for manure.  The rent of the best ara-
ble land may be about L. 1 the acre; but what the farmers
chiefly study is the bringing up of black cattle.  The land
