a handsome modern house at his place of Conanside, in the
west end of the parish, where he resides a part of the year.
Situated on the banks of the river Conan, this place pos-
sesses many natural beauties; and it has of late been much
improved by art.  There are plantations of firs on this e-
state, of considerable extent.  Some of them are intermix-
ed with forest trees, and all of them in a thriving condi-
tion.  Where dismal bleakness lately prevailed, the eye is
now presented with refreshing verdure.

   Population.-The population of this parish, as appears
from the following statements, has been very variable
Occasional chasms in the old registers, are partly the cause
of selecting the particular periods in the subsequent ta-
ble of births and marriages.  No register of deaths has
been kept in this parish; or could the number be so ea-
sily ascertained as in many other parishes, there being two
burial places.
