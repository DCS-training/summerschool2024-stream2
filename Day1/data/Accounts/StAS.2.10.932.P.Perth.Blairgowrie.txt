of the practice, now so generally adopted by Scottish land-
owners, of throwing several small farms into one,--a practice which
has had the effect of transferring the agriculture of the parish to
a body of men possessed of superior intelligence, and such a com-
mand of capital, as enables them to conduct it on a liberal scale,
and on the most approved principles. The result has been a vast
improvement in the whole system of agricultural lanagement,
and, consequently, in the general aspect of the country, since
the publication of the last Statistical Account. Then nearly
two-thirds of the parish lay quite open and unenclosed: Al-
most every field was intersected in many places by stripes of
waste ground, called "baulks," on which the stones gathered from
the ground under crop were deposited: there were no drains to
carry off the superfluous water, and no plantations to shelter the
fields from the cold and blighting winds: a proper system or ro-
tation of cropping was almost unknown, and a great extent of
ground remained wholly waste and unproductive, or yielded but
a scanty pasturage for cattle during the summer months.  Now
almost every farm is properly subdivided and enclosed; the
"baulks" have been all removed; the wet ground has been drain-
ed; and many plantations formed for shelter to the more exposed
grounds. A proper rotation of cropping and manuring has been
introduced; and the greater part of the waste ground has been
either reclaimed and cultivated, or covered with thriving wood.
Nor is the improvement in the domestic economy of the farmer
less marked. Instead of the miserable thatched hovel,--dark,
dirty, confined, and withal ill furnished,--in which he formerly
contrived to exist--he now inhabits a good substantial slated house,
well-lighted, clean, commodious, and comfortably furnished.  In-
stead of the ill-fashioned garments, of coarse home-spun materials,
which be formerly wore, he is clad in well-fitting clothes of good
broad-cloth; and the hat of modern shape has taken the place of
the broad blue bonnet of former days. The change in the whole
style of his "house-keeping" is equally observable; and, without
entering into a minute detail on this subject, it may suffice to re-
mark, that the habitual style of living which now prevails among
this class marks the acquisition not only of new tastes and refined
habits, but of the means of gratifying them; and, however opinions
may differ on the question, whether this change may not have been
carried farther than their station and circumstances warrant, the
