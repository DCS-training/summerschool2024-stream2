ther inclining to the N. side of the hill, there is a circular or
elliptical inclosure, about 360 feet in circumference, which,
it would appear, had been a small Roman encampment.
By most of the historians, and by the editors of Camden's
Antiquities, it is mentioned as a place of this kind.  There
are not wanting, in this neighbourhood, similar military
stations of the Romans.  As they appear to have been too
small, for ordinary encampment, it is probable, that they
were the castra exploratorum, or stations for centinels.  In
this respect, the place here mentioned, is extremely suita-
ble.  From it, an extensive view of the counties of Dum-
barton and Argyle, which were beyond the limits of the
Roman province, presents itself to the eye.  Here then,

movements of our rude ancestors, and take measures to re-
pel their irruptions.  By the common people in this coun-
try, the place is called Queen Mary's camp.  But, it is
well known, that no encampment was made by either
party, in this more recent period of history.  Murray, the
regent, having drawn his forces from Glasgow, on the
same day in which the engagement happened, made a
stand here, in order to intercept the Queen, in her progress
to Dumbarton, when a skirmish ensued; the Queen's par-
ty was routed, and a considerable number of her friends
killed; but many more were taken prisoners in the pur-
suit.  A place is yet pointed out, upon an opposite emi-
nence, fully in the view of the field now described, and
near the old castle of Cathcart*, where Mary stood until

*The castle of Cathcart is now a ruin.  From its remains, it appears
to have been a very strong building.  It stands upon one of the most 
commanding situations in the country, and has two of its sides complete-
ly defended by the Cart, to which there is almost a perpendicular descent
of a tremendous height.  The access to it on the other side, except by
