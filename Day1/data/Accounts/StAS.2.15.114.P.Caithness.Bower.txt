                  PRESBYTERY OF CAITHNESS, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND
                                  CAITHNESS.

                            _______________________

                        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
               Name, &c.-THE name of the parish is supposed to be derived
            from a Danish word signifying a valley. Its extent is 7 miles in
            length and 3 in breadth.
                                  II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
               State of Property and Antiquities,&c.-The boundary of the
            parish was formerly, in the greater part of its extent, the boundary
            of distinct properties.
               The estates of Tister (formerly written Thuspisteer,) and
            Northfield, in this parish, connected with Durran, in the parish
            of Olrick, had belonged to the family of Mr Sinclair Worth of
            Durran.  Both of these estates are now the property of the Earl
            of Caithness.
               The property of Lyth, in this parish, separated by a burn only
            from How and Myreland, in the parish of Wick, belongs to Mr Sin-
            clair of Barrack.  That of Bowermaddon, and half of Mursay,
            in this parish, have been added to Tain and Hoy, in tbeparish of
            Olrick.
               The boundary of Bowermaddon and Mursay was supposed to
            extend to the burn of Amatan; and the intervening house and
            farm of Hartfield is partly in this parish, and partly in that of
            Dunnet.  The mills on these two last have been pulled down,
            and a new one erected in place of them, on the boundary of
            Bowemaddon.
              The estate of Scarmclet, on the south-west side of this parish
            has been acquired by Sir R. Anstruther, and added to his property
            of Dunn, in the parish of Watten, and improved by a new farm
            at Blackcarn, beyond Larel, and a steading of buildings at Bleedy-
            quoy, and the erection of an excellent new mill.  On the pre-
            mises on which the old mill stood, Sir Ralph Anstruther has
            caused a school-house to the built.
