   Roads, Bridges, &c.-There are two, or rather three pu-
blic roads, leading through the united parish.  Besides these,
are sundry private or by-roads.  Till a year or two
ago, the roads in the parish were made and kept in repair
by statute labour; but by a late act of Parliament, the sta-
tute labour in this county was converted into money.  By
the act, the occupiers of lands, whether proprietors or te-
nants, are liable to pay yearly, an assessment in money, for
the lands occupied by them respectively, according as the
said lands stand valued in the tax-roll of the county, at a
rate not exceeding the rum of L. 1, 4 s.  Sterling for each
L. 100 Scots of valued rent.  Accordingly in this parish,
now, the landed proprietors being assessed in proportion to
their valued rents, levy the assessment from their tenants
according to the real rents they pay, and they again from
their subtenants; the proprietors, at the same time, being
accountable for what they themselves occupy.  This mode
is deemed rather more favourable to the poorer class of in-
habitants, than the exaction of the statute labour in kind,
but is thought more burdensome on the farmer.  Turn-
pikes are considered as by no means necessary here; and
the erecting of them at present would be rather an unpopu-
lar measure.-With regard to bridges, 2 have been built
this summer in the parish of Logie, chiefly by subscription,
on the road leading from Marykirk to Montrose.  On the
west public road are 2 small bridges, built some years ago.
As to being kept in repair, they are now upon the same
footing with the public roads.  The principal bridge in the
parish, and which connects it with the Mearns, is the
North Water Bridge, consisting of 3 arches, of exceeding
