vices and directions as to the management and improvement of
their farms, with offers of pecuniary assistance, besides premiums
in carts, and tools, and seeds, to encourage and enable them to
carry, on such improvements as might tend to their prosperity ; and
in which, after pointing at some of their prevailing vices, he strongly
recommends and urges on them a virtuos conduct as one great
mean of success, by drawing down a blessing on their endeavours.
Nor did his improvements regard the soil alone.  It was be who
first introduced at Monymusk those improvements in sacred mu-
sic which have since been so generally adopted, having procured
a qualified teacher for the congregation, and taken an active and
leading part among the singers himself; whence this, like his
improvements in agriculture, gradually overcoming the prejudices
of the people, soon made its way through the surrounding country.
His successors have also been found indulgent landlords.
   Lord Cullen's second son, William, was also a distinguished
ornament of the Scottish Bar, and held successively the various
offices of Procurator to the Church, and Principal Clerk to the
General Assembly ; of Solicitor-General, and Lord Advocate;
was raised to the Bench by the title of Lord Prestongrange, and
afterwards became Lord Justice-Clerk.
   Another remarkable character connected with the parish, of
date anterior to the above, was George Lesley, a Capuchin Friar
of the earlier part of the seventeenth century, whose life and mar-
vellous adventures were first published in Italian bv the Arch-
bishop of Fermo, and dramatized at Rome in 1673.  His bio-
grapher represents him as the son of James, Count Lesley, and
Jean Wood, his wife, by whom he was early instructed in the
doctrines of the Reformation, and relates wonderful stories of his
bein miraculously converted to the Roman Catholic faith, while
abroad at his education, on which he assumed the name of Arch-
angel ; of his mother's great grief at the intelligence, and her
disowning of him in bonsequence ; of his returning after many
years to the Castle of Monymusk, leading the people to an ad-
joining mountain, and converting thousands of them to the true
faith, and at last the old lady herself, with the other members of
the family, and the whole establishment of the castle; with many
other marvellous deeds and adventures, more like romance than
true history.
   The only other eminent character of whom the parish bas to
boast as a native, is the late Rev. Dr Alexander Nicoll, canon of
                                    4
