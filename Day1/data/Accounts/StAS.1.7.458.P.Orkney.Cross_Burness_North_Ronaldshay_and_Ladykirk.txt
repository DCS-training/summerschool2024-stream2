and good anchoring ground.  There are several nesses or
points, as may be seen by Mr Murdoch M'Kenzie's map.
The most remarkable are Spurness, on the south-west; Els-
ness, Beaness, and Tressness, on the south; the Start and
Toftness on the east, and the Holmes of Eyre on the north
side.  The two anchoring places in the isle of North Ronald-

Thus it appears, that from 1773, to the present 1790, both in-
clusive, that is 18 years, there have been wrecked on these
islands 2830 tons British, value 75,500 L.-700 tons Dutch, va-
lue 10,000 L.-950 tons Danish, value 20,000 L.-and 400 tons
Dantzick property, value 4000 L.-In all nearly 5000 tons, and
above 100,000 L. value.  It is true, that many of these vessels
were got off and repaired, and the cargoes partly saved; but
when the expence attending this is considered, and the check it
gives to the spirit of commerce, and the low prices the damaged
goods bring, it is affirmed by some, that it would be for the in-
terest of the concerns if the whole was totally wrecked.  If ac-
count had been kept of the wrecks in former years, it would, it
is believed, have equalled the above in the number, and sur-
passed it in the value lost.  In 1740, the Suaecia East Indiaman
of Sweden, was totally lost on the shoal of Reep-dyke, on the
cast side of North Ronaldshay.  Her cargo was supposed to be
the most valuable ever shipped for Sweden, and, it is said, cost
at Bengal 150,000 L. Sterling; in consequence of which loss, the
affairs of the Swedish East India Company were greatly embar-
rassed.  I think it was about the year 1760, the Crown Prince
of Denmark, East Indiaman, outward bound, was wrecked on
North Ronaldshay, with 60 chests of silver aboard.  The money
was saved.  If the cargo of the Suaecia East Indiaman was esti-
mated at its value in Europe, it would appear, that there has
been wrecked on these two islands, even within half a century,
property to the amount of at least half a million Sterling.  The
interests of commerce therefore required, that the government
should, as they have now done, erect a light-house on one of
these islands.
