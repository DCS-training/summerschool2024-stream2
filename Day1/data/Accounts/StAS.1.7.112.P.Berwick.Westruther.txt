free-stone bottom.  This earth, where it has been long in
cultivation,  and often dunged, has become a rich loam, and
is excellent for every species of crop that is adapted to the
climate.  Where this reddish soil is not so deep and strong,
it is inclined to be sharp and gravelly.  This also is very fit
for cropping, and particularly is well suited to the turnip

turnpike-roads, by which there is easier access to manure;
and the product of the land is carried to market at less ex-

adopted for correcting an evil that has long been felt and
complained of.  When by this means the interecourse be-

   Among the improvements in husbandry that have beers in-

raising of turnips and broad slover.  As the turnips, from the
