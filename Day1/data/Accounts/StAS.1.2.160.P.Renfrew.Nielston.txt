     Statistical Account

   The heritors are called once every year to audit, and pass
the Session's accounts, and examine the securities for the mo-
ney lent.  At these meetings it has been recommended to
them, especially to the non-residing heritors, to prevent far-
ther encroachments upon the capital of the parish funds, by
their making up any annual deficiency, (which hitherto has
been but trisling,) according to their respective valuations;
or by sending a voluntary donation yearly to the poor, in some
kind of proportion to their respective properties; and, to conti-
nue this mode, without assessing the people, while they conti-
nue to give liberally.  Assessments indeed, never fail to coun-
teract charity; and were the people to be once assessed, they
would probably with-hold their collections altogether.  It does
not appear, however, with the exception of about two heri-
tors, that this representation  has hitherto produced any effect.
In this parish, the non-residing heritors, probably hold three
fourths of the surface, and may, perhaps draw, the same pro-
portion, of the whole rent.  It is said, that in some parts of
Scotland, there are instances of non-residing heritors receiving
almost the whole rents of several parishes, and yet, in some of
them, that they have never contributed a farthing to the sup-
port of the poor.  Equity, justice, humanity, common sense itself,
lift up their united voice, against so disgraceful a circumstance, is
true; nor it is any wonder, that in such districts, the discerning
part of the inhabitants look forward with pleasure to a coming
day, when this "with-holding more than is meet," nay, with-
holding every thing, may be counterated, and when those in the
middle and interior ranks of life, shall no longer have the sole
burden imposed upon them.
