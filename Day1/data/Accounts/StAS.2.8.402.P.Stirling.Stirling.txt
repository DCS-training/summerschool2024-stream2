the Forth near Kildean, in the immediate vicinity of the scene
of the conflict, which, seven years before, had proved so disas-
trous to his forces.  He was, however, baffled in his design on
the castle, which, notwithstanding the defection and treason of
Comyn, boldly held out.  But, being determined to obtain posses-
sion of a place so important to his interest, he laid siege to it with
all the force he could employ; with all the resources be could
command, even to the despoiling of the church of the lead that
covered it; and with such ardour as often to expose his own per-
son in the assault; but with a spirit withal so unbecoming a brave
monarch, who ought to have honoured, if not the indomitable pa-
triotism of a resolute defender of his country, at least the fidelity
and courage of a magnanimous foe, that, when, after the most in-
defatigable efforts, met with the most obstinate resistance, he at
length succeeded in conquering all opposition, he refused a capi-
tulation to the garrison, and sent Oliphant to the Tower of Lon-
don.  The castle remained, after this, in the hands of the English
for ten years.  Early in 1314 it was invested by Edward Bruce,
the gallant brother of the renowned King Robert, who prosecut-

for the second Edward of England, agreed to surrender, should
be not be relieved on or before the 24th of June.
  Robert, who had been crowned in 1306, and with various suc-

though much dissatisfied with such a covenant, had nevertheless
given his sanction to the truce.  Meanwhile the greatest host
which had ever entered the country, having been marcbed north-
ward by Edward II., for the relief of the contested fortress, ar-
rived in the immediate neighbourhood of Stirling, where it was met
and intercepted by Bruce at the head of his small, but brave, band
of patriots. On the 23d of June, a fine body of 800 English caval-
ry was pushed forward, but in a circuitous direction, so as to pass
round the flank of the Scottish army, to attack and dislodge the
besiegers. Bending eastward by the low grounds on the edge of
the carse, they succeeded in eluding observation until they had
actually passed the left flank of  the Scots,--when, being discover-
ed, they were pursued by Randolph, Earl of Moray, with 500
horse, who intercepted their attack, and, assailing them on the
ground now occupied partly by the modern suburb of Stirling,
called Southfield, and the villas of South Lodge and Randolph,
Feld in the parish of Stirling, and partly by the northern end of
