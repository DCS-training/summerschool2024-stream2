much like the surface of a fir top.  Besides these, there are
likewise longitudinal seams from end to end, resembling the
trunk of an old yew, or thorn tree.  It is unnecessary to say,
that the circumjacent case bears a similar impression, only
reversed.  But it deserves to be mentioned, that within the
same trunk, and at different angles, there lie a variety of
smaller ones, from two to three inches diameter.  These are
seldom parallel to one another, and cannot be extracted
without destroying the large trunk; but when extracted, they
shew beautiful impressions; finer by much than the larger
trunk.  These sometimes branch out into regular ramifica-
tions at top, as they almost always do at bottom; and the
smaller the branch the finer and more delicate the impres-
sions upon its surface; in so much, that the smallest will
bear and almost require to be examined by the microscope.
I gave one of them lately to a gentleman, who promised to
send it to Weir's museum.
   It is unnecessary to add, for I believe it is a common thing,
that there are uniformly vegetable impressions along the base
of the coal and surface of the dalk or blaes.  These are so
endlessly varied, that I cannot pretend, nor would it be pro-
per to attempt an enumeration of them.

   Coal.-The only article that remains to be mentioned, is the
coal.  This has been wrought for ages; and is still abundant, I
trust inexhaustible.  The seams are various, and of very different
quality.  The coal in the west barony, is one of the best I
ever saw.  It burns clear, lasts long, gives a good heat, and
cakes, so that the very dross of it is valuable; and makes a
better fire than most other coals.  Happily for us this seam is
now wrought to a considerable extent, and promises to be a
lasting benefit to this parish and the neighbourhood.  Robert
