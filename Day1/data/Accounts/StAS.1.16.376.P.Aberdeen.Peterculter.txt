     Statistical Account

much ascent and descent, in so quick succession, and in a
space of so few miles, can scarce be met with in any other
road.  Some gentlemen in the neighbourhood, sensible of
this inconvenience, have thought of planning out another
road, in a shorter line and a more level tract.  But the ex-
ecution will be laborious and expensive, and to raise a suf-

the road.  I am of opinion, that the farmers would readily
apply their gleanings in that manner, if any gentleman,
who takes a concern in the public roads, would express a
wish for its being done.
   There are two arched stone-bridges in this parish.  One
of them is over Leuchar-burn, near its junction with Gor-
mack-burn, on the road leading from Aberdeen to part of
Cromar, etc.  It is in bad repair.  A part of the battle-
ments or parapet is fallen dawn; so that a beast and cart
