     Statistical Account

telligent people here confidently assert, that these weights
have increased much of late; and others as strenuously con-
tend, that they are the same now they were many years ago;
but almost all except a few ignorant or interested men are a-
greed, that they are very fallacious.  Though this be an evil
of no inconsiderable magnitude, the people must it seems en-
dure it; for no permanent and effectual remedy can be ap-
plied without the interposition of the legislature.
   Before any reasonable expectation of improving the condi-
tion of the people can be entertained, more just weight, must
be introduced; the leases of land, which are at present far
too short must be lengthened double or treble at least; all
the tack and feu-duties must be converted into money; bet-
ter feed must be sown, and that changed annually; and the
barbarous feudal customs, of grassums and services totally abo-
lished.  In order to have a number of spare hands for the
purpose of manufactures and fisheries, several of the farms,
which are at present by much too small, must be thrown in-
to one; and were this circumstance to be attended to, it
would induce men of some stock or substance to rent them.
   Even in the town the people labour under several incon-
veniences.  All the intelligence of any importance which
they have, must come from the south, and it is often very
slow in reaching them.  This, indeed, happens partly from
the boisterous friths which the post must unavoidably cross
in his way to Kirkwall.  But notwithstanding this circum-
stance, were the post to go out on Friday instead of Sunday;
were he to ride through Caithness and Sutherland where he
now walks; were he to come straight from Wick to Houna,
or should he still continue to come by Thurso; were he to
cross the Pentland Frith from Scarfscarry to Walls, in place
of coming by South Ronaldshay, they might have the return
of a letter in one third less time than it now takes to come
