that district of Ayrshire, called Kyle, in the presbytery of
Ayr, and in the Synod of Glasgow and Ayr.  Near the
church and manse it is hilly.  One may walk, in the short
space of 5 minutes, from the manse to the top of one of the
neighbouring hills, which, though not perhaps mmore than
500 feet above the level of the sea, yet commands a most
extensive and delightful prospect.  It may be safely said, that,
above 100 square miles of rich land may be seen; and that
in all that extent, almost every nobleman, and gentleman's 
seat, every town and village, every garden and wood, ap-
pear distinctly.  Here also are beheld the venerable Ben-
lomond, and several of the other Grampian hills,-the frith
of Clyde flowing beautifully to the ocean;-the ridges
in the Isle of Jura,-the lofty tops of Arran, and the maje-
stic rock of Ailsa, beyond which the hills of Ireland seem to
rise from the sea.-The soil in general is rather light and
gravelly.  Some parts of it consist of a thin poor clay, but
there are many fields of a deep strong clay, which, when
properly cultivated, produce, in favourable seasons, very
rich crops.  The greatest part of the parish is arable, and
enclosed with hedge and ditch, but some parks are surround-
ed with stone dikes.  There are likewise some good fields of
meadow ground.  The hills are covered with verdure, and
afford excellent pasture for cattle.

   Minerals.-Many parts of this parish contain coal,
though only one pit is at present wrought.  In some pla-
ces which were wrought not long ago, two seams were
found; the one a hard and lasting, and the other a light, or
what is called a candle coal.  When these were burnt to-
gether, they made an excellent fire.  There are also 2 or 3
great lime-works, whole distance from coal is not above 2
English miles.  About 60,000 bolls of lime may be raised
annually.  The profit thence arising mush be considerable,
