     NUMBER XLIX.

     PARISH OF ROSSKEEN.

     (COUNTY OF ROSS.)

     By the Rev. MR. URQUHART.

     Origin of Name, Situation, etc.

   THE parish or Rosskeen does not furnish much room for
statistical investigation.-The name seems to be
derived from the Gaelic word Coinnea, signifying a meeting
or junction, and Ross-coinnea may denote the place, where the
districts of Easter and Wester Ross join, (which is at the west-
er boundary of this parish,) and where the inhabitants might
occasionally assemble.  It is centrical in point of distance betwixt
the two royal burghs of Tain and Dingwal.-The parish be-
longs to the presbytery of Tain, and synod of Ross.-
Its extent, so far as it is inhabited, may be from the shore to
the hills, about 10 measured miles, and its average breadth
about 6.

   Surface and Soil.-The lower part of the parish, which
extends along the firth of Cromarty, and for 2 miles back,
lies on a gentle and easy ascent to the bottom of the first hills.
The soil varies, being partly gravelly and light, partly loam;
