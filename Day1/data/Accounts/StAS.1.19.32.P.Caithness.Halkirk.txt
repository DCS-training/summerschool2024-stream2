that their utter decay, and not attempting to grow since, is
owing to such a revolution of climate and soil as took place
at that period?  And what makes for this still further, and
adds to the probability of it, is another circumstance, viz.
the seasons are colder, the earth more wet, the crops not
near so good, some animals, such as the wild bee, the swal-
low, scarcely to be seen since that fatal period; and not
only so, some vegetables that answered very well before,
do not grow now at all with the greatest attention and in-
dustry.
   I would also further remark, as it now occurs to me, and
applies to the present purpose, that when there is a current
of air from the sea, accompanied with mist and fog, it en-
velopes all the vegetable creation as far as it advances with
a slimy, saline kind of dew, which is often from one end
of the country to the other; for I believe there is no place
in this country, that is above 9 miles in a straight line from
the sea, which surrounds it close on every quarter but the
S. and S.W.  This dew, when applied to the tongue and
palate, has a very saltish relish; so I have experienced once
in the centre of the country; nay, at that time, and in that
place, I felt the scent of rotten ware, as sensibly almost as
if I had been on the shore at that time.  This circumstance
must surely have a considerable influence on trees, and the
other produce of the soil, and this is the cause of my ma-
king this remark.  But before I close these observations,
I would further remark, that our winters are in proportion
more temperate than the other seasons of the year.  Whe-
ther this has been the case of old I cannot say.
