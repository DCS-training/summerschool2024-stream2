principal ones belonging to the city are on small islands a short
way down the river. The whole belonging to the city are let for
about L.830. Last lease, they were let for L. 1300; ten years ago
the rent was L. 1500. All the fish taken in the river above New-
burgh are shipped from Perth by lighters for the Dundee steam
ships, in which they are conveyed to London. The number
shipped in 1835 was above 25,000 salmon and 50,000 grilses,
making 5000 boxes, or 250 tons of fish. The yearly average of
ten years, however, might be only about 4500 boxes, or 225 tons
The rental of the whole fishings of the district will rate between
L. 8000 and L. 10,000, and employ upwards of 450 men.
   Previous to 1828, the close-time commenced on the 26th of
August, and ended 10th December. It was then altered by act of
Parliament, and commenced 14th September, and ended the 1st
of February. But it has been found that the 14th of Septem-
ber is too late for shutting, as many of the fish far advanced to-
wards spawning are killed between the 26th of August and 14th
of September; and, on the whole, the prolongation of the time has
been of very little benefit to those interested in the matter, while
a great many fish that ought to have been left to stock the river
are destroyed.
   A bill has now been introduced into Parliament to fix the close
time for the Tay, from about the 25th of August to the middle of
January, which has the approbation of all concerned in the Tay fish-
ings. The act of 1828 was, however, productive of several good
effects, especially in affording greater facilities to the punishment
of poachers, and the protection of spawning fish, so that there is
reason to believe that not one is now killed in close-time, for twenty
previous to the passing of that act. Owing to the above and other
causes, grilses have increased very much of late years,--the num-
ber taken being fully sevenfold to what it was forty years ago.
