been built in this parish, opposite to Dumbarton, upon feus
from Mr Denniston of Colgrain; and a village is just now
begun upon the property of Mr Graham of G rmore,
which, it is probable, when the present stagnation of business
is over, will fast increase in population.

   Distillery, Mills, Ferriess, etc.-There is one distillery,
which consumes of the produce of the parish about 500 bolls
of bear and barley.  The number of public houses, or rather
whisky shops, has of late been greatly diminished.  The
Justices have for this year given licence to only two in the
village of Rentoun, to tell spirits of home produce.  There
are three corn mills, at two of which the musture  on the as-
tricted lands, is nearly in the proportion of one peck and an
half the boll, consisting of 8 stones.  This proves a great dis-
couragement to improvement.  There are 4 different ferries,
two of these are of great antiquity, as appears from the char-
ters of the proprietors.  The prices of labour, victuals, etc.
are nearly the same as in Glasgow and its neighbourhood.

   Fisheries.-The Zoir or Yoir  Fishings, so productive in this
parish, seem to be almost pecu  to it.  A yare is built of
stones gathered from the tide water-mark, about 4 feet in
height, and of considerable length, and stretches out into the
river in the form of a crescent, or of three sides of a square;
but to give it a probability of succeeding, it must proceed
from a point of land, so as to inclose a bay.  The distance
which it is extended from there  is such, as to make it
appear, or to crown, as the fishers  term it, about two hours
before low water.  Were it placed farther into the sea, or
built higher, the surf would be continually beating it down.
In spring tides, the water retiring quickly, great quantities
of fish, particularly herrings, are occasionally taken within
