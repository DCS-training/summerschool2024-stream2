ple's feet, with those of the hooves of horses, cows, and
sheep.

   Antiquities.-As the Romans and ancient Caledonians con-
tinued their contests long about the front of the Grampian
hills, we find a vast number of camps, forts, etc. and simi-
lar relics of antiquity.  About 2 miles east from the church,
at the country called Findochs, there is a large camp.  It is
situated opposite to the only proper passage through the hills
found in them, for about 40 miles:  It stands on a high
ground, defended by waters on two sides, and a moss with
steep ground on the others.  The trenches are still entire,
and in some places 6 feet deep.  It is about 180 paces in
length, and 80 paces in breadth, and was surrounded by a
strong earthen wall, part of which still remains, and is near
12 feet thick.  Those who are connoisseurs in such matters,
say it could contain 12,000 men.  Within the camp there is
a large plain, called Rathmore, i. e. fortisication, which, howe-
ver, seems to be of a later date.  Near this there are many
ruins, burrows, cairns of stones, some of which have
been opened, and were found to be graves.  Near this camp
stands a village called, in Gaelic, Fianteach, i. e. FINGAL'S
house++.  Within two miles North from this, stands the
high hill of Dunmore.  On it there is a strong sort, which
had the complete command of the passage through the hills.
This fort incloses the summit of the hill; and is inaccessible

<FOOTNOTE>

++Tradition says, FINGAL'S house stood here until it was burnt by Gara.
Comparing the names of places, and the names of the princes as mentioned
in history, it is probable, this camp was occupied about the year 300.  Tra-
dition says, Fingal dwelt for some time in this country, and we know both his
father and his fun are buried here.  When digging lately among the ruins,
plates of lead, curious bead-stones, dog's collars, etc. were found.
