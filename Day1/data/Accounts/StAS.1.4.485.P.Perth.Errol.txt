in the yard upon clover. Till of late, the breeding of horses
was rather neglected, and large sums were laid out in pur-
chasing to their interest in that respect, and there is a pro-
spect that will henceforth provide for themselves.
But the carse tenants who can go much length in bringing
up young beast of whatever kind, are those who have
grass possession somewhere else, to which they can remove
them at the proper season.  The parish may contain 7000
acres.  The whole of it is arable, and at present under
cultivation in the manner already mentioned, excepting
some inclosure of firs, which, though the trees are
scarcely come to half their size, the proprietors are fast
clearing off. From the different methods pursued by the
farmers for the productions of grain, it cannot be exactly
determined what quantity of land is employed in each
species; but it is conjectured that there is a fifth of the
whole parish in wheat, nearly a sixth in grass, and as much
in peas, something more in fallow, potatoes, flax, plan-
tations, less than sixth in oats, and about the same in
barley.-Land is rented at very different prices. Fifteen
years ago, it was about 15 s. the acre.  It rose immediad-
ly after to L. 1 5 s. and was then judged so high, that the 
tenat obtained his possession for life. It has of late been
letting for L. 2. and some of it even L. 2. 10 s; but
rents of this last kind are given chiefly for lands about the 
village, where trades people pay rather for the conveni-
ence than value of ground.  The valued rent of the parish
is nearly L. 17,000 Scots, and the real rental is said to
about L. 8000 Sterling.  The extent of farms is variable,
but in general from 100 to 200 acres.  The tillage is per-
formed by a plough, with an iron head and mettle mould
board, drawn by 2 horses, which one person manages.
