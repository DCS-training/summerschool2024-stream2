plainly discernible, in the rapid increase of inhabitants and
of new buildings; and bid fair to secure to its industrious and
enterprising citizens, a growing and permanent fund of
wealth and prosperity.

   Little information can be got concerning the manufac-

of plaids was considerable; and though, at that time, a
ropework and soapwork, and a refining of sugar were be-
gun at Glasgow, yet neither these, nor any other manu-
facture seem to have been carried to any great extent, un-
til they began to perceive how advantageously articles of
manufacture could be disposed of, in their commercial in-
tercourse with America.  It was, therefore, in the period
between 1725 and 1750, that the spirit for manufactures
first became prevalent; and thought it has ever since been
increasing in energy, and diffusing its influence, its effects
for a few years past have been wonderful.  The variety of
manufactures now carried on in Glasgow, which have ex-
tended in almost every branch, are very great; but that
