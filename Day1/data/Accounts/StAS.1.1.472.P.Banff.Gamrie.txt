   Mineral Springs, Quarries, etc.-Near the sea-coast, and
in the neighbourhood of Macduff, is a pretty good mineral
spring, called the Well of Farlair, which has been useful in
gravellish complaints.  Of late years it has come into consi-

In this parish, upon the estate of Melrose, now the property
of Lord Fife, is a very good state-quarry.  The quantity an-

quality, of a beautiful blue colour, not inferior to the Easdale
state, only thicker, larger, and make a heavier roof.  Quar-
riers are commonly paid by the piece, which is certainly the
best way for themselves and their employers.  Common day-
labourers usually receive from 7 d. to 9 d. a day in winter, and
from 9 d. to 1 s. in summer.

ties.  1. A perpendicular rock of very great extent, full of
shelves, and possessed by thousands of birds called Kitty-
weaks.  These arrive in the beginning of spring, and leave it
again towards the end of August, after they have brought
sorth their young.  Some people are fond of eating the young
Kity's; but the shooting of them is a favourite diversion e-
very year.  The season for this is commonly the last week
of July.  Whither these birds go in winter is not known;
most probably it is to some place upon the coast of Norway-
