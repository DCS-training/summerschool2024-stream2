     The Statistical Account

you will give me leave to take notice to you of a mistake in
the account of the parish of Ellon, Vol. iii. p. 101, where it
is said that the schoolmaster of Ellon has 100 merks from
the proprietor of Waterton; whereas the fact is, that he has

mistake in the same volume in page 1ft of the contents,
where the parishes of Ellon and Loudoun are placed the one
for the other, and the population of the one stated as the
population of the other.

that there was a district of this parish belonging to Sir W.
Forbes of Craigievar, the inhabitants of which, by reason of
their distance from their own parish church, were annexed
quoad sacra to the church of Leochel, and trader the charge
of the minister of Leochel; and that, as I was then a stran-
ger in the county, and entirely unacquainted with the num-
bers in that district, I referred to the minister of Leochel's
letter for the exact enumeration of them.  The population
of this district, which is called Corse, is very considerable,
