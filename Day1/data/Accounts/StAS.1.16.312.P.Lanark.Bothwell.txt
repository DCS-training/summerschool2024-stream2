all dew and moisture from the root of the plant.  But when
the ground is in pretty good order, and is favoured with
frequent rains, it never fails to produce excellent crops.
This is so remarkable, that the crop about the village of
Bothwell is looked to by the inhabitants of the moorish
part of the country as the index of the season; and when
it is very luxuriant, they consider it as a certain signal that
a greater quantity of rain has fallen, than suits their situa-
tion.
   As a proof of what returns the best soil will yield, these
are attested by credible authors, who both sowed and reaped
the field.  In some places the crop has amounted to 15
bolls of oats per acre; one acre of the glebe produced, 30
years since, 18 bolls of beans; and one in the holms yield-
ed above 20 bolls of wheat, or 80 Winchester bushels.
They were doubtless in high cultivation.
   The grain is of a superior quality.  The conversion at
the mill is little short of meal for oats.  It is purchased for
seed by other parts of the country.  The Scots plough,
upon a lighter plan, with three horses, is generally used.
   There is excellent butter and cheese made in the parish;
but the dairy is not carried to any great extent, owing to
the small farms, and the little portion allotted for pasture,
they depending chiefly upon the arable crops for their
profits.
   The number of milk-cows are in proportion to the size
of the farm, and will be from 6 to 12, or 14.  They rear
their black cattle and some horses, both of which are ge-
nerally of a good breed.
   It is expected, that here, and in other parts of the coun-
try, a more favourable rotation will take place.  Instead
of that ruinous practice of constant ploughing and scourging
the soil, equally impoverishing the tenant and the farm,
more will be allowed to grass, and less ploughed.  The
