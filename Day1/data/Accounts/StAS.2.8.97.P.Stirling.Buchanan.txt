In the upper part, especially along the side of Lochlomond, there
is some dry fertile kround, bearing good crops of oats and barley;
but the arable proportion is so small to the mountain pasture, that
it is little regarded when a tenant estimates the value of his farm.
lie ascertains the number of sheep which it keeps, and, calculates,
the rent at from L. d.to 1. 3, 10s.- per score. The sheep are black-
faced, of small size. ; Some attempts are making to improve them.
Cheviots have been tried, but found not to answer, on account of
the elevated exposed situation. The whole parish, except some
islets, and one farm of L. 40, belongs to the Duke of Montrose.
T,he rent is I- 5000, 17s. 6d: if the sales of wood, amounting to
L-2250, be added, the annual return to the proprietors is L.7250
17s. 6d.
