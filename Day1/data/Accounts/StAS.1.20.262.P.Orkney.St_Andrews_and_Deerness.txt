but curious on account of the many beautiful figures of sea-
weeds found between the plates.  These figures seem as if
elegantly painted in a brass colour, and many of them so
clear as to represent the finest fibre.  Pictish houses and tumuli
lie scattered over the whole face of the country.  Near the
end of the neck of land which joins St Andrews to Deer-
ness, are the remains of a very large one, called by the
country people Dingy's-how, or Duncan's-height; and be-
tween it and Deerness several hillocks of stones, seemingly
ruins of buildings.  The only other ruin that attracts notice,
is placed on a small neck of land jutting out into a fresh-
water lake behind the minister's house.  Its form is now
semicircular.  The wall is nine feet thick, in which, there

peat-ashes, have been found in different apartments on the
outside of the great wall.  The minister, who considers mo-

stones of this building for inclosing his glebe.

   Harbours.-Inganess and Deer Sound are excellent road-
steads, and belong to this parish.  Inganess Bay is bounded
on the west and south, by St Olay; and by Deerness on
the east and south-east.  The mouth of this bay, which is
to the north, is guarded by Shapinshay; and as it is quite
free from shoals, and the ground clean, being a mixture of
strong clay and sand, it is a place of great safety.  Its ex-
treme length is two one-half miles; its breadth one mile;
and the depth from twelve to two one-half fathoms.  The
best anchoring ground is about a mile from its summit, in
six or six one-half fathoms, and nearest to the west side of
