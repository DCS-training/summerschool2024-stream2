both tremenduous and pleasing.  A summer house or pa-
villion is situated over a high rocky bank, that overlooks
the Lin, built by Sir James Carmichael of Bonniton in
1708.  From its uppermost room it affords a very strik-
ing prospect of the fall, for all at once, on throwing your
eyes towards a mirror, on the opposite side of the room
from the fall, you see the whole tremendous cataract
pouring as it were upon your head.  The Corra Lin, by

though no traces now remain, exceping in tradition;
which still points out a rock called Wallace's Chair, where
that patriot is said to have concealed himself from the
English.  This fall is about 3 or 4 feet high, and trouts
have been observed to spring up and gain the top of it
with ease.  This fall, the village, four lofty cotton mills,
and their busy inhabitants together with the wild and
woody scenery around, must attract the notice of every
stranger.  Below these are the romantic rocks and woods
of Braxfield, the seat of the present Lord Justice Clerk,
who influenced alone by the good of his country, very
