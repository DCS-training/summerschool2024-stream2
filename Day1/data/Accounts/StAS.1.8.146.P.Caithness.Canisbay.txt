     Statistical Account

   Rent and Proprietors-The whole valued rent of the pa-
rish amounts to 3855 L. 3 s. 6 d. Scotch.  The real rent may
be computed at about 1300 L. Sterling.  From 1200 to 1500
bolls of victual are yearly exported, besides maintaining the
inhabitants.  Land is divided into what are called penny
lands, halfpenny lands, farthing lands, and octos.  Eight oc-
tos are reckoned equal to 12 acres.  The rent of an acre, at
an average, is not below a guinea.  In some places it is 30 s.
or upwards.  The Earl of Caithness, Robert Sinclair, Esq.
of Freswick, and the family of Brabster, are the only
proprietors in the parish.  Brabster is an inland proper-
ty, lying in the centre of the district.  All the other cul-
tivated lands are situated on the coast, extending, at an ave-
rage, about half an English mile from the shore.  There are
also frequent interjections of moss and moor, reaching down
to the sea coast, and dividing one cultivated district from
another-Hence it is apparent, how small a proportion of
this extensive parish is as yet brought into cultivation.

   Cultivation and Produce.-The medium extent of farms
does not exceed the sum of 9 L.  Sterling yearly rent.  By this
multiplicity of families, the soil is brought up to the highest
pitch of cultivation.-Oats and barley, in alternate crops, with
the addition of some flax and potatoes, are the sole objects of
agriculture.  The soil, at an average, yields about 5 returns
of oats, and above 7 of barley; but in some particular spots,
no less than 11 returns of barley have been reaped.-From
Martinmas till spring, the dung of the cattle is left in the
byre; a bedding of dry earth or peat mold is thrown above it
every day, which mixes with the dung, and, at the same time,
keeps the cattle warm and dry.  A cart load of this compost
is reckoned more valuable as a manure, than three of pure
dung, particularly, if thrown out and exposed to the weather
