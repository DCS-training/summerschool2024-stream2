    	A fuller detail might have been given of the commitments to
    prison, but on referring to the gaoler's book, I found so much uni-
    formity, that a return for two years appeared quite sufficient. The
    commitments of vagrants for one night have been omitted, as they
    are frequently lodged in prison rather from humanity than from
    any desire to punish them. The more aggravated crimes are little
    known, and there has been only one execution for very many years,
    and I am not aware that the criminal was a native of Tweeddale.
    To the credit of the inhabitants of the four pastoral and agricul-
    tural counties of Peebles, Selkirk, Berwick, and Roxburgh, which
    form the southern circuit, it may be stated that no circuit furnishes
    a smaller criminal calendar.
