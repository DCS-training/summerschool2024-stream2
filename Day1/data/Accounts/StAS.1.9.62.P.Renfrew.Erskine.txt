passengers.  The quays for it were lately built, and are
abundantly commodious.  The other called the West Fer-
ry, is opposite to the castle of Dunbarton, and is chiefly
used for foot-passengers.

   Fisheries.-There are two or three salmon fisheries in the
Clyde, as it passes along this parish; but as the fishing
banks are more contiguous to the opposite or Kilpatrick
shore, none of them are occupied by inhabitants of this pa-
rish.  The fish are taken in large nets, the rope of one end
of which being made fast to the shore or bank, and the net
laid in folds upon the flat end of a boat, the boat is rowed
a certain way into the river, dropping the net as it goes a-
long, and, having made a sweep against the tide, is brought
back to the place from which it set out.  The net is im-
mediately afterwards drawn ashore.  The right of catching
salmon on most of the fishing banks in Clyde from Ren-
frew, as far down as the confines of Ayrshire, belongs by
ancient charter to the burgh of Renfrew.  The salmon
fishery in this tract has, for many years, been rather scan-
ty.  The operations for improving the navigation of the
river, which were executed by the town of Glasgow a-
bout 20 years ago, are thought to have been prejudicial to
it.  The salmon are either carried to Renfrew, or sold in
the neighbourhood.  The medium price is about 5 d. or
6 d. the pound.  Besides salmon, there are in this track of
Clyde, considerable quantities of large red trout, which
are sometimes catched by set lines; and people who have
proper nets, often take considerable quantities of spirlings,
(smelts) and of shrimps.
