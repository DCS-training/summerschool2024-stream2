stilt; by this it was managed and conducted by the plough-
man, with his right hand only, and close at his right thigh;
it had scarcely a side board; though, for these reasons, it
was very uneasy for the ploughman, yet it was very light
and easy for the cattle.  It ploughed very well, and easy,
as I am informed; broke the earth as it turned it, served
the purpose of a first harrowing as it went along, and good
crops were raised after it.  For some time past there is none "
of them to be seen; for those now used are much the same
with those used in the south of Scotland.  These axe, in-
deed, more easy for the ploughman, yet not so for the cat-
tle, because they are heavier, and plough deeper, etc.
   The long yoke, as we call it, or two and two a-breast, be-
fore one another, is not used but by very few, and that oc-
casionally.  The old mode of four a-breast, or short yoke,
as we call it, is still the fashion.  This, however, though
not so easy and safe for the driver, who goes retrograde in
the furrow, with two on each side of him, is, I believe,
more advantageous for the cattle than the other.  For, in
draughts of every kind, it is very much in favour of the
drawing power to be near the centre of motion.  This is
manifestly the case in the short yoke, all the cattle being
equally near the plough, and having consequently an equal
share of the draught.  The only disadvantage arising from
it, besides the danger to which the driver is exposed, is,
that two of the cattle draw on the tilled ground, and there-
by trample it, which is both uneasy to them, and hurtful
to the ground; but these are nothing when compared to
the other advantages.
   It is only of late years also that carts began to be used.
Now the great advantage of them is seen and felt, and
the use of them is daily becoming more and more general.
They are increasing in number every year, especially as
we have the prospect of good roads.  Since carts be-
