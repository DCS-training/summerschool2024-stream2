found uniformly to attend a state of manufacturing prosperity it
will form an important deduction from the addition to the sum Of
national happiness which such prosperity produces.
  The chief improvement which the present state of agricultural
knowledge suggests, is furrow-draining, accompanied with the use
of Mr Smith of Deanston's trench plough, or some other method
of opening the subsoil, so as to allow  the escape of the water.
The trench plough has not yet been introduced, and perhaps the
subsoil is too stiff, and too full of boulders to admit of its introduc-
tion ; but furrow-draining is making yearly progress, and with
manifest advantage. Small stones are more frequently used for
filling than the drain tile, and seem preferable where they can
easily be procured; but, in many situations, they are not to be
had without great expense; and it is much to be desired that some
of our proprietors would establish kilns for the manufacture of
tiles.* Were the land once thoroughly drained, little would be
awanting to warrant us in saying that the parish is in a state of
high agricultural improvement
