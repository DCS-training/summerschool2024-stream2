ing critical juncture, the session, with the resident gentlemen
who were not members of it, met to take into consideration
the state of the poor, and to adopt such measures as might
tend to their immediate relief.  Accordingly the meeting
appointed one of their number in every district, to go to
solicit the charitable aid of those who had some victual to
spare, and to receive from them any quantity they might be
pleased to give as a donation to the poor.  In consequence
of this appointment, some bolls of meal were collected, 
and distributed among the most indigent.  Soon after, the
late Hon. General M'Kay, tutor to Lord Reay, sent 20 bolls

the low price of 8 s. per boll, prevented the dreaded conse-

   Language.-Gaelic is the language generally spoken, and
from it the names of the principal parts of the parish are
said to be derived.  The instances given are, Skerray, from
sker, a rock, and Iye, a man's name; Torrisdale, from tor, a 
tower, and dal, a valley; in which place are to be seen the ruins

from cean, a head, and loch, a lake or bay; Acheistal, from
achadh, a field, and caistal, a castle; Dalchairn, from dal, a
valley, and carn a heap; where there is a Druidical temple
built upon a plain.  It would require considerable skill in the
Gaelic to judge of the propriety of these derivations, and
whether sker and dal be Gaelic words.  Perhaps they are
common to that language and the Danish.

   Roads.-It is not many years since roads began to be made
in this parish; they are now carried on with great spirit, and
