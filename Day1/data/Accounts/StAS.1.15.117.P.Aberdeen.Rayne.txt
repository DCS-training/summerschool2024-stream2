the miller a lick of goodwill, or a bannock, which tenants have
sometimes allowed to be measured; and there are instances
where another unmeasured lick has crept in.  Even the seeds
sifted from the bannock are sometimes paid.  When all these
items are added together, they amount at some mills to a
twelfth or eleventh part of the whole corn carried to the mill.
This is a severe tax upon the industry of an improving
tenant.  Sometimes too the corn that grows on farms thir-
led to a mill, is obliged to pay multure, whether the corn be
ground at that mill or not.  Except the expence of grinding,
all thirlage should be commuted to the tenant, in order that
he may reap the benefit of his own industry.  But we have
one instance here where even this is prevented, the ten-
ants of one estate being thirled to the mill of another.  Ano-
ther absurdity is, that shillen, i.e. shealing, or hulter corn, is
measured by the tacksman of the mill, and is paid, not in
shealing, but in meal.  There are accordingly great com-
plaints that the corn is not well shealed.  Another evil is,
that there is a mill peck, which generally holds as much shealing
as will grind to three and sometimes four pecks of meal.
For the shealing of the stock, the tenant pays meal measur-
ed with a cog, or wooden dish, that pays for a certain quan-
tity of shealing.  There is also another cog for small quan-
tities of shealing.  And if all there measures were accurate-
ly fixed and proportioned, there would be less injustice; but
that is not the case.  The multurer is allowed to mend them
or make them a new, or alter them as he pleases.  There
ought to be a book kept by the proprietor of the mill, and
signed by him and the multurer, and the principal tenants,
in order to ascertain the exact contents of these several mea-
sures.  We have also some Gothic services done by the tenants,
that ought to be abolished, such as reaping, earing, plow-
