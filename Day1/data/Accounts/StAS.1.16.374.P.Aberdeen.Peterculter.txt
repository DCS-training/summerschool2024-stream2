confined to common paper for printing and writing, to
pasteboard, cartridge-paper, and all kinds of wrapping pa-
per, etc.  For all there a ready market is found at Aber-
deen, where the demand is greater than can be supplied
by this and the paper-mill on Don.  With the machinery
of the paper-mill is connected that of a barley-mill.
   I cannot help taking notice of the situation of this mill,
which is beautifully romantic, or might be made so.  It
stands in a bottom containing about 6 acres, almost sur-
rounded by a steep hill, the front of which is seemingly
composed of the segments of different circles; the burn of
Culter rolling along in a straight line, or parabolic curves.
The precipice is highest on the N. the N. W. and the W.
thence declivous towards the south, at which, and the
south-east point, there is some opening.  To the eye, the
front of the steep would seem, in some places, to be nearly
perpendicular, and the angle of declivity does not exceed
23ø.  The perpendicular height is, in some parts, about
400 feet.  The stream of water could be carried over a high
part of the precipice, and would form a grand cascade,
which, with the planting of the circumjacent slopes, would
add much to the beauty of the scene.
   About 5 years since, a distillery, consisting of two stills,
(each containing 40 gallons), with proper utensils, was
erected in the south-east corner of this parish, on the burn
of Murtle, nigh to the spot where a barley-mill formerly
stood, and not far from the river Dee.  When the duty
was raised, the business was interrupted for some time;
but it is now resumed by a company at Aberdeen, who
proceed briskly, and make excellent spirits.  Although
the distance from Aberdeen be only 5 miles, the spirits
distilled here cannot be carried to that market.  Small is
the quantity which can be vended within the parish, and
they must therefore try to find merchants across the coun-
