   Agriculture.-A better mode of cultivating the land is now
adopted than what formerly prevailed.  But a regular rota-
tion of crops is not yet established, though considerable
quantities of turnips and potatoes are reared annually.  Oats
and barley are still the principal crops in this parish.  Should,
however, the canal above mentioned take place, many hun-
dreds of acres, besides those which were once cultivated, but
are now deserted, would be brought into cultivation; and,
instead of a poor stinted sort of heath, would produce lux-
uriant crops of corn and grass.

   Manure.-The only manure used in this parish, except
the dung raised on the farms, is lime brought from Aber-
deen.  There was a small quantity of marl on one farm,
called Nether Boddom, but it was exhausted several years
ago.  And so ignorant were the country people of its pro-
per value, that they used it as plaster to the walls of these
houses.  It was, however, of considerable service to the farm
in which it was found.  Perhaps this small quantity is a
proof that more marl might be discovered in the district, if
the proprietors would be at the expence of searching for it.

   Population.-The population of this parish has decreased
within these 40 years.  In Dr Webster's account it is stated
at 995; it is now only 900, or 95 less.  The population of
the country parishes in the north of Scotland decreased
much in the end of the last century, as may be seen, by
comparing the numbers who paid the poll tax, (a number
certainly short of the whole population), with the numbers
given in Dr Webster's account.  There was, however, in the
first 60 years of this century, a rapid increase of the popula-
tion, which was brought pretty near to its former state,
When the scarcity of moss in country parishes, and the de-
