   The number of inhabited houses is 87; a few are at
present uninhabited.  There are 12 farmers, besides those
who occupy small possessions, 9 masons, 7 house carpen-
ters and plough-wrights, 8 weavers, 3 shoemakers, 2
blacksmiths, 2 tailors, 2 thatchers, 1 cooper, 3 hedgers,
apprentices included, and 4 day labourers.  The rest of
the men are in general hinds, ploughmen, barnmen, and
shepherds.  The unmarried women, who are not hired
from year to year, are employed in spinning to manufac-
turers and others throughout the winter, and in the sum-
mer and harvest are occupied in hoeing potatoes and tur-
nips, hay-making, reaping corn, etc.  The great bulk of
the people are hearers of the Established Church, but a
considerable number are attached to the Relief, Burgher,
Antiburghers, and Cameronians, and go to Dunse and,
Chirnside to hear sermon+.

kept with any degree of exactness; and I wish not to have any thing in-,
serted in this account, for the truth of which I cannot answer.
+A schoolmaster, who officiated as precentor in the parish, about 30
years ago, is said to have been (very innocently, in my judgment) the
occasion of much secession here.  Anxious to improve the church psalmo-
dy, one Sunday afternoon, without consulting the minister, he, with a
few vocal friends who were acquainted with his intention, made a trial
of singing the psalm without leading the line.  This innovation so shocked.
many of the bearers, that they never afterwards could be reconciled to
the Established Church.
