field from 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s. 6 d. per acre.  The rents are paid at 4
terms in the years, partly in money and partly in meal; and
the tenants are obliged to carry their farm-meal to Aberdeen,
or the like distance.  There are no discretionary services ex-
acted.  The tenants are in their tacks taken bound for a few
services; one half of which are seldom required, and no mo-

the country, seldom leave it; and, when they do, with great
reluctance, returning as soon as they can.
