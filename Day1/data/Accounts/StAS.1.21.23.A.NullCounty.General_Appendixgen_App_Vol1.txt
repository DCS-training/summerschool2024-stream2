money thus raised will be properly laid out.  New roads are
to be made, and the old ones kept in good repair.  Turn-
pikes are considered as of great importance to the country.
   The lands are in a very few cases inclosed; the surface of
the parish being mountainous, and the farms being fitted for
sheep, and extensive, do not admit of being inclosed.  Though
a small inclosure or two near to a farm house are necessary to
confine a few sheep or cattle occasionally, and this conve-
nience every farm has.  Most of the farms have not been mea-
sured, though I believe some of the Duke of Roxburgh's have.
The lands are seldom let at so much per acre.  The farmers
calculate the value by the number of sheep the lands are known
or supposed to keep.
