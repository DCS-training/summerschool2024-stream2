     PARISH OF MAINS OF FINTRY.

     (COUNTY OF FORFAR.)

     Communicated by the Rev. Mr CHARLES PEBBLES.

     Name, Situation, Soil and Climate, etc.

   THE ancient name of this parish was Strathdighty,
being part of that pleasant Strath, through which
Dighty directs its course to the frith of Tay.  The pre-
sent name is Mains of Fintry, from the old family seat of
Fintry, which is near the chruch.  It belongs to the pres-
bytery of Dundee, and synod of Angus and Mearns.  It is
4 miles long, and 3 broad about the middle; but becomes con-
siderably narrower toward the extremities.  The water of
Dighty, which runs from west to east, interesects the parish
into nearly two equal parts; and from the banks of this beau-
tiful stream, the ground rises gently to the north and south.
The face of the country has a sweet and delightful appear-
ance, being all enclosed with thorn hedges, which are in a
very flourishing state.  They shelter and beautify the 
fields; but at the same time attract great flocks or birds,
