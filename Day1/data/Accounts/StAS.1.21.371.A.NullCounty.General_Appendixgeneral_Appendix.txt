     STATISTICAL ACCOUNT

     OF THE

     PARISH OF KILRONAN,

     IN IRELAND,

     AND OF THE NEIGHBOURING DISTRICT.

     Introduction.

I request that the reader would have the goodness to excuse
my inserting the following account of a parish in Ireland;
but I am led to do it, out of respect to the memory of a
very public-spirited individual, the late Right Hon. William
Burton Conyngham, who transmitted it to me, as the only
account worth preserving, received by the Dublin Society,
when they circulated their queries, regarding the state of
Ireland, in 1773: And indeed I think that this paper, in
some degree, explains the circumstances which have con-
tributed to the rebellion which has lately raged in that
kingdom, and which, I trust, is now fortunately extin-
guished.  It must satisfy every thinking individual, at the
same time, that, by attention on the part of the Irish go-
vernment, by the introduction of industry and knowledge
among a people so highly favoured by nature, and by pro-
moting, through the medium of judicious political inves-
tigations, useful public institutions, and wise laws, the
prosperity of the country, that the seeds of rebellion may
be eradicated.
