divided into 4 inclosures, are managed precisely in the same
way; with this only difference, that every inclosure rests 9
years instead of 6.-The Scotch plough, of the lightest and
best kind, is generally used; and it is drawn by 3, and some-
times by 4 horses, with a man and a boy.  The price of the
plough is from 25 s. to 30 s.  When the season happens to be
uncommonly dry, oats and beans begin to be sown about the
middle of March; but, in general, very little is sown before
the month of April.  Bear continues to be sown, from about
the beginning to the latter end of May.  There is no general
harvest till about the first, and sometimes the second week of
September.  It is mostly over about the latter end of October.
By far the greatest part of the hay and harvest work is done by
women, at from 1 s. to 15 d. a day, without victuals.  When
hired till the whole of the grain is cut down, which is the
more general practice, they have from 25 s. to 30 s., with
board.

   Failure of the Crop in 1782.-Different causes, no doubt, con-

in this parish, and in others immediately on the sea coast, the
chief cause of its failure was owing to a very severe west
wind, about the middle, or towards the latter end of the
month of August, which continued with the utmost violence
for a considerable time.  The corns had their roots loosened,
and were otherwise much damaged by this storm.  From be-
ing in general very green, when it happened, in a few days
afterwards they grew white, but never filled.  Snow also, in
such parts of the parish as were at the greatest distance from
the sea, fell earlier, and in greater quantities, than ever had
been known at that season of the year.  A boll of well ripen-
ed oats yields, at an average, from 17 to 20 pecks of meal,
and even, sometimes, more: But, in 1782, the boll of oats,
