conveniency to other parishes, as well as to Canisbay.  Tip-
pling houses are by far too numerous in the parish:  They
have undoubtedly a bad influence on the industry, as well as
morals of the people.  Three, besides the ferry houses, are all
that ought to be allowed.  From Huna, the ferry boat crosses
with the mails for Orkney once a week.  From Burwick in
South Ronaldshay, the Orkney mails in like manner cross to
Huna.  The distance there, being the shortest betwixt Caith-
ness and Orkney, is reckoned 4 leagues in extent.  If a pas-
senger goes along with the mails, the freight is 1 s.; but if he
hires the ferry boat for himself, it is 7 s.  Although the Pent-
land Frith may be deservedly accounted the most tempestuous
piece of sea, around the island of Britain, it is remarkable how
few accidents happen in crossing it; but the danger it
threatens, suggests the means of preventing it.  The time of
tide is observed to a minute, in putting out to sea.  The boats
are strong and of good construction; the boatmen perfect mas-
ters of their business, and acquainted from their infancy with
every circumstance, respecting the variation of the tides they
have to go through.  In the summer season, there is almost a
continued communication betwixt Caithness and Orkney, in
the traffic of horses.  Colts from the highlands of Caithness,
from Sutherland and Strathnaver are fold to Orkney; and there
very colts, when past their prime, are again brought from Ork-
ney, and re-imported into Caithness.  By far the greatest
number of these cross to and from the shores of Canisbay, on
account of the shortness of the passage.  Large boats are made
for transporting them; and the freight of each colt is 1 s., and
a full grown horse 1 s. 8 d. to the nearest land.  There are
2 petty markets in the parish, in the course of a year, one in
December, and the other in February.
