beyond the low ground, on the north of it, and on the east
of the ancient suburb known by the name of the Bonnet-
Hill.  The point of the principal pier in the harbour, is in
56 degree 27'. 23". of latitude, and in 3 degree 2'. 55". of longitude, west
from Greenwich, or in time 12'. 11'.  The latitude may be
considered as accurate, being the result of a great variety of
observations made with a good Hadley's Quadrant, both in
the meridian and ether circles of altitude, at a place judged
to be in the same parallel with the point now mentioned; but
the conclusion for the longitude, is calculated only from a few
lunar eclipses, and by geoditical deductions from the meridian
of Hawk-Hill near Edinburgh.

   Soil.-In a parish so extensive, there must be a consider-
able variety of soil.  Little of it, however, is naturally rich.
The rising ground, in particular, which runs west from the
town towards Blackness, was originally thin and poor, with a
gravelly bottom, and the surface was covered, probably, for a
long time, with heath.  About Blackness, the soil continues
equally thin, and the bottom is of till.  But, to the north of
Blackness, particularly on the east end of the Hill of Balgay,
the soil is deeper, and consists of a rich black earth Except
about the old casle of Dudhope, and on the low grounds behind
the town of Dundee, the soil of the Law is poor, with a bot-
tom of till.  The ground to the eastward of the Law, though
better, is not remarkably rich; a good part of Craigie, which
consists of the best of it, was moor not 30 years ago, and the
bottom is generally till.  To the eastward of Craigie, the soil,
in some farms of the Douglas estate, becomes better, and in-
clines to clay.  The best land is in the bottom, where Digh-
ty and Fiethy meet.  It includes part of Baldovie and Drum-
gieth, and seems to be a deposit from these two waters.  The
estate of Pitkerro, bounded on three sides by Fiethy, Dighty,
