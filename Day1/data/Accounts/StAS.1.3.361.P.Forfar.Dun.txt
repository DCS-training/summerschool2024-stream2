great quantities of barley, oats, and pease.  Potatoes are
commonly planted about the middle of April, and turnips
about the middle of June.  Some farmers feed cattle with
turnips, which turn out to very good account, as there
is a great demand for butcher meat, the parish being situ-

Montrose and Brechin.  There are but few sheep kept in this
district, (as they are thought prejudical to the sown grass and
hay), excepting such as are necessary for the use of the inha-
bitants.

   School.-There is one public school in the parish.  The
legal salary of the schoolmaster is only 100 merks, too small
encouragement to obtain a properly qualified person for that
office; and therefore the heritors, minister, and principal
tenants in the parish, have subscribed a certain sum in addi-
tion to the legal salary, in order to make up a tolerable living
for the schoolmaster.

   Population.-The number of parishioners, in the year 1750,
by the late incumbent's examination roll, amounted to 506.
Afterwards they increased greatly; for in the years 1760, and
1766, they amounted to 640.  But after that period, when
many small farms were converted into one, the numbers de-
creased, and at present do not exceed 500 souls.  In Dr Web-
ster's list, the number is 657.  There is a register of mar-
riages, births, and burials, kept, an extract of which, for ten
years past, is as follows:
