ron Company, who buy up all the iron-stone in this parish,
and in almost all this county, pay for this at the rate of 9 s per
ton delivered at their works, or on the banks of the great ca-
nal.  But this is generally allowed to be a price very inade-
quate to its value, which is comparatively great.  For the most
part these balls are found in a deep bank of blaes.  They lie
in regular strata, at unequal and irregular distances.  But the
balls of each stratum are generally of the same size; towards
the top of the bank, they are smaller, and larger be-
low.  Though the balls, when collected, are valuable, yet
the quantity of blaes is so great, in comparison with the
quantity of iron-stone, and the strata are at such a distance,
that it never can be wrought to a great extent with much ad-
vantage.  Yet, as it lies on the course of a rapid burn, and
as the blaes is soft and friable, there are considerable quanti-
ties of it washed down daily, but especially at every flood;
while the balls are left behind.  It is in this way chiefly that
they have been hitherto collected.
   Immediately under the bank of blaes in which this ball
iron stone is lodged, there is a very fine post of lime-stone.  In
some places it is only 3 or 4, but for the most part 7 or 8 feet
thick.  It is a conglomeration of small shells, of all sizes, from
an inch diameter, till they become so small as to be invisible
to the naked eye.  Their form is as various as their size:
but for the most part, they are long and cylindrical, and
somewhat like a screw.  I believe the technical name for
such is orthoceratitæ.  They are generally supposed to be
an extraneous fossil; for the original shell has not yet been
discovered in any of the frequented seas.  The greatest part
of these are very small; though I have seen some an inch in
diameter; and 3 or 4 inches long.
   At one time, I had occasion to pick up a petrifaction
rather of an uncommon shape, size, and colour.  It was lod-
