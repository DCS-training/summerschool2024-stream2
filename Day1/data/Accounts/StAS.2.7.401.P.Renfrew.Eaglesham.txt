larly about Threepland, the Ardochs, Kevochs, Greenfields, Kirk-
tonmuirs, Lochcraig, Binning, &c.  A great many of the farm-
houses have been recently rebuilt, and are on greatly improved
plans; the old ones, however, are very bad.  The great obstacle
to improvement on the part of the tenants is want of capital, and
perhaps the proprietors of large estates, generally, do not give the
encouragement required.  As this property is at present situated,
the Earl of Eglinton has no blame to be attached to him on that
score.
   Produce.-The average gross amount of raw produce raised in
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained :

        3000 bolls of oats for meal, at L. 1 per boll,  L.3000  0  0
        2000 for other purposes,                          2000  0  0
        Dairy produce from 1000 cows,                     9000  0  0
        All other produce,                                6000  0  0
                                                      L.20,000  0  0

   In this estimate the young stock and sheep are not included,
and several other items, which may raise the whole L. 1000 or
L. 2000, but as the author has no precise data to proceed upon,
he cannot form an exact estimate.
   Manufactures.-There are two cotton-mills in the parish, one
at Eaglesham, and one at Millhall on a much smaller scale.  The
mill at Eaglesham village belongs to the firm of Maclean and
Brodie, Glasgow.  It contains 15,312 spindles, and spins yarns
from No. 50 to No. 60.  The machinery is driven by a magnificent
water-wheel of iron forty-five feet in diameter; and of fifty horse
power.  It was planned by the late James Dunlop, Esq., and was
manufactured by Murdoch and Aikin, engineers, Glasgow.  About
740 cubic feet of water fall on the wheel per minute, and yet it is
so artfully introduced and carried away, that no water is seen
within the walls where the wheel is erected.  The following is the
number of hands employed.

  This mill was built at different periods, and has once or twice
been burnt down.  It is confined entirely to mule-spinning.  There
is no throstle-spinning nor power-looms.  The mill at Millhall
