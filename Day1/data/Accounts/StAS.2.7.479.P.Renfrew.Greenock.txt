     The money deposited is lent to the three trusts of the town of
   Greenock, from whom interest is received at 4 per cent.
     The balance due by the bank is now so large that the directors
   at one time contemplated placing the institution under the Act of
   Parliament.  But the anticipated increase of the trade of Greenock
   rendering additional harbour accommodation necessary, it is pro-
   bable that the bank deposits may be taken up by the Harbour
   Trust for some time to come.
     The regulations of the bank are few and simple, like those of
   other establishments of the same kind; and the rates of interest
   are so adjusted as to encourage the poorest artisan to deposit his
   smallest savings; and at the same time to prevent the abuse of the
   institution by the more prosperous portion of the community. The
   rates of interest on deposits are:
                 4 1/2  per cent. on all sums under L.5
                 4         do.        do.     from L. 5 to L.30
                 3 1/2     do.        do.        L. 30 to L.100
                 3         do.        do.      above      L.100

     The annexed statement, laid by the directors before the an-
   nual general meeting on the 26th October 1839, presents a very
   pleasing aspect of the successful working of this admirable insti-
   tution.
      At last balance, the amount due by the bank to 3315 dposi-
          tors, was                                                L.55,800 0 0

      It is stated farther by the directors in the report from which the
      above excerpt is taken, that the years 1838-39 presented an in-
     crease greater by one-fifth of the whole than has taken place in
     any former year, both in the number and the amount of the trans-
     RENFREW.                           Ii
