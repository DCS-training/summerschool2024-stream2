   The number of depositors on November 20th 1841, was 692,
and the amount due to them, L.6919, 9s. 8d.
   Poor.-The number of persons receiving regular parochial aid
is 38; those who receive occasional supplies fully equal that number.
The collections made in church for their support amount to about
L.45.  There are no legal assessments, but the heritors give an-
nually in donations, a sum varying from, L.32 to L.40 Sterling.
There is also a coal fund, to which the benevolent contribute li-
berally.  Formerly it was considered degrading to receive paro-
chial aid, and those in labouring circumstances would have sub-
mitted to hardships and privations, rather than "come on the box,"
but this feeling of honest pride has of late years been greatly
weakened, which I attribute partly to the influence of the manufac-
turing population, and partly to the indifference shown by some of
the burgh proprietors to the characters of those whom they admit
from other parts of the country as tenants of their houses.
