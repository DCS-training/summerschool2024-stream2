the quantity which it annually consumes, yield 185,000 gallons of
proof spirits, the duty on which amounts of itself to about L. 36,000;
or nearly L. 100 per day. About 700 head of cattle are annually
fed in connection with this distillery, which at L. 15, 10s. per head,
will produce L. 10,850. The proprietors of this work employ re-
gularly about 100 men and 50 horses. Notwithstanding the na-
ture oftheir employment, the men, in general, are sober and steady.
Herring fishery and curing.-The herring fishery commenced
about 1793, and from that period till about 1805, was carried on
only in the Frith during the winter season. The curers then be-
gan to send boats during summer to the northern fishing stations,
and for many years the trade was very prosperous. At its most
flourishing period, as many as 500 vessels might be seen at once in
the harbour, all either connected directly with the fishery, or em-
ployed in the exportation of herrings. The trade has now greatly
declined, there having been no winter fisbing for the last five years.
At present, there are eight curing establishments which send out to
the northern fishery between 70 and 80 boats, most of which
belong to other ports in the Fritb. The greater part of them go
to Wick, the rest to Fraserburgh and Rosehearty. The middle of
July is the time at which they usually set out, and they return in
about two months. Each boat carries five men, so that during
two months in the year, Burntisland employs in this way about 400
men. A number more are employee in the sloops which, to the
number of 8 or 10, ply during the same period between this port
and the fishing stations, carrying out barrels and salt, and bringing
home the herrings that have been taken. From 200 to 250 cranes,
(a crane being equal to a barrel,) are considered to be the com-
plement of each boat. For some years, there have been annually
cured from 16,000 to 18,000 barrels, which, at L. 1, the average
price per barrel, will give the same number of pounds. About 36
hands, including apprentices, are constantly employed as coo'pers;
and about 60 females are occasionally employed in the curing of
the herrings. The occupation is cold and disagreeable; but even
this cannot warrant a pernicious practice that has IODg prevailed, of
giving daily to those engaged in it, and some of these are young
females, a considerable quantity of undiluted spirits.
Whalefishing Company.-Thi's company commenced operations
in 1830, and from that period have annually sent out two; vessels,
One of 377 tons, and the other of 31 1,-each of which carries 50
men. Last season, both returned clean but from 1830 to 1835,
