   Religious Societies.-There is no regular organized religious as-
sociation in the parish. but a subscription for religious and chari-
table purposes, conducted by the ministers and members of ses-
sion has been made for the last two years, amounting in, 1837, to
L. 49, 16r. 11d., and in 1838 to L. 52, 17s. 3d.
   Education.-There are 7 schools in the parish, one parochial,
one connected with the General Assembly's Scheme; and the rest
an the teachers' own adventure.  The branches of instruction ge-
nerally taught are, Gaelic, English, English grammar,: arithmetic,
mathematics, book-keeping, geography and Latin.  The parish
schoolmaster has the legal accommodations except the garden,
for which he receives the allowance which the act assigns.  The
salary is the maximum, L. 34, 4s. 4 1/2d.
   In January 1889, the number of scholars in all the schools
throughout the parish was 388, boys 234, girls 154. There were
learning to read, 112; joined writing to their reading, 276, and of
these again there were at arithmetic, 77 ; at English grammar, 31 ;
at mathematics, 1O and at Latin, 6.
   In Pitlochry there is a sewing schoolmistress, who receives L. 5
from the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge.
   Sabbath Schools.-There are six Sabbath evening schools in the
parish, attended. in January 1839 by upwards of 300 scholars.
   The people are in, general fully alive to the benefits of educa-
lion. Many of them are at such distances from school as to make
it inconvenient for their children to attend regularly.  The Strath-
ardle district of the parish, I grieve to say  destitute of the
means of edtcation. There is truly no lack of teachers, but, from
the encouragement given, they are necessarily of an inferior descrip-
tion. An active, zealous, and intelligent teacher, such as might be
expected from the General Assembly's Education Committee,
would be an unspeakable blessing to the children of that remote
position of the parish. *

<FOOTNOTE>It is gratifying to observe the lively interest that is being taken of late in the
educational prosperity of that section of the parish, and it is hoped that, ere long we
shall see the Strathardie division enjoying the privileges of our more favourd localities.
