seems to have excited less attention from Government than
that of the other sciences, as this profession was not establish-

of late years, been introduced into all the sciences connected
with the art of medicine.  The progress of botany and natu-
ral history, and the wonderful discoveries in chemistry, have
now extentled the sphere of these useful branches beyond the
mere purposes of the physician, and have rendered a compe-
