of the burials, because, though there are now three burying
places in the parish, yet a great part of the inhabitants are
terred in the burying grounds belonging to the city.

   Public Houses.-In the beginning of the year 1791, there
were 169 public houses for retailing malt and spiritous li-
quors.  The vast increase of these houses is one of the great-
est injuries to the morals, the health, and the prosperity of
the inhabitants.  In almost every village, several low houses
of this sort are to be found; and the consequences are at once
both obvious and melancholy.  If the number of virtuous in-
habitants be the strength of a state, then enlightened policy
should lead to the suppression of many of these houses, and
particularly to discourage the use of all spiritous liquors.

   Ecclesiastical State of the Parish, School, Poor, etc.-The
parish church is a part of that venerable building, the cathe-
dral of Glasgow, and has been occupied by the Barony since
the year 1595.  Being of an arched roof, which is low, and
supported by a great number of massy pillars, it is exceeding-
ly dark, dirty, and incommodious; of this the heritors are so
sensible, that a visitation of the presbytery has been called up-
on it this year; and there is some probability of another
church being built for the accommodation of the inhabitants.
At Shettleston, in the least end of the parish, a Chapel of Ease
was erected about 50 years ago; and there is another, as
mentioned above, at North Woodside, supported at the sole ex-
pense of Mr. William Gillespie.  Another chapel is much
needed in the village of Calton, and, it is to be hoped, will
be provided.  At Anderston, there is a Relief Church, built
about 20 years ago: one Cameronian meeting in the Calton,
and another at Sandyhills, in the east end of the parish,
Though there are many dissenters of different denominations
