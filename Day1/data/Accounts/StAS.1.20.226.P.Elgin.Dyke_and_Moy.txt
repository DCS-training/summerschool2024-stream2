     Statistical Account

ago, was punished by his public execution.-A murder was
committed, in 1780, on a strolling packman; the perpetra-
tor never was discovered.

   Character of the People.-The people are, very generally,
decent,quiet,and well affected to the religion and government
under which they live.  They are neither addicted to a sea-
faring or military life; yet the frequency of recruiting par-
ties reconciles them, when that business is accompanied with
music, mirth, and drink.  They can live poorly, to dress
neatly; but few think of laying any thing up.  On public
accasions, there are not a few who will spend, what they
can ill afford, in vying to be neighbour-like, with others
who are either more rich, or more inconsiderate than them-
selves.  In general, they are better fed and clothed, and
have greater  variety of convenient furniture, than they had
40 years ago.  But the use of tea makes rather an alarming 
progress among many, who need a better nourishment, at 
less expence.

   Means of bettering their Condition.-The best means to
meliorate their situation, would be manufactures, for which
this parish, with such a soil and climate, and so near the 
port of Findhorn, is no unpromising situation.  Having plen-
ty of flat grounds, well watered, and being very fit for the
cultivation of flax, it seems by nature best adapted for the 
linen manufacture, in all its branches, of flax-dressing, spin-
ning, weaving, bleaching, and thread-making.
   Cotton manufacture is now going forward at Skibo and
Spinningdale, where L. 4000 a-year is now circulated, in
Sutherland, for which branch this parish would be no less
commodious.
