   Fisheries.-There are 12 fishing for boats white and
lobsters, which employ about 40 men.  There is a custom-
house, in which there are a collector and comptroller, a land 
surveyor, a tide surveyor, 4 tide-waiters, and a custom-
house boat, with 7 men belonging to it.-The ships belong-
ing to the East Lothian and Merse fishing Company, are 
stationed at Dunbar.  They were once 5 in number, but 
are now reduced to 2.  This company were established in 
1752, and has continued with various success.  It is the 
oldest of the kind in Britain, and, upon, the whole, has 
been the most successful.-The herring fishery was former-
ly more considerable and regular.  It is of great benefit to 
the town, and to all the country round; but for several 
years past, it has become very precarious and uncertain.

   Trade and Manufacturers.-The corn trade is the
most considerable branch.  It is sold, chiefly, by samples,
in the weekly market, which is held every Thursday.
