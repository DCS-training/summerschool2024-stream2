   Disadvantages.-One great disadvantage which the farmer
in this place labours under, is the high multure which he
pays to the mills.  If he send eight bolls of corn to the
mill, he must leave one of them for mill-dues.  But the
principal disadvantage, and which above every other thing
retards all improvement in agriculture, is the want of fuel,
of which no kind whatever, young fir-trees excepted, is to
be found within the parish; and these fir trees, or thinnings
of the woods, are generally sold at such a rate, that it
would be much easier for the people to provide themselves
in coals.  The fuel used in this parish consists chiefly of
peat and turf, of which they carry from the distance of
five or six miles; and in cutting and carrying which, the
farmers and their servants are employed for the whole of
the summer season, to the total neglect of every thing that
might improve and benefit their farms.  And what is still
more distressing, many of them are under the necessity of
going through the sands to fetch home their fuel, and must
therefore by night and by day watch the oppurtunity
when the tide is out, so that it is no unusual thing to see
them set out for the moss at the time when others go to
rest.  The badness of the roads, and the great distance
which they have to go, occasion them great expense in
carts and harness; and after all they have but most uncom-
fortable fuel.  If the season be wet, they generally lose
their labour, being not able to carry their fuel out of the
moss; and what they carry home is so wet, that it will not
answer for fire.  It was therefore with the highest satis-
faction they learned, that it is intended to bring a bill into
Parliament, to repeal the duties payable on coals carried
coastwise to the North, as it will enable them to procure
fuel at a cheaper rate, and with far less drudgery, and at
the same time will permit them to direct their attention to
agriculture, which at present, from the above-mentioned
cause, is too much neglected by them.
