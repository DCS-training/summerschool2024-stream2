to sea in quest of food, they are commonly in a pitiful lean
condition; and yet they are so shy, that it is scarcely possi-
ble, by any artifice, to come at them.

   Birds and Quadrupeds.-The quadrapeds and birds, in this
tract of country, are the same as through the rest of the
Highlands.  Grous and muirsowl are, however, less plen-
tiful here than in many other places; for the hills and fields
are too bare to afford much cover for these birds; and, as
there are few corn fields, neither can hares or partridges find
much food or shelter here.  Both the black cattle and the
sheep of Durness are esteemed to be of an uncommonly ex-
cellent breed.  Cape Wrath has long been reckoned an ex-
cellent sheep walk; the sheep stock sed upon it was, how-
ever, much more numerous 30 years pass, than at present,
having been disjoined from the contiguous farm of Balna-
ciell, and affording, itself, no sit pasture for the younger
stock, it has same suffered a rapid decrease.

   Agriculture and Produce.-The grain produced here is bar-
ley and black oats.  White oats have been found to dege-
nerate greatly in a few successive sowings.  Great quantities
of potatoes are planted every year.  The plough is used in
planting and hocing them, and answers extremely well for
this article of crop.  Cabbages, green kail, turnips, carrots,
etc. are produced in the gardens.  In favourable seasons, the
parish produces as much as maintains its inhabitants.  In
years of scarcity, it is supplied from Caithness.  It is  a hap-
py circumstance, that the bottom of Loch-Borley contains
an inexhaustible sand of the richest shell marle.

   Roads.-No roads have yet been made through this tract
of country, and, of consequence, on no occasion has the sta-
tute labour yet been exacted.
