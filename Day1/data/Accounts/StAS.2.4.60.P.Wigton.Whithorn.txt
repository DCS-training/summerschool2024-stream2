                     MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	The greatest grievance that is felt in this parish at present, and
which is most detrimental to its respectability and improvement,
is the extent of emigration, and the description of people that emi-
grate. Our native labourers and artisans, with their little proper-
ty and many virtues, are drifting across the Atlantic, and Ireland,
from her exhaustless store, is supplying their place. The num-
ber of Irish families that every year take up their abode in this
place is almost incredible. These are possessed of nothing but a
number of naked, starving children. The rupply of labourers
usually exceeds the demand, and wages are thereby reduced so
low, that Scottish labourers who wish to feed, clothe, and educate
their children, have it not in their power, and are compelled to
seek in a foreign country what is denied them in their own. The
children of Irish parents are driven out to seek food where they
can find it; and if clad and educated they are so at the expense of
others. Unless means are immediately devised for arresting the
progress of such a national calamity, the labourers in Scotland will
soon be reduced to the level of the lowest of the Irish; and the only
means of accomplishing this is a legal provision for the poor Irish
in their own country.
