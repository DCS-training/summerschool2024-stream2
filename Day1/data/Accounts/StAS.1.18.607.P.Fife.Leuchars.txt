to bed, but still called for the person to play, till the feelings
that produced the agitation were abated.
   Some years ago, the people in this parish professed a religi-
ous scruple against innoculating their children.  They are
now come to look upon it as a religious duty to adopt the
practice; and not a few of them, when a lancet loaded with
matter was procured for them, innoculated their own chil-
dren.  If the scruple could be got over throughout all parts
of the country, how many lives would it save, how many
sore-hearts to parents would it be the means under God of
preventing?

   Character of the People.-They are in general sober and
industrious; regular attendants upon Divine worship on the
Lord's day; and grateful to a kind providence for the blessings
they enjoy.  They are remarkably steady in their attach-
ments, in their loyalty to Our Gracious Sovereign and happy
Constitution: 14 from this district entered to serve His
Majesty when a late call for sailors was made through the
counties.-With what pleasure do I relate these facts, after
having read with horror in the Advertiser, for Tuesday the
3d November 1795, the wicked and treasonable attack made
upon the sacred person of George the III.  Thanks and
praise with my whole heart do I offer to the providence of
God, for preserving the life of the best of Kings, who has
ever been the father of his people; and pray most servently,
that the crown may long, very long flourish on his sacred
head, until it please the unerring Disposer of all events, to
crown Our Gracious King with a crown that shall for ever
flourish in glory, and transfer his earthly crown to the head
of His Royal Highness George Prince of Wales.
