the growth of this country, which they manufacture into
coarse cloth; and partly flax imported from Holland, which
is made into finer yarn; and sent from this to Paisley or
Glasgow.  At present, the price of spinning is low, and a
woman cannot earn more than 20 d, or 2 s a-week.
   The farmers are in general poor.  Considering the state of
cultivation, the land is high-rented, the best paying nearly
20 s, and the inferior 10 s; but, besides the fixed rent, the
tenant pays the land-tax; is obliged to work so many days in

   The parish consists of 630 souls, of whom males 301;
females 329; the number of families 150; the average num-

years of age; 85 between 10, and 20.  There are no remark-
able instances of longevity; there are only about 3 persons in
the parish above 80.  We have 15 Seceders; 3 Roman ca-
