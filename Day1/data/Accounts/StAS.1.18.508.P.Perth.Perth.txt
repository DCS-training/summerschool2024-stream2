of Ruthvens to the abbey of Scone.  It appears from the
names of some of the witnesses, that it was granted in or be-
fore the year 1200.  In this charter, the situation of Perth at
the time is marked beyond all doubt, by a description of the
road which led from Perth to Tibbermuir.
   "I grant," says the above named donor, "and by this my
"charter, have confirmed to God, and to the church of the
"Holy Trinity, and of St Michael of Scone, and to the ca-
"nons serving God, and to serve him there, that whole land
"which Suane the son of Thone my grandfather, gave to
"them in Tibbermore, according to its marches, viz.  From
"the King's well on the street which comes from Perth, and
"leads to the foresaid village."  (Scillcet, a fonte Regis, qui
est super stratam quae venit de Pert, et tendit in villain prae-
fatam.)
   The King's well, is about 2 miles west from Perth, and in
the straight road to Tibbermuir.  If Perth had then been si-
tuated 2 miles up the river, and on the north of the Almonds
the road from it to Tibbermuir would have had a quite dif-
ferent direction, a great way to the north and west of the
King's well.
   I regret that I should take up so much room in Sir John
Sinclair's Publication.  But justice to the town seems to re-
quire it.  In almost all historical writing, or books of travels,
in which Perth is described, Boece's story is retailed, or al-
luded to; so that no real history of Perth can be given, till
that fable be exploded.
   It is surprising, that during the course of 270 years, no
person seems to have been at sufficient pains, to examine
what Boece had said of Perth, by comparing it with authentic
records; or at least, that no person who had done so, was
such a warm friend to truth and to the antiquities of Perth,
