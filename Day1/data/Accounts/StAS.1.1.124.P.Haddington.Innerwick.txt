male domestic servant receives L. 6 or upwards, and a female
L. 3 per annum.  Forty years ago, a male servant received
about L. 2: 10: 0, and a female L. 1: 5: 0 per annum.  Beef,
mutton, &c. are fold at Dunbar from 4 d. to 5 d. per lib.; a 
couple of fowls now costs from 2 s. to 2 s. 6 d.

   Fish, and Sea-Coast.-At present, only two fishing boats be-
longing to the parish are employed in catching lobsters, which
is by far the most profitable branch of fishing; but great va-
riety of other fish is caught, such as cod, ling, turbot, had-
dock, &c. which are generally sent to Dunfe, Haddington,
&c.  It is probable that the current on this coast is stronger
than formerly; for all the wrecks, about 15 or 16 in num-
ber, that have happened within these 18 years, have been
driven ashore nearly about the same place.  At the place
where the ships are always wrecked, there is a small creek,
called Sketraw Shore, which seems to be intended by nature
for a harbour.  The making a harbour here would be of
great advantage to the trade from Leith to London; and par-
liamentary interest could not, perhaps, be employed better
than in promoting such a scheme.

   Church and Stipend.-The church was built in 1784; the
manse about the year 1726, and repaired in 1788.  Accord-
ing to a decreet pronounced in March 1790, the stipend, in-
cluding the glebe, will, at an average, amount to L. 140 Ster-
ling per annum.  Mr Nisbet of Dirleton is patron.

   Antiquities.-The remains of a chapel are to be seen on the
coast.  There is a small encampment on Blackcastle Hill,
seemingly Danish.  There are two very beautiful tumuli, on
the top of which have been burial places.  Near one of them
is a bridge of one arch, commonly called Edirkin, said to be
