lent grazing country.  Most of the low grounds have in-
deed been inclosed with hedge and ditch, but there are
very few fences in the parish.  The grassy soil is inimical
to young thorns, and few people can be at the pains to
weed them often enough.  Perhaps it would be better to
plant hedges of beech or laryx.  Till the lands are inclo-
sed with sufficient sences, the farmers cannot well turn
their attention to green crops, a thing much to be wished.
For want of these, their cattle are fed on oat straw and
coarse hay for almost six months in the year.  The conse-
quence is, that they are quite dried up and emaciated be-
fore they get upon the grass in the month of May; and
every body knows that cattle must be in good plight, be-
fore they can yield milk either of good quality, or in any
considerable quantity.  Shelter is also much wanted here.
The Duke of Hamilton's estate in the parish consists of
upwards of 11,400 acres:  Were two or three hundred of 
these laid out in belts of plantation, as has been done in the
parish of Hamilton it would both beautify the scenery
and mend the climate.  The small plantations which have
been made by some residing heritors, and the few trees
which are about almost every farm-house, show that planta-
tions will thrive here.  Considerable improvements have
been made of late years, by draining the wet grounds, and
sowing them with Polish oats.  A deep morals in the
neighbourhood of Strathaven, which was not worth a shil-
ling the acre, has thus been brought to let at a guinea.
The grievance which the farmers here most complain of
is the tax upon saddle-horses.  Few of them can afford to
keep a horse for the purpose of riding; yet if they mount
a labouring horse on Sunday to go to church, they are
charged.  The rigorous execution of this act has done
more towards souring their minds against Government,
than all the seditious pamphlets that have been published.
