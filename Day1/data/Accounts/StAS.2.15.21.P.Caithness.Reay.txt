     sum allotted each per year, 5s.  The annual amount of contribu-
     tions for their relief is principally from church collections.  There
     is certainly a disposition among them to refrain from seeking pa-
     rochial relief; and they do consider it degrading, but sheer ne-
     cessity urges them to it.   There are no prisons.
        Fairs.-Two fairs are held at the cross of New Reay, one in
     the beginning of September, and the other in the end of Decem-
     ber; but very little business is transacted at either.
        Inns.-There are four inns or public-houses; but we are happy
     to state, that the people are now so far alive to the evils of
     whisky-drinking, and the poverty and misery attendant on in-
     temperance, as to frequent them but very seldom.
        Fuel.-The fuel commonly made use of is peat.  Every one
     cuts and prepares this for himself.
