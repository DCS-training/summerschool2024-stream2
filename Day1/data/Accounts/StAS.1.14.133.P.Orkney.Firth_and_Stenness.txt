use of putting into their master's hands, or the price of
them, at their own option.  They complain of the hin-

poor pasture, and bad roads, in case of rainy weather;
and yet they choose to pay the peats.  Some of the people

considerable sums of money.  But even they generally set
up for farmers on their return; and in a few years, are
