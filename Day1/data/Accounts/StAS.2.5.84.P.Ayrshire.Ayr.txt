lent regulation, and we are enabled to say so confidently, and to give
the above details from personal inspection. It is visited weekly by
a small committee of the goal directors, who undertae this duty in
rotation, and generally record a written report in a book kept for the
purpose, as to the state in which matters are found The two impor-
tant objects of incarceration seem to be fully accomplished in this
gaol, namely, reformation and punishment combined. As the du-
ties of the chaplain are most important, it would be desirable that
he were made strictly responsible, not to the magistrates merely
but to the county, and had a more liberal remuneration allowed.
We have been the more minute in describing this amelioration
in prison-discipline, as it is most important to the public, who, we
believe, have been much indebted for the change to Mr Charles
Fergusson, Younger of Kilkerran, and Mr Archibald Hamilton at
Rozelle-gentlemen as eminent for their personal worth, as for
their spirited exertions for the public good.

  Commitments for the last three months, ending January 837,	                60
  Remained in gaol in October 1836,              	                            22

  					    Prisoners in all,    	                      82
  Liberated during the three months,	                                        66
  Remaining in gaol in January last, of these 13 were males, 3 females,	          16
  Average number of criminal prisoners daily,	                                  17 70/92
  Greatest number at one time during last three months,	                      29
  Smallest number during three months, ending January,	                      13
  At present in prison, 16 males, 5 females,	                                  21

	The average proportion of female to male prisoners is scarcely
one-third. The prevailing crime of the former is theft,--that of
the latter theft or assault. The number of commitments seems
to be decreasing, and no capital convictions have taken place at
our Circuit Courts for many years past.
	Fairs, Spirit-shops, Fuel.--There are four fairs held in Ayr
in the course of the year, and two market-days weekly, viz. Tues-
day and Friday. The number of licensed spirit-retailers is 106,
or one to about every 70 or 80 of the population. Coal for fuel
is to be got in abundance, of good quality, and at no great dis-
tance, but it is rather high priced, costing from 11s. to 14s. per ton,
including carting.

			CONCLUDING REMARKS.
	Ayr has undergone great and important ameliorations since the
last Statistical Account was published, and if it go on improving in
the same ratio for the next thirty years, it is impossible to estimate
the degree of comparative importance to which it may arrive among
