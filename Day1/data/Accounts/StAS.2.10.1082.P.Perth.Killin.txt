though highly interesting to the passing traveller, is very alarming
to the anxious farmer. The, soil though capable of producing
good crops of oats, barley, potatoes, and turnips, is best adapted
for pasture. The hills afford the richest sheep-walks.
   Botany.-The following valuable paper, on the Botany of the
district, we owe to the able penl of Sir William Hooker.
   There is not, perhaps, in all Britain a more interesting
field for the botanist, than the vast mountain tracts of the
Breadalbane range, so large a portion of which is imbedded in the
present parish. It may, indeed, in this point of view, be looked
upon as classic ground; for here the lynx-eyed Dickson, the inde-
fatigable Don, Mackay, Stuart, (Rev. Dr, the friend of Lightfoot,
and a most important contributor to his valuable Flora Scotica,)
Turner, Borrer, Wilson, Hooker, Graham, and a host of compe-
tent students of the two professors now mentioned, have scaled
the highest peaks, and explored the deepest glens with such ar-
dour, that no part of the Highlands has been better investigated
as to its vegetable riches, than the district in question. Our li-
mits will only allow us to give a brief notice of the rarer, and es-
pecially the alpine species. *
