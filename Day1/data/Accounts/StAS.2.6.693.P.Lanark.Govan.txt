   Old Tombstone.--In 1645, + the inhabitants of this part of the
country were visited with one of those periodical irruptions of the
plague, whith formerly spread suth alarm, and produced suth
fearful mortality over the whole island. Business was at a stand
in many places. The ordinary intercourse of life was suspended.
Nor could the accustomed rites of burial be attended to by those
who, by a law of harsh necessity, were shut out from the sym-
pathy and friendly offices of the world, and by a rdgard to their
own safety, unwillingly compelled, almost as soon as life was ex-
tinct, to bury their dead out of their sight. There can be little
doubt, therefore, that the aged throniclers of the neighbouring
village are right when they represent an old grave-stone that still
may be seen, as designed to mark the spot where a victim of the
plague was hurriedly buried. This unambitious monument lies
'flat upon the ground, near the east side of a field, whith forms
part of the farm of Laigh Craigton, and not more than half a mile
south from the parish thurth. It contains this simple intimation,

CRAIGTON, WHO DECEASED THE 7 OF MARth 1645, OF THE
AGE 15.
