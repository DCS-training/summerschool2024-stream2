its station over the corpse, and made a part of a fence about
a field of corn; where it is denominated the Acquavitae Stone.
To account for this appellation, and to prevent antiquarians
from puzzling their brains with dark and learned hypotheses
in time to come, it may not be improper to tell, that the
men, whose brawny strength removed this venerable tenant,
finding it rather a hard piece of work, got, as a solace for
their soil, a pint of whisky, out of which, immediately,
around the stone, they took a hearty dram.  Every body
knows, that, in Scotland, whisky and aquavitae are the same.
   4.  A square bit of ground, almost covered with whins,
into which multitudes of the dead were tumbled.  This is
very near the north-west corner of the fir-park of Tomna-
muid, and about 120 yards or so from the above stone, almost
directly south.
   5.  The length of Malcolm's spear added to the church,
at the west end, in performance of a part of his vow.  It
has been the spear of a Goliah, 23 or 24 feet long.
   6.  Three holes, exactly of the shape of skulls, in this ad-
ditional and votive part of the house, yet to be seen; where
the heads of three Danes of distinction had, with too barba-
rous a triumph, been originally built in the wall.  At what-
ever time, or in whatever way, three skulls may have first
been put there, there they surely were; and, not longer than
about 30 years ago, was the last of them picked out, and
tossed about by the school boys.
   7.  A standing stone on the glebe, having on two of its
opposite sides some rude and unintelligible sculpture.
   Human bones, broken sabres, and other military armour,
have been at different times accidentally discovered in this
part of the country: And in plowing the glebe, about 40 or
50 years ago, there was a chain of gold turned up, which
looked like an ornament for the neck of one of the chiefs.
