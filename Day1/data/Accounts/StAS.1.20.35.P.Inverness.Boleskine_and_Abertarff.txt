pleasure and admiration in many improved districts of Scot-
land.
   This parish, being situated in a part of the great opening
betwixt the west and the sea, denominated of old Glenn-
more-na-h'alabin, or the Large Glen of Caledonia.  It may
not be impertinent to this subject, to notice, the evident pub-
lic utility that would result, by opening a communication, by
water, betwixt the Murray Frith at Inverness and the
branch of the Western Ocean at Fort-William.  The Author
of Nature seems to have intended this as a practicable meas-
sure: the distance, taken in a straight direction, does not much

rations, would, in process of time, redound more to the na-
tional advantage, than the sporting thereof in speculative
schemes on transalantic plantations, liable to the destructive
inroads of Charibs, etc. etc.
   We cannot entertain a doubt, that it must be the blame of
the heritors, if the tenantry of this parish, so near to inex-

with confidence affirm, that this mode can alone restore the
decrease of population of this country, which falls in course
of our plan now to be stated.
