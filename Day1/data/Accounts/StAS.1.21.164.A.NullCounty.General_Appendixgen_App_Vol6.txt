length, by floating off the moss down to the clay.
   This being effected, and at the same time an opening gi-

for eight acres of High Moss each.  In consideration of the
greater depth of this part of the moss, it was agreed, that
during the first 19 years they should pay no rent; but for
the second 19 years the terms of agreement were the same

plan adopted by his predecessor for subduing the moss.  At
this time there still remained undisposed of about 1000 acres
of High Moss.  As water was the great desideratum, it was
