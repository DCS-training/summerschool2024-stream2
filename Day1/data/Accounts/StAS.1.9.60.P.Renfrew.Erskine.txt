     Statiscal Account

lies over whin rock.  There are 6 or 7 farms in the south-east
part of the parish, which are situated along the edge of, or
within an extensive tract of flat or carse ground, a great part
of which is covered with peat moss, and has probably been
all so.  The soil of these farms is a deep clay, and abundant-
ly fertile.  It may also be observed, that forest trees thrive
well in many places of the parish, particularly in the neigh-
bourhood of the Clyde.-There is no lake nor river in the
parish; the boundaries of it are for the most part marked
out by small streams or burns.  The Clyde, which washes
the northern edge, is in breadth, when the tide is full, from
about a quarter of a mile at the east, to above a mile and a
half at the west end of the parish.  The ground immedi-
ately adjoining to the Clyde is every where flat.  The
breadth of this plain is various; at one place, (hence call-
ed Longhaugh), it may be near a quarter of a mile; but in
most places, it is not above the half or fourth part of that
extent.  Behind the plain, the bank generally rises pretty
suddenly to a considerable heighth.  As the Clyde has
such a wide bed, land floods seldom raise it very consider-
ably, unless a strong S. W. wind, and a high tide occur
at the same time. In that case, some of the low grounds are
covered, but seldom any remarkalbe mischief is done.-
There are some freestone quarries in the eastern part of
the parish.  Two of them in one of Lord Blantyre's parks
have been wrought of late for the great canal, and for
building new quays for the ferry.  Some appearances of
coal have been discovered in these grounds, but they have
never been properly pursued.  The hills in the west part
of the parish are in general green; the tops of them only
are covered with heath.
