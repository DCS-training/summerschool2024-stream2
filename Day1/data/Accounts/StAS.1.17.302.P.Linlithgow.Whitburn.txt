beginning of May.  There is little more meal made than
what is used in the parish, the farmers generally thinking it
more advantageous to dispose of their oats to the public-
houses in their neighbourhood.  The oats produce from 9
to 13 pecks of meal from the boll.  Both string time and
harvest are generally wet.

   Ecclesiastical State of the Parish.-There are three clergy-
men in the parish; the ministers of the Established Church,
of the Burgher, and of the Antiburgher congregations.  To
the Established Church there adheres about a third part of
the parish.  To the Burgher congregation belongs by far
the greater part of the remaining two thirds.  Only a few
individuals of this parish belong to the Antiburgher congre-
gation, the rest of its members coming from West Calder,
and other parishes.
   Perhaps the following circumstances may, in some mea-
sure, at least, account for the great proportion of Seceders in
this parish.  Whiteburn was formerly part of the parish of
Livingston; but was disjoined from it, and erected into a
separate parish, anno 1730.  The erection was made in con-
sequence of a sum of money having been raised, by a volun-
tary subscription over all Scotland, which, after building a
church and manse, and purchasing ground for a glebe, was
thought sufficient, by its yearly produce, for the maintenance
of a parish minister.  Several of the heritors were liberal in
subscribing, active in procuring subscriptions, and zealous in
carrying on the process of erection before the Court of
Teinds, from entertaining the idea, that the minister was to
be chosen by the parish at large.  The patron of Living-
ston, however, was found, by the House of Lords, to be ex
necessitate, patron of Whiteburn, which had been disjoined
from it.  And this gave such universal offence in the parish,
as threw the greater part of it, gradually, into the Secession.
