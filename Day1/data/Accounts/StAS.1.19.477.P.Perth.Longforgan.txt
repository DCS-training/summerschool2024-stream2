   Sold in 1615 to The Family of Lyon.-In 1615, this castle,
with the estate belonging to it, passed from the family of
Gray to the family of Lyon, the Earls of Kinghorn, and
Earl Patrick succeeding sometime about the year 1660, it
became a favourite residence of his.  Whether any altera-
tions had been made upon the castle before his time, does
not appear.  But many alterations and additions were made
by him, all of which bore his initials, and the date 1667.
One very remarkable alteration made by him was enlar-
ging the dining room, by digging four feet out of the front
wall for its whole length of 34 feet; so that, while the wall
of the rooms, both above and below, are 10 feet thick, the
front wall of this room is only 6 feet thick; and when the
castle was repairing in 1778, the upper part of this exca-
vation was found to project and hang over, like a solid im-
penetrable rock.

   Name changed to Lyon in 1672.-By the fame charter,
which Earl Patrick obtained from Charles II. 1672, in

finding no proper bed to found upon, arches were thrown from point to point
of the rock for that purpose.  As no coal-ashes were found, may not this be
an additional proof of its great antiquity'
   The most ancient part of the building is very distinguishable from the rest,
as all the stones are placed on the same bed as they lay in the quarry; and
it would appear from the openings made on the walls, for different pur-
poses, by the present proprietor, that the old castle had been built of two
walls, one outside, of very large massy stones, tolerably well dressed; and an
Inner wall, not quite so well dressed: That the middle space between
these had then been filled up with immense large whin-stones, gathered
from the fields, with smaller stones thrown in loosely round them, and then
filled up with grouted lime, that is, lime mixed with a proper proportion of
sand, and made so thin with water, as to admit of being poured in, and to
fill up all the cavities between the stones.  This cement is now so very hard,
that it is much more difficult to work than any quarry; so much so, that in
1793, when making an opening for a window of 9 1/2 feet by 4 1/2, and only
6 feet thick, as the wall had been thinned before, it was hard work to four
stout men for nine days
