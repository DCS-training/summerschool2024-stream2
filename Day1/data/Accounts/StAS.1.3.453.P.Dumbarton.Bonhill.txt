some farms, whereof they are still in possession of the supe-
riority, along with considerable feu duties.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The oldest inhabitant at pre-
sent in this parish, is a man of 87 years of age.-There are
two licenced distillers in it.-The woods are famous for the
number of woodcocks that frequent them during winter;
and the river and lake for a great variety of sea sowl.  In se-
vere seasons swans frequent the lake.-Inchmarin, one of the
islands in Lochlomond, is at an equal distance from the pa-
rishes of Bonhill, Luss, Kilmarnock, and Buchanan.  Some
parts of Lennoxshire, now Dumbartonshire, were formerly
annexed to Stirlingshire.  From this circumstances, it is not
determined to what county it belongs; and as it pays so sti-
pend, it is equally undetermined to what parish.  It is the
largest island in the lake; is about 2 miles long, and from
half a mile to one mile broad.  It is beautiful, and finely
wooded.  The Montrose family use it as a deer park, where
they keep about 200 sallow deer.  The ruins of the castle,
formerly belonging to the Lennox family, are still upon this
Island.  The person, who has the charge of the woods and
the deer, resides with his family upon it.  Some years ago,
many persons disordered in their senses, were sent to it as to
a place of consinement; and those of the fair sex, who were 
to unfortunate as to give pregnant proofs of their frailty,
were rent here to avoid the reproach of the world.  At that
time the neighbouring clergyman, who happened to be a
strict disciplinarian, and very zealous against fornicators,
claimed Inchmarin as belonging to his charge:  But owing to
complaints of abuse, the proprietor, for some time past, has
not allowed his sorrester to take lodgers.
