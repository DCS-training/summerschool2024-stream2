   The above account of births, corresponds with an observa-
tion made by the Baron de Montesquieu, in his Spirit of Laws,
that there are born, in several parts of Europe, more boys
than girls.

   Manufactures.-The inhabitants of this parish enjoy the
advantages of raising, watering, dressing, and spinning of
flax, in a high degree, which might surely be an object of
great importance, both to flax dealers and manufacturers;
though, as yet, there is no established linen manufactory in
the parish.  For some years past, there has been a small
brick-work carried on; but it does not appear, that this
branch of manufacture has either enriched its proprietor, or
much benefited the parishioners.  Several houses have been
built within these last 10 years for tradesmen, especially wea-
vers, who have met with due encouragement from the far-
mers.  They are allowed a piece of ground nigh to their
houses, on reasonable terms; and are bound to perform no
services, except a few day's labour, at different seasons of the
year, during which time they receive, from their respective
masters, 6 d. per day, and their victuals.  It is probable that 
these persons, from their industry, economy, and attention to
business, will increase the produce, the wealth, and the po-
pulation of the parish.  There is one brewer in this parish,
and 4 persons who sell ale and spirituous liquors, and are known
by the name of tapsters.  These alehouses are rather for the 
accomodation of strangers, than for the use of the parishi-
oners, who look upon idleness, debauchery, and intemperance,
as the principal sources of human misery.

   Fuel.-The fuel, commonly used by the inhabitants in the
lower part of the parish, is coal, and by those in the higher
part, peats and turf.
