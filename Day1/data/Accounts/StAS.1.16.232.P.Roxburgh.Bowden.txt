thorns, which thrive well when properly taken care of.
The foil of far the greatest part is a white binding clay on
a tilly bottom, which retains moisture, becomes hard in
drought, and can only be laboured and sown to advantage
when the season is neither too wet nor too dry.  About
1-6th of it is well adapted to wheat; another 1-6th is
sharp, lets water easily sink, is very manageable, and
produces good turnips, corn, and grass.  Most of the parish
is, on the whole, as well suited to pasturage as to tillage,
and will pay as well.  The exposure in general is high and
easterly, which, together with the clayey soil, renders the
crops often late, precarious, and apt to suffer much from
rainy harvests and early frosts.  In the 1782, a great deal
of corn was uncut at Martinmas, and several farmers, in-
stead of paying their rents from their crops, were obliged
to purchase grain.  Many oats yielded that year no more
than 3 stone of meal per boll.

   Farms, Rents, Heritors.-The farms are very unequal,
paying L. 400, L. 200, L. 100, L. 70, L. 60, and even so
low as L. 10, and L. 8 Sterling of yearly rent in money,
besides a few carriages, one half of the poors-rates, and one
half of the schoolmaster's salary.  The soil differing greatly
in value, lands, in farms, are let at from 15 s. to 5 s. per
acre.  Some small fields near the villages of Middleham
and Bowden are rented for conveniency for L. 1, 10 s. per
acre, while some tracts of outfield high lands do not fetch
above 2 s. 6 s.  The whole real rent of the parish may at
present amount to L. 2300 Sterling.  The valued rent is
L. 8030, 11 s. Scots*; of which the largest half belongs to
the Duke of Roxburgh, his valuation being L. 412l, 11 s.
