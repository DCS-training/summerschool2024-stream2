thor's opinion, without reason.  They censure indiscriminate-
ly every deviation from ancient practice, not as being culpa-
ble, but new; and they reprobate, with unmerited appella-
tions, certain modes of conduct, which indicate only an ad-
vanced state of civilization.  Thus, changes that are prescrib-
ed by fashion, and the manners of the times, are termed ex-
travagance and affectation; coversation somewhat enlarged,
or any attempt to deviate, in discourse, from their own bar-
barous phraseology, are imitations of the talk and manners of
gentlemen; an advance towards improvement, by any new
mode of agriculture, is an innovation that cannot be practised
successfully; and the demand of written security for money,
is an indication of distrust, that is inconsistent with ancient
simplicity and confidence, when individuals demanded no o-
ther security for small sums, than a verbal promise of pay-
ment.  These changes have their origin, partly in the larger
and more diversified intercourse of society, and partly in the
more universal diffusion of property, of which men are natu-
rally rendered more careful, as they become more sensible of its
value, and are benefited by those advantages, of which it placeth
them in possession.  Perhaps, indeed, progress in agriculture
has not kept pace with other branches of improvement.  Yet,
if the latter shall go forward, in the succeeding, as in the
present century, some corresponding advancement must be
made on the former; as men will find, in the melioration of
their farms, the only resource, whereby expence, that will
become unavoidable, can be supported.
