     of Banchory Davinick.

   Population.-At the time of Dr Webster's report, the
numbers were 1495.  The population at present amounts
to about 1700.  Of these 1700, no more than 744 are
males, which leaves 956 females.  I suppose this dispropor-
tion will be found to be greatest in country parishes in the
vicinity of large towns.

   Stipend, Poor, etc.-The stipend at present, amounts to
no more than L. 54: 2: 3 1/2 Sterling, 42 bolls 1 peck of
meal, and 24 bolls 1 peck of bear; in which is included
communion element money, and L. 16 Scots allowed for
grass carried off by the river.  The glebe is very little
above the legal minimum.  There are 10 heritors, 3 of
whom reside.-The number of poor who are supplied
quarterly, are from 20 to 30, besides a good many who re-
ceive occasional aid.  Our funds consist of L. 5 Sterling,
appropriated by a special deed for that purpose, out of the
rents of the estate of Banchory, L. 3: 6: 8 out of those of
Ardo, a piece of ground which yields L. 6 of free rent,
and the interest of L. 25 of stocked money; besides our
weekly collections, so much for the use of the parish mort-
cloth, and so much for the use of the burying-ground,
exacted from every person who uses it, and who does not
reside in the parish, and such fines or penalties as are levied
from fornicators, etc.  From all these sources together, we
have an annual income of L. 45 Sterling at an average.
I cannot help here expressing a wish, in which I am by no
means singular, that fornicators and other scandalous per-
sons were entirely turned over to the secular arm.  Our
discipline has no effect to check the evil, and exposes us to
witness very disagreeable scenes of equivocation, falsehood,
and perjury.
