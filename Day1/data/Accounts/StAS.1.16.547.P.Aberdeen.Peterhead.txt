two villages; the two branches unite in one stream about
five miles from this place, and then take the name of Ugie.
The tide flows about a mile and a half up this river, as far
as the bridge of Inverugie, which is very neat, consisting of
two arches, and was considered of such importance to this
country, as to obtain an act of Parliament for its erection in
the reign of James VII.  Small coasting vessels may enter
the river with the tide, and sometimes come in, but very
seldom; it might, however, be easily rendered navigable, at
least a canal might be made to communicate with the river.
Such a plan has been in contemplation, the expence has
been calculated by engineers, and I am informed it might
be executed so as to reach a village in the centre of a very
fertile and populous part of the country, about 10 miles
from the sea, at a less sum than L. 4000; but no exertions
have yet been made to carry this into effect, though the
proprietors of the ground through which the canal must
pass, are in very affluent circumstances, and by means of it
the greatest advantages would accrue to a large district of
their property.  In this parish there are several small ri-
vulets or streams of water running in different directions,
in which there are a few trouts and eels; from these rills,
or small burns, four mills are supplied with water for grind-
ing grain into meal and malt, and there is one mill on the
Ugie for the same purpose; there is one windmill near the
town of Peterhead, on a small eminence, for grinding malt,
and which lately, by a small addition to the machinery,
strikes pot (pearl) barley.

   Salmon, etc.-In the water of Ugie there are salmon of
an excellent quality.  There are seldom caught before the
month of April, and from that time till the first of July are
in greatest perfection.  There are great varieties of fine
trout, finnocks eels, minnows, and flounders in the river.
