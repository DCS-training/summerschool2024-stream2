the parties are unable to pay it.  If they would adhere to
this alternative, the laws would be restored to their proper
efficacy, and this branch of their jurisdiction would soon af-
ford them very little employment.  But while they assume
powers, with which they do not seem to me to be entrusted
by the laws of their country, I am under a necessity of con-
sidering them as a acting in there instances, not as the guar-
dians of order, but as the perverters of the law, and the
promoters of confusion.  We have here some justices of
speedy growth; but I Would be wanting in candour, if I
did not acknowlege, that the real gentlemen of this county
have in general considered it as beneath the dignity of their
character to take any concern in irregular marriages, that
they uniformly refuse such applications, and that when such
applications have been made to them, their good advice
has often prevailed with the parties to have recourse to the
forms which the laws of the country prescribe.
   As to the register of baptisms, no trouble has been spared
to render it correct.  The two parochial ministers seldom
baptise a child, without causing the parent bring an attesta-
tion, that he has paid for having his child's name registered;
and the minister of the Chapel of Ease keeps an accurate
list of the children baptised by him, which he sends annual-
ly to the session-clerk.  Several persons are also employed
to procure information of those who are baptised by dissent-
ing clergymen of different denomination.  Notwithstanding
all this care, several baptisms annually occur, which are not
recorded.  Besides, the children of a very few Quakers who
are never baptised, and some who are either born dead, or die
so soon after their birth that they cannot be baptised, can-
not be mentioned in the register of baptisms.  The annual
births in the parish must therefore exceed the numbers
stated in the tables, I suppose, by a dozen at least.
