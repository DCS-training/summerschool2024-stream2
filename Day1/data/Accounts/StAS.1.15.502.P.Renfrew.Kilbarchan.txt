Even if it were thought too laborious to gather all the stones
they might admit cattle to pasture in the dry season, as soon
as the grass was sufficiently rooted.  The ground commonly
lies 4 or 5 years in pasture.  Potatoes are sometimes planted
in lazy beds, on spots here and there among the rocks; some-
times with the plough; after potatoes, sometimes barley,
sometimes oats.  There are many fields well adapted for
turnips, which have never been tried.  The lands are mostly

The rent cannot be estimated by acres, as the land lies in

the several proprietors bound in thirlage, and the interest of
