     Statistical Account

   By this it appears there has been an increase of 5 houses in
Burness parish, and the isle of North Ronaldshay, from April
1787 to April 1791; and that there has been a decrease of
3 houses in Crosskirk parish, which makes the increase on
the whole only 2.
   The number of houses in Ladykirk parish, when last num-
bered by the last incumbent's assistant in August 1787, were
155.  They have probably increased 4 or 5 since that time.
   By this it appears, that the proportion of persons to a
house is little more than 5 to each house, or family, in all
the other parishes except North Ronaldshay, where the po-
pulation has been increasing; and there they are rather more
than 6 to a house or family.  If it is wished to ascertain the
exact proportion in each of the parishes, it is as follows:
