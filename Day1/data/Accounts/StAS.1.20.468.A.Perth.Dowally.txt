   Black-Cattle.-Their number amounts to 506.  Their
average weight, when fat, is about 16 stone; and their price
from L. 5 to L. 6 Sterling. They give 5 pints of milk a
day.  Few are reared for sale.  Calves, sold at 3 days old,
bring 6s.; and if kept for 3 weeks, from 15 s. to L. 1 Ster-
ling.  When rearing, they are allowed 4 pints of milk a
day; and at times get a smaller quantity of milk, and in
lieu of the remainder some bay-tea.
   The breed of black-cattle here requires improvement;
but while the practice of overstocking prevails, and there is
a deficiency of winter and spring food, this improvement is
impracticable.  Both of these obstacles will, it is hoped, soon
be removed.  As a proof, however, that they still operate,
and check the spirit which should actuate the farmers, it
was found, that no bull was sent from this district as a com-
petitor for the premium allowed by the Highland Society,
to the proprietor of the best bull which should be produced
there.

   Sheep.-There are 2350 sheep in the parish, of a small
white-faced breed.  The time of their introduction into this
part of the country is uncertain; but from tradition it ap-
pears to be remote.  They are said to have prevailed before
the black-faced sheep were brought into the north of Scot-
land.  When fat, their mutton is delicious.  Their wool is
short and fine; sells from 16 s. to L. 1 Sterl. per stone.  The
wedders and aged ewes are sold at annual fair held at
Kilmorich, a village in the parish, and bring about 7 s.  No
cheese is ever made here from ewe milk.  The whole sheep
belonging to the parish feed promiscuously on the hill.
They are driven to that pasture at the beginning of summer,
are are brought back to the low grounds after harvest,
where they have been permitted, from the want of inclo-
sures, to wander at large through the woods, and over the
