orphans, left destitute and helpless, and rendered a heavy bur-
den on the parish. The expenses of the Board of Health, dur-
ing its prevalence, amounted to L. 742,3s. of which L. 165, 13s.
were raised by subscription, and L. 576, 10s. by an extra assess-
ment. In addition to this, the ordinary assessment for the year that
followed was necessarily raised from L. 570 to L. 950, and al-
though some reduction has taken place of this heavy burden, yet
the directors have never been able, with their utmost efforts, to
bring it back to any thing near to what it previously was. It may
possibly be thought by some, from the system of directorship which
we have exhibited above, that we have deviated too much from
Scotch parochial simplicity in our management of the poor, and
that the machinery is too complex to admit of vigorous efficiency.
Whether it be so or not, we shall not take upon us to decide, but
it is proper to mention, that all who have a share in this manage-
ment are alike anxious to lessen the evil and the grievous burden
which pauperism has entailed on this parish. The following state
will exhibit in one view the progress of the assessment since the be-
ginning of the present century; and we shall mention only the
years when any alteration took place.

	Dispensary.--This very useful institution was formed in the
year 1817, and it has proved a blessing to many thousands of the
poor of the community, by administering medical advice and relief
gratuitously to all labouring tnder disease, or requiring surgical
aid, whose means could not enable them to pay the usual fees of
a medical practitioner. In fact, it may be regarded as the most
beneficial establishment of the place. Upwards of 500 yearly are
enrolled on the list of its patients--every subscriber to the amount
of 5s. annually being entitled to recommend one to participate
of its benefits. It comprehends within its sphere the three parishes
of Ayr, Newton, and Wallacetown, and it has been hitherto sup-
ported wholly by voluntary contributions. The average expendi-
ture amounts to more than L. 100 a-year, but this has as yet been
met by the income arising from subscriptions and donations; and
so sensible are the community in general of its usefulness, that an
extension of their liberality could doubtless be easily procured to
supply any deficiency of funds. Five medical gentlemen in Ayr
at present officiate as surgeons; and the whole of the three parishes
