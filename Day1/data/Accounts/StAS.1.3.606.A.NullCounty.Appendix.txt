   Soil, Climate, F el, etc.-The soil adjacent to the river is
partly a light loan, and partly gravelly; on the rising ground,
and towards the hills, the soil is a deep till mixed with moss.
The ground next the hills is composed, partly of muir unfit
for tillage, some of which is already planted with fir; and
partly of moss of a good quality, and which is now the only
fuel of the inhabitants, paring the ground for the turf being
prohibited by the present and only proprietor, William
Drummond, Esq.  Rains are frequent, by reason of its prox-

with which they are pretty much visited, they have very high
winds, especially from the west, which, collected in, and

   Agriculture, etc.-All the arable ground was run-rigg till
last year, which greatly retarded, or rather quite prevented,
improvement; but the present proprietor has wisely abolish-
ed the practice.  He has divided all the lands into small
compact farms, containing from 20 to 40 acres each, with
the laudable intention of providing for all his old tenants,
and such of their sons as incline to agriculture.  He has al-
ready, within the space of one year, at considerable expence,
reared up to 20 neat convenient farm houses, built with stones.
Two of these houses are of two stories, and garrets; the rest
