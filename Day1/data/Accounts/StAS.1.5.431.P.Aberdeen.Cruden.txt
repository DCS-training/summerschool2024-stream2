     NUMBER XXX.

     PARISH OF CRUDEN,

     (COUNTY OF ABERDEEN.)

     By the Rev. Mr ALEXANDER COCK.

     Origin of the Name.

   CRUDEN, OR CRUDANE, as it is spelled in old records,
takes its rise from the famous battle, which was
sought in the beginning of the 11th century, between Mal-
colm II. and Canute, the son of Sueno, who was after-
wards King of England, Denmark, Norway, and part
of Sweden.  The armies met about a mile to the west of
Slains castle, the family seat of the Earl of Errol, upon a
plain in the bottom of the bay of Ardendraught*, near
which the Danes then had a castle, the ruins of which are
still to be seen.  The Scots had the victory.  The night
succeeding the battle, both parties lay at a small distance

<FOOTNOTE>

*A considerable portion of the Earl of Errol's estate is called the
barony of Ardendraught, a name which is said to signify the Old Danish
Roads.
