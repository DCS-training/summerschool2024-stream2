ing in some places over rocks; there are clumps of forest
trees almost at every farm house.  But what contributes
most of all to the rural beauty of this place, is, that the Earl
of Moray has, within the last twenty years, inclosed and
planted. in the different places, at least 500 acres of what was
till then bleak and barren heath.  These plantations con-
sisted at first almost entirely of Scots firs; but, as the firs
grew up, they were weeded and thinned, to make room
for trees of a more valuable kind, chiefly oaks, which thrive
amazingly well, to which the sirs serve as a shelter.  While
these plantations thus decorate the country, the weedings are
of some use to the inhabitants for firing and other purposes.

   Air, Climate, and Diseases.-The air in this part of the coun-
try is serene, and the climate dry.  Though the ground in 
general is rather flat and low, there are no marshes nor stag-
nating water in it, to occasion noxious vapours.  The high
hills in the neighbourhood attract the clouds, especially dur-
ing the summer months, so that this parish suffers frequent-
ly by excessive drought at that season of the year, while
places at no great distance have no reason of complaint on
that account.
   The people of this place are not liable to any peculiar lo-
cal diseases, but are in general as healthy as their neighbours.
As they have not yet been prevailed upon to innoculate for
the small-pox, when a malignant kind of that disease pre-
vails, which generally happens once in five or six years, it
sweeps away a number of children.
   This parish cannot be accounted remarkable for the longe-
vity of its inhabitants.  There are at present a few persons
in it above 80 years old; several above 70; and many near
that age.
