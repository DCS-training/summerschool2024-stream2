Roag.  The Flannan Isles lie in a north-west direction from
Gallan-head, about 12 or 15 miles in the ocean; they are
not inhabited, and are famous for fattening sheep, each of
which have always at a time two lambs every season.  The
islands are seven in number, and are the same which Bu-
channan calls Insulae Sacrae, because they seem to have been
the residence of ecclesiastics in time of the druids; some
of their temples, built without any mortar, are still extant.
Sheep brought from those isles do not live for any time on
the continent of Lewis.  The people of the farms to which
the isles are connected, go there once a-year to fleece their
sheep, and to kill sea-fowls, both for food, and on account
of their feathers.  In the islands there is to be found, in the
summer season, a migratory bird, called by Martin colk,
by others edder duck, famous for its elastic down, which it
plucks off its own breast, and with which it lines the nest.-
Loch Roag, being the only one worthy of particular notice,
is two leagues across at the entry, and runs up in a south-
east direction about 12 miles through the island.  This
loch is covered with islands, several of them inhabited, and
one of them is about eight miles long; its name is Large
Bernera.  The whole of this curious loch abounds with
safe places of anchorage, sufficient to hold the whole Bri-
tish navy, nay, I may say the navy of Europe.  The
whole parish is covered with heath, except the inhabited
grounds at the sea-side.
