of singular service in making such an alteration is the lime-stone
and coal, with which this parish abounds.  The soil differs
very much through the whole parish; and though some very
good grain is produced, (especially on the farms to the north-
ward of the church), yet, in general, it is better adapted for
pasturage.  The proprietors are so sensible of this, that more
than one half of the parish, which was all open fields 30 years
ago, is now inclosed; and similar improvements are daily
making upon the rest of it.

   Farm Rents, Prices of Labour, etc.-Rents are considerably
raised within these 30 years.  All the farms, of which leases
have been lately granted, produce to the proprietor double,
and some of them triple, of what they did formerly.  The price
of labour, in some measure, keeps pace with the rents.  Tailors,
whose wages were no more than 4 d. per day, demand 10 d.
masons, who used to work for a merk, (13 s. 4 d. Scotch), look for
1 s. 8 d. Ster.; day labourers cannot be got under 1 s.; common
ploughmen have raised their wages, from 40 s. and a pair of
shoes, to 5 l. Sterling; and they who sow and bigg, expect 7
guineas.  Women servants, who used to be satisfied with 20 s.
in the year, will not now engage under 2 l. 10 s. at the lowest,
and few can be got under 3 l.  The article of coals is very much
advanced in price within these 40 years: A cart load at the
hill cost only 1 s. 4 d.; but now, for the same quantity, 3 s.,
and sometimes 3 s. 6 d. is paid.  Indeed, it must be owned,
that the expence of working coal is greatly increased.  Two
fire engines are employed for that purpose, in this parish, by
Mr. DURHAM Of LARGO, and the coal-hewers receive more
wages.  Adjacent to one of these fire engines, he has lately.
created a number of houses to accommodate the workmen.
