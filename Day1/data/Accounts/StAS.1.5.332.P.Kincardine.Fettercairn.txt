   Prices of Provisions, Wages, and Fuel.-Beef and mutton
fell at from 3 d. to 4 d, per l b.; oat-meal from 12 s. to 15 s.
per boll; butter 6 d. to 8 d. per l b.- The wages of men
servants, are from L. 5, 10 s, to L. 7; of women servants,
L. 3 to L. 3, 10 s.; masons and wrights get 1 s. per day,
besides meat; tailors, 8 d.- The fuel, is chiefly turf from
the hills, and peats from the low mosses.  Coals from Mon-
trose, cost from 8 s. 6 d. to 9 s. per boll, (70 stone Dutch
weight), besides carriage.  The price of this necessary article
is very high, from the duty levied on coals carried coast-
wise, which is hurtful to manufactures, and is justly com-
plained of by all ranks.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The King is patron.  The stipend,
as stated in the decreet, is L. 83: 6: 8; part is paid in
victual, but the greatest part in money; besides a glebe of
6 acres, including grass.  The manse was rebuilt in 1774.
The church is a very old house, too narrow for its length,
as most of these old kirk are.- The poor in the parish are nu-
merous.  Their chief support comes from the collections
after worship on the Lord's day, and the money arising
from the use of the mortcloth.  The failure of crop 1782,
increased their number.  Some savings, which were then in
the box, were employed in purchasing meal; but the effects
of that, and the following year, are still felt.  The only do-
nation, lately given to the poor here, is L.50 Sterling by
Provost Alexander Christie, of Montrose.  The interest, is
to be distributed in the month of January every year.
