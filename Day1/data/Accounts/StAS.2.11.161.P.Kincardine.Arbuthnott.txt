from the farm of Craighill, a similar one was found, containing
ashes; but it was broken accidentally by the blow of a pick-axe.
Near the Hogs-hole, from which the large deer horns, already
noticed, were dug up, a stone hatchet, and the metal head of a
battle-axe, were found. The head of a smaller battle-axe wag
thrown up about two years ago, in digging a drain on the farm of
Townhead. It appears to be composed of a mixture of copper and
tin, and weighs 8 1/4 oz Avoirdupois.
	Proprietors' Residences.--Arbuthnott House. The lawn and the
approach have been greatly improved and beautified by the pre-
sent Viscount. The new approach is connected with the mansion
by a stone bridge of the finest architecture, thrown across the

of Kair is quite a modern mansion, of considerable beauty.
