                  No family of distinction or of independent fortune resides in the
               parish, and of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and
               upwards,-there are six.
                   Character, &c. of the People.-The people in general are of the
               middle stature, and well-proportioned, having brown or yellow hair.
               Their features are rather small than otherwise, of an agreeable
               expression, and have nothing of that harshness which is characte-
               ristic of the Anglo-Saxon descent. Both sexes manifest an insati-
               able curiosity for prying into the concerns of others; and with an
               acuteness scarcely to be credited, and a perseverance worthy of a
               better object. When the direct question and sly insinuation have
               failed, nothing daunted they will renew their efforts, and, if still
               unsuccessful, they will substitute their own conjectures for the in-
               formation  withheld.
                  They are hospitable to a proverb, and would share their last
               morsel with their neighbour, or even with a stranger whom they
               bad never before seen. They have a great volubility of speech,
               and are no mean adepts in flattery, when they think it will promote
               their particular views. Though many carry their passion for dress
               to an unbecoming and even an extravagant length, it gives me
               much pleasure to bear testimony to their general sobriety of con-
               duct, and attention to the external ordinances of religion. They
               may, with truth, be said tobe a churchgoing people, and I trust
               many of them have felt the power of religion, are living under its
               imfluence, "and asking the way to Zion with their faces thither-
               ward."

                  Arable Lands.-There are 777 merks of arable lands in these
               united parishes; but the extent of a merk of land cannot now be as-
               certained. Originally it must have been very small, and have com-
