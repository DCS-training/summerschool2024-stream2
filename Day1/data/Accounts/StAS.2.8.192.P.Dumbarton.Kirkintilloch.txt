judge from the plans, the building will be at once elegant and
commodious, and will add not a little to the picturesque beaty of
the district.-Major Berry has an elegant and commodious seat
near the town of Kirkintilloch, and many fine villas and
manor houses of wealthy and respectable individuals are scat-
tered in different parts of the parish. Owing to the gradual
dismemberment of the Wigton estate, which, at one period, ex-
tended over many neighbouring parishes, the propert has been
very equally distributed, and is now in the hands of a great many
proprietors. In this respect, it may be considered as a model of
a parish so circumstanced, and it may therefore not be improper to
give an analysis of the present state of property, so as to make
figures speak, instead of words.
   In the roll of the real valuation of the parish, there are no less
than 311 proprietors of lands and houses, so that every nineteenth
person nearly is possessed of some heritable property. The num-
ber of female proprietors is 52, with a gross yearly income of
L.839, 7s. 10d. It may not be uninteresting to observe the pro-
portion in which this considerable sum is distributed among them.
The constitute nearly one-sixth of the whole proprietors, but the
proportion of their gross yearly income is only about one-twentieth.
The numerals indicate the number of individuals, and the sums
their annual income from property. They are put down promiscu-
ously as they occur on the roll.
