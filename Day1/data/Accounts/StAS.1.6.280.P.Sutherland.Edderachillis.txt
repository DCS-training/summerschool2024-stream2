   Ecclesiastical State.-Besides the parish church, there is a
place appointed for public worship, and at the distance of six
miles from it, on the N. side of the kyle of Inchard in Ashir,
where it is the incumbent's duty to officiate once in six weeks;
but as the parish church is situated as commodiously as it pos-
sibly could be, and pretty centically upon the coast, the at-
tendance of the parishoiners there, especially in good wea-

easily from almost the most distant parts of the parish.-The
church has undergone two several reparations within the last
20 years; has a slated roof; is well-seated; and very way fit
for the accommodation of the parishioners.  The manse has
also been twice repaired within the above time: it and some
of the offices have also slated roof, as all the houses in the coun-
try ought to have, for nothing else can stand the violence of
the weather.-Upon the first establishment of the parish, the
minister had 800 merks for his stipend, together with 40
merks for communion elements: but a reduction of it after-

the church of Scotland with consent of the then incumbent,
with Lord Reay; in whose hand they seatled the whole mo-
ney collected*, as a fund for paying part of the stipends of the
parishes of Tongue, Diurness, and Ldderachyhs, at the rate
of 4 1/2 per cent.  The portion of that collection assigned to this
parish was 11400 merks Scotch; the interest of which sum
being L. 28:10, together with L. 15 yearly out of Lord Reay's
