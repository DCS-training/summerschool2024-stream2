the poor.
   Anno 1759, Alexander Michie, wright in Aberdeen,
disponed a tenement, consisting of two small dwelling houses
and a garden, in favour of the Poor's Hospital, which now
rent at between L. 11 and L. 10 Sterling annually.

societies in this town, besides the corporations; and their
annual disbursements to the poor, amounted to L. 1183
Sterling.

trustees named by himself, and a delegate to be chosen from
