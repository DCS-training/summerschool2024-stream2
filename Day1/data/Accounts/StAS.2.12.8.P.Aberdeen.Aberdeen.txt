indicate only the moisture that is diffused in the air; thus almost
necessarily assuming that the air in which they indicate the pre-
sence of moisture, already holds dissolved or combined with it, all the
water which at the observed temperature it is capable of taking.  It
is obvious that there is therefore a great and a variable quantity of
moisture contained in the air to which such instruments are exposed,
of which they give no indication.  Others are formed on the prin-
ciple of estimating the quantity of water which the air, under given
circumstances, is capable of dissolving, in addition to the unas-
certained quantity which it already has.  A third class depend
for their principle on the known facts, that cold air is capable of
dissolving less moisture than hot air, and that the moister the air
is at any given temperature, the smaller will be the reduction of
temperature, required to cause it to deposit a part of that moisture,
or, as it is said, to bring it to the dew point; and the hygrometer
consists of a vessel having a thermometer inclosed in it, which is to
be cooled until moisture begins to be deposited on its surface, when
the indications of the inclosed thermometer will show at what tem-
perature the air subjected to observation would become incapable
of retaining all its moisture.  And a fourth kind is founded on the
principle, that evaporation is accompanied by a diminution of tem-
perature in proportion to its rapidity; the instrument, therefore,
consists of two thermometers, one of which has its bulb covered
with moistened muslin, and its indications are obtained by noting
the difference between the two thermometers.  This last kind of hy-
grometer seems to give a more philosophically accurate result than
the others; but there are circumstances which none of them take
account of, and which it is perhaps impossible to devise an instru-
ment to show satisfactorily.  The sensible effects of the moisture
contained in the air often depend not so much on its absolute
quantity, (or on its quantity as considered in relation to the tem-
perature prevailing at the time,) as on some differences whose
causes are by no means well understood, by which the air is ren-
dered more or less disposed to part with the moisture which it
holds, or to dissolve an additional quantity; and these, though not
altogether unconnected with its temperature, are yet by no means
solely dependent on it.  The indications of the state of the atmo-
sphere in regard to moisture and dryness, which are furnished by
the flight of insects and birds, and by the feelings of persons of
infirm health, are often more delicate, and not unfrequeney more
accurate, than those given by any hygrometer.  That changes in
the state of the air in regard to elasticity have a principal share
