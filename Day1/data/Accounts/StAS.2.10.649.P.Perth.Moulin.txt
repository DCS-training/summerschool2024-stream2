       men no less by his thrilling eloquence than by his soul-harrowing
       disclosures of Pag`n barbarities.  His late powerful and impres-
       sive appeals to the General Assembly, and in all parts of Scot-
       land, in behalf of the natiie outcasts of that country, excited an
       interest towards them which, it is hoped, will never die away.
       With his heart in India, he is again preparing, with a constitution
       in some measure renovated, to join his able and efficient fellow-
       labourers there, in the work of infusing into the minds of the na-
       tive youth, principles which may eventually tend to subvert the
       whole fabric of Hinduism, and to erect, on its ruins, the pure, hu-
       manizing, and Heavenly system of Christianity.

         Parochial Registers.-The date of the earliest entry is 1707.
       They have been kept pretty regularly since, and contain ample
       evidence of the troublous times in which our fathers lived.  In
       1745-6, while the rebel army was in the country, it is stated that
       public worship was, in consequence, suspended for several Sab-
       baths.  The clergyman of Moulin, at the time, was known to en-
       tertain hostile feelings towards the Prince's cause; but the only
       loss he appears to have sustained was from a visit of Charles's
       followers who, sans ceremanis, dismantled his kitchen of some
       nicely dried summer provisions.
          Antiquities, &c.-The description given in the former Statisti-
       cal Account of the old ruin which stands in the neighbourhood of
       the village of Moulin, corresponds very much with the state of the
       building as it is at present; the only difference is, that the area
