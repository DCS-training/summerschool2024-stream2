			PARISH OF LOCHMABEN.*

		PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMADEN, SYNOID OF DUMFRIES.

		   THE REV. THOMAS MARJORIBANKS, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name, &c.--There can be little doubt that Lochmaben derives
its name from the number of lochs which surround it, although
there is a tradition, that, in olden times, a nunnery was built upon
a small island in one of the largest of these lakes; from which cir-
cumstance, persons conversant with the Gaelic language say,--Loch-
maben signifies "Loch of the Maidens" or "Loch of the Fair."
The Scoto-Irish settlers called it Loch-ma'-ban, the lake in the
white plain, because the Castle loch, near which Lochmaben is built,
exhibits a white appearance, when contrasted with the black sur-
face of the ridge which bounds it on the west. The town is most
delightfully situated at a short distance from the banks of the
Annan, verifying the old Scotch rhyme,-
		"Lochmaben stands most beautiful,
		  Near unto Antian side,
		In old times kings and princes there,
		  For safety did abide."
	In viewing this ancient seat of kings from some rising ground
on the west, it appears so completely surrounded with water, that
a stranger would suppose it impossible to be entered without the
aid of a boat.
	Boundaries.--The parish is bounded on the north Johnstone-
on the east by Applegarth and Dryfsdale; on the south by Dalton;
and on the west by Torthorwald and Tinwald. In length it ex-
tends 10 miles, and in breadth 3. Its contents are 10750 En-
glish acres, or 8546 Scotch, or 16 3/4 square miles. The landward
part of the parish is valued on the stent roll at 6000 merks, and
the burgh roods at 500, thus making the landward part L. 7337,
1s. 11d., and the burgh L. 1824, 7s. 1d., or the whole L. 9161, 9s.
	Topographical Appearances.--The surface is in general plain
