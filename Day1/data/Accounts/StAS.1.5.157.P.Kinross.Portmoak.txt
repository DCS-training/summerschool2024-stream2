and its average breadth one.  It is sandy warm soil, pro-
ducing, even in its present state, rich and early crops.  There
is no ground in this country, capable of making more quick
and ample returns for the labour bestowed upon it; and 
yet, with all these advantages, it is far from being well
cultivated.  That part of the arable ground, which lies
south of the Leven, is somewhat later, and in its present
state less fertile, but it is also very valuable and capable of 
much improvement.  The greater part of the moss is co-
vered with heath, and could not be cultivated without
much labour and expense.  It appears to have been once
covered with wood, as the roots of large oak trees are fre-
quently found in it, still fixed where they first grew.  Va-
leriana Sylvestris, an herb well known to the apothecary, is
found here in great abundance.  The meadow ground pro-
duces plenty of coarse hay, fit only for black cattle.  The
hill grounds of the south-west Lomond, and part of Ben-
artic, having no heath, are green to the top, and afford ex-
cellent pasture for sheep.  At the bottom of the south
Lomond or Bishop's hill, there is a number of copious
springs of excellent water.  One of these is so remarkable,
that the hospital of Lochleven, which stood near it, was call-
ed Fons Scotice, now Scotland Well.  The height of this
branch of the Lomonds has never been measured.

   Lake, Islands, River, etc.-Lochleven, which is half sur-
rounded by this parish, is a spacious and beautiful lake.
It is about 15 miles in circumference, and interspersed
with islands of various appearance and extent.  One of
these contains about 48 English acres of good pasture.  In
this, which is called St Serf's isle, was situated the ancient
priory of Lochleven.  About 2 miles N. W. of this, there
is a small island, almost covered with the ruins of a castle,
once belonging to the Douglasses of Lochleven, and former-
