cester sheep, are the common breeds.  The fences are well kept,
and the farm-houses and offices in good repair.
  Leases generally run from fifteeen to nineteen years.
  Rent of Land.-The average rent of arable land may be esti-
mated to be somewhere about 18s. or L.1 an acre. L.1, 15s.for
an ox or cow,and 6s.for a owe-are the average rates of grazing for
the year.
    Wages.-The common rate of country labour for men is 1s. 8d.
per day in summer; in winter 1s. 6d.  A good deal of farm-work
is done by women, who receive from 8d. to 10d. a day, according
to the season.  Hinds and ploughmen's wages are paid partly in
meal, and partly in money.  They have also, in general, a spot of
ground for growing vegetables; a cow kept for them by their em-
ployer, who plants for their use a certain space in the field with
potatoes, and drives a fixed quantity of coals.  Cottages are some-
times let to labourers, on the condition of their working in harvest,
and the hinds are bound to supply workers in the field when wanted,
who are called bondagers.  Men employed in cutting hay have better
wages, than when at other day labour.  They have been paid, of late
years, from 2s. to 2s.3d. per day. Harvest wages for men, besides
victuals and lodging, run from 12s. to 13s. per week, and wo-
men's from 11s. to 12s. The rate of payment of masons and car-
penters is from 2s.6d.to 3s. a day. Smiths occasionally do work
by contract, that is to say, keep a pair of horses in shoes, and a
plough in good repair, for a fixed sum per annum.
   Fuel.-From the distance of coal, fuel is an expensive article;
L. 1 per ton may be given as the price of coals, and 4s. 6d. per
cart of wood, which is a good deal used.
   The total rental of the parish may amount somewhere to about
L. 3220 per annum.
   Produce.-The following may be given as an estimate of the
average gross amount of raw produce.
