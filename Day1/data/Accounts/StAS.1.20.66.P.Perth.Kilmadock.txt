   7. Inclosing.-The fields being drained, levelled, cleared
of stones, and trenched where necessary, the marches
straightened, and interpersed fields exchanged, inclosing
then becomes an obvious advantage.
   There is scarcely more than one-tenth of the parish of
Kilmadock inclosed and subdivided, though excellent stones
for dikes could be got almost every where, and hedges
could be reared over three-fourths of the grounds.
   The grand objects of inclosing are, the safety of the crop
from cattle, and the ease of the cattle while feeding; either
of which advantages are alone sufficient to recommend a
fence.  It is a serious matter for a farmer to have, perhaps,
the breadth of one or two yards round his fields destroyed
by the cattle.  It is a proposition in geometry, that the
smaller the area the greater is the circumference in propor-
tion.  Hence, the smaller the field, the greater is the da-
mage from the cattle.
   The parish of Kilmadock, where waste and uninclosed, is
ploughed in detached fields, while the intermediate spaces
are used for pasture.  The consequence is obvious:  That
the circumference or border of each field is abused by the
cattle, or the grass lost; either of which is a very serious
disadvantages to the farmer.
   With regard to the ease and safety of the cattle, the dif-
ference of open from inclosed fields is beyond calculation.
A cow is an animal that is fond of ease, and never thrives
under the management of a hind.  A cow, again, loves to
crop the morning dew, and to rest at noon.  The hind, on
the contrary, cannot rise betimes, and is therefore under the
necessity of feeding the cattle in the heat of the day, when
they with to lie down and rest.  A cow is likewise fond of
lying down at evening, without the fatigue of travelling far
to her bed; the hind, on the country, drives her home to
the stall, where she is tied to a stake like a criminal.  In
