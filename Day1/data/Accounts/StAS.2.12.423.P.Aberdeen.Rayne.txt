   The soil of the best fields is loam oil a bottom of clay, more or,
less mixed with gravel, and which, with good culture, bears abun-
dant crops; the residue is a poorer soil, of less depth, and on a
harder bottom, in some parts of till, and in others of rotten rock,
here called chad.  But this ground also, when manured, produces
grain of fair quality, though in much smaller quantity than the
former; and the green crops and herbage raised on it are found
to be less succulent and nutritious than those which grow on the
rich infield grounds.
   The soil and climate cannot be called favourable to the larger
species of fruit, being neither a carse, nor a mountain-sheltered
strath; and few fruit trees are planted here, except in the gardens
of proprietors; but a taste for growing gooseberries, and currants
for preserving, is gradually advancing among the tenantry; and
these small fruits are produced of very good quality.  There are
no rare species of wild plants in this locality, nor any forests of
natural wood; but there are a few enclosures of moderate com-
pass planted with larch and Scots fir, which last grows rapidly
in the early stages, but begins to show symptoms of decay after
the fortieth year.  Ash and elm, beech and plane trees, which are
here planted in belts and rows, and around gardens, grow to a
goodl size, and yield timber of excellent quality.

   Eminent Men.-One, native may be mentioned on account
of the eminence which he attained abroad, viz. William Leslie,
second son to William, the fifth laird of Warthill, in this
place.  Born in 1657, he got a classical education in the pa-
rochial school, and, having completed his academical studies
at one of the universities in Aberdeen, became schoolmaster in
the parish of Chapel of Garioch for some years; but, being there
persuaded by Count Leslie, a member of the Balquhane family,
and his own cousin-german, to embrace the Romish faith, he went
to Rome with the Count in 1684; and there became so noted for
his learning and piety, that, at the age of thirty-three years he was
chosen to be Professor of Theology, in the Cllege of Padua, and
was afterwards madb Bishop of Laybacb in Carniola, and a Prince
of the German empire, which honour, along with others, he retain-
ed through life: he died at his see in 1727.  During his long
residence abroad, he faithfully corresponded with his brother Alex-
ander, the sixth laird of Warthill, and sent him at one time an ori-
ginal portrait of himself, esteemed a good picture, and which, with
