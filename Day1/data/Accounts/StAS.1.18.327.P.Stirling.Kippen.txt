the glens, through which the water collected in the moor
runs down into the Forth, the trees grow thick, and within
these 50 years, stocks of oaks with young shoots growing
from them have been seen in different places: these however,
are now rooted out, and the fields cleared for the plough.

   Stones.-The moor abounds with red and white free-stone.
On the southern boundary lime-stone is also found.  This
lime-stone, containing a considerable portion of sand, fuits
the carse well, but is not thought so proper for the dry-
field.

   Lake.-In the moor, there is a small lake or reservoir of
water called Loch-leggan, about a mile in circumference.
A small stream issues from it, which turns several mills.  In
the middle of the loch, there is a cairne, or heap of stones,
supposed to be the ruins of an old house, of which however,
no authentic accounts can now be obtained.  There are no
fish in the loch, but a few perches of a small size.  Trouts
are to be had in the several rivulets which run into the Forth:
the burn of Boquhan affords them in greatest plenty.

   River Forth.-The river Forth has but a mean appearance
in this part of the country.  It is confined within narrow and
deep banks, and except in a few places, its current is so very
slow, as hardly to be perceptible.  From Gartmore to Stir-
ling, a line of 20 miles, the fall of the river is laid not to
exceed, on an average, a foot in the mile.  The banks of the
Forth, are from 10 to 20 feet; and in some places more from
the surface of the bank, to the bottom of the river.  Many
large trees are still found in the bottom; and some appear
with their ends projecting from the banks, as the water wash-
es away the clay.  They are found at different depths, from
