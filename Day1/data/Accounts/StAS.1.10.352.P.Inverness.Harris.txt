the low and swampy grounds.  The only species of tillage
adapted to this soil, where thin and scanty, is that of the
lazy-bed; and, where it is swampy, a considerable expence
of previous draining and trenching is requisite to bring it into
arable land.  Something, no doubt, might be done in this
branch of agricultural improvement; but few attempts have
yet been made, partly through the predilection of the people
in favour of the ancient system of management, and partly
through want of encouragement from the proprietors.  Deep
black moss is the only soil to be found along the east coast,
and on the forest shores.  It is curious to observe how the
inhabitants of these creeks labour to cultivate it.  The first
operation in this tedious process is cutting of the sea-ware for
manure, each colony having a portion of shore allotted to it
for this purpose, by the proprietor or principal tacksman of
whom it holds.  This is done at low water, in spring tides,
by the tenants of each creek, in common, and led up in creeks
on men's backs above flood mark, in as many heaps as there
are tenants on the farm; for which heaps they afterwards
cast lots, and each carries his share on his back to his own
ground, which also has been previously assigned him by lot.
Not only the poorness of the pasture, but the ruggedness of
the ground disables him from keeping a horse, to lead the
manure to his ground; for he often has it to carry through
paths entirely impassible by the country gearrans, though they
are perhaps the best climbers of their kind in the world.
Having thus carried up his share of the sea-ware, he spreads
it very thick on the surface of a narrow rigg, disposed as the
nature of the ground (than which nothing can be imagined
more irregular) may chance to admit, either in a straight,
circular, serpentine, or zig-zag direction, round the interven-
ing rocks, pools, or bogs.  Then he begins to labour with
his casdireach, an implement of husbandry like that known
