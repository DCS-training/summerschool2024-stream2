   From this it is evident, that there has been a considerable re-
duction in the number of paupers; but in addition to this, and what
is of infinitely more importance than the amount of money saved,
it is believed that it is promoting in some measure the revival of
that wholesome spirit of independence which an assessment never
fails to destroy, and strengthening the power of the relative ties,
which it so fearfully impairs.  It is but fair, however, to add that
it is not in the full sense of the word voluntary, as there exists an
understanding among the proprietors and tenantry that they shall
contribute a certain sum weekly at the church door. This, however,
is not enforced, and of course the burden of the support falls upon
the more generous, and on those who are most regular in their at-
tendance at church.

                    MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   We have already stated our belief, that, since the time of the
Statistical Report of 1627, the population of the parish must have
diminished very considerably, though to what extent, or from what
precise cause, it is impossible to ascertain.  Since the period of
the last Statistical Account (1792,) in consequence of the improve-
ments in agriculture, it has materially increased, the number be-
ing then 1200, and now 1431.  It is somewhat singular, however,
that the average number of births and marriages, so far as can be
ascertained, of that and the present period, is very nearly the same;
while it is believed that, in the present, there is a considerable di-
minution in the deaths.
   The real rental of the parish was, in the year 1790, L. 6000,
and is now supposed to be about L. 10,227, or nearly the same as
the valued rental in Scots money.  No account is given in the re-
port of 1627 of the gross rental, but the rent per acre seems to
have varied from one to two bolls, for we have many such state-
ments as the following: "George Home has 6 aikers worth in
yearlie rent to him 6 bolles.  Patrick Lindsay has eleven aikers
worth 20 bolls."  The crops cultivated by the last report were,
