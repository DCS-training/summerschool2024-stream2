quits the possession of his farm.  There are few in the lower
part of the parish, who have not their arable and meadow
land separated by dykes from their pasture; and many have
their whole farms inclosed and divided.-The practice of
inclosing is gradually extending itself over the parish; and is
judged to be the most profitable species of improvement, that
the nature of the country in general will admit of.-The
dykes are commonly built with dry stone, and are usually about
five feet high, about two feet wide at the foundation, and
ten or twelve inches at the top.-But this practice of inclo-
sing, together with the increase of rents, has occasioned the
dismission of herds and cottagers; and, of consequence, has ma-
terially affected the population of the district.  Many persons
of that description lived in the parish; and their services were
particularly necessary while the ground was open.  They had
from their masters a house and yard, a small piece of land,
grass for one or more cows, &c. the value of which was ac-
counted trisling, while the rents were low:  But when they
came to be doubled or trebled, the farmer began to calculate
the cost, and to estimate what the grass of every cow was
worth, &c. and thus they were spurred on to inclose their
grounds, that they might not have occasion for such a burden in
future.  But however profitable this expedient might be to
the farmer himself, it has evidently proved inimical to the po-
pulation, and perhaps to the real improvement, of the coun-
try.  About twenty years ago there was hardly a tenant who
had not one or more of these cottagers on his farm, whereas now
there are very few of them in the whole parish.-The
cottages were the nurseries of servants; but their inhabi-
tants have now been removed to towns, and having bred up
their children to other employments, farm servants have become
exceedingly scarce throughout the whole country.
