5. receive supply regularly, from 3 s. to 5 s. each-a month;
and, besides this,-5 s. 10 s or 15 s. at each of two half year-

or as occasion requires.
   The funds are, the collections at the church on Sundays,
and other days of public worship, the interest of 115 L. in
bank, and the interest of 40 L. part of a late donation, on
bond to the session.  These funds have been hitherto suffi-
cient to support all the poor of the parish in a very compe-
tent manner, and none of them are allowed to beg.
   There is no way of supporting the poor so easy, and
so little expensive, as from the collections at church.  As-
sessments are attended with more trouble, and are consider-
ably more expensive; for many claim to be admitted on the
poor's roll when the poor are supported in this way, who, in
the same circumstances, would make greater exertions to
support themselves before they applied for supply out of the
funds provided in the other way.  Assessments, however,
are certainly the most equitable method of supporting the
poor.  When heritors, either from non-residence or unfre-
quent attendance upon public worship, contribute nothing,
or do not contribute their just proportion; and when, from
a spirit of sectarianism, many others withdraw from the esta-
blished Church, and also contribute nothing, it is often im-
possible, and always unfair and unreasonable, that those only
who do attend the church should bear the whole burden of
the poor.
