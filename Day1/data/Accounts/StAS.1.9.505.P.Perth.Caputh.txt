of 160 Scotch acres, regularly steep on every side, and in 
every part of equal height, that is, about 60 feet above the
great plain of the Stormont, on which it stands.  Here the
Picts had a town, which must have been a place of great
strength, and of which the vestiges may be discerned at the
south-west corner of this singular elevation.  Boetius calls it
Tuline or Tulina, and says, that it was populous and well 
fortified; but deserted and burnt by the Picts on the ap-
proach of the Romans under Agricola: he adds, (as trans-
lated by Holinshed,) " the Scottishmen in our time call the
place Inchtuthill*."  The Romans also availed themselves
of this situation.  Their camp stood on the north-east bor-
der, and commanded an extensive view of the plain.  It is
500 yards square; the walls, to a considerable height, were
strongly built, nine feet and a half thick, with stones
brought from a quarry 2 miles distant; the stones have 
been gradually removed, and the walls are now almost le-
velled by the plough.  In the course of ploughing, frag-
ments of weapons, and some entire utensils, were formerly
found.  Here, Mr Pennant fixes the AErrea of the Romans;
with much greater probability than Dr Stukeley +, who 
supposes it to have been Perth; though in; is map, he
places it north-east of the Tay, and on the very spot where
the present Delvin stands.  There are two tumuli or bar-
rows, and a redoubt, on the south-east side of the camp.
A few years ago, the largest of these barrows was opened,
and consisted of a rich black mold, possibly composed of
