which, of late, have been falling off.  It has been doubted
whether our law authorising pigeon-houses is not, in some
degree, contrary to natural equity; as it does not seem rea-
sonable that any one should keep a house furnished with a
multitude of animals, over which he has no government, and
which prey on his neighbour's corn as freely as on his
own, while he alone has the profit.  It has also been doubted,
whether, on the whole, pigeons are not detrimental to the
public, by devouring more corn than the profit of them is
worth; it having been stated as a fact, that a pigeon-house of
an ordinary size, moderately stocked, will consume 200 quar-
ters of feed in a year.

   As an instance of remarkable industry, it may be mention-
ed, that a young man of this parish went into the north of
England as a labourer, and laid by, out of his earnings, in the
course of somewhat more than 20 years, L. 400 Sterling.  He
then returned to his native parish, purchased and furnished a
pretty extensive feu, upon which he has lived with his family
28 years.
