had insused into his farm, both that he may be compensa-
ted for his past trouble, and that he may prevent another's
being tempted to offer for it.  Either he, or another, enters
agin for 19 years; if the old, or entering tenant, have not
a considerable stock, (which is generally the cafe), the one
half of his time, at least, is over, before he can have even his
infield in any tolerable order; consequently, as he has
made nothing of it, he is unable to do any thing to his
outfield.  The end of his lease is at hand, and, as he is not
sure to get it renewed, if he has a young family, they
must be set off to some business, that they may provide for
themselves another way; and, if possible, for their parents,
who are in great danger of being turned out of their usual
way of making bread, when they are scarcely able to ap-
ply themselves to any thing else.  His lease being nearly
expired, this tacksman, like his predecessors, begins direct-
ly to take out of his farm what little substance he had put
in.  Thus the land is regularly impoverished every 9
years.  But if they had long leases, even on the condition
of an increasing rent, and that at different periods, which
would answer the proprietor's purpose equally well, they
could improve with their whole substance, and, as soon as
their children came up, they would all exert themselves
upon the farm, as being a sure source of provisions for their
family for many years.  Thus would the appearance of
the country be rendered unspeakably better, the young
men would be induced to stay in the place of their nativi-
ty, the people would become more opulent, and be bet-
ter accommodated, and at the same time the proprietor's
rents would be gradually raised, and more punctually paid.
