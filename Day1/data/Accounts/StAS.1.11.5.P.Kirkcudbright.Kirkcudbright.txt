ter, conveyed in leaden pipes, from a quarter of a mile's
distance.  This very useful work, which cost upwards of
500 L. Sterling, was executed in 1764.  One half of the ex-
pence was defrayed by the burgh, and the other half by pri-
vate subscribers: A great undertaking at the time, consider-
ing the revenues of the town were but small, and the opulence
of me individuals not great.

Farms,Produce,Improvement, etc.-The whole
  landed property is divided into 40 farms, which,   Scoth acres.
  upon an accurate measurement, contain                    12,325
From a laboured calculation, made from 8 dif-
  ferent farms, promiscuously taken, the contents
  of which were exactly ascertained, the propor-
  tion of arable to pasture land was as 4 to 1.
  Hence the unarable is                                     3,081

These, deducted from the total number of acres,
  leave of arable                                           9,244
Of this quantity, one fourth is annually in tillage,        2,311
Of arable, there is annually in pasturage,                  6,933
To this add the unarable parts,                             3,081

Remain in hay and pasturage yearly,                        10,014
About one fourth of the ground in grain is an-
nually sown out,                                              578

As every acre in tillage yields, upon an ave-
rage, at least 33 Winchester bushels, there is           Bushels.
produced annually,                                         76,263
Of this quantity, the farmer reserves, at an ave-
rage, two thirds to support his family, feed his
horses, and sow his ground.-Remain for
