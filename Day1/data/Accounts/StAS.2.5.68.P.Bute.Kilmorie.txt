of L. 50, bequeathed by the late Major Macalister of Sprinkbank,
is the only provision for the support of the poor. Application for
parochial aid is decidedly considered degrading, and none but such
as are paupers in the strictest sense of the term apply for it. So
long as the funds for the support of the poor are furnished by the
congregation, the provision is regarded as a public charity, and
relief from this source is therefore the last resort of the indigent,
but were it levied by assessment, it would no longer be viewed in
this light. The love of idleness would speedily overcome the
pride of independence, and there would then be as much avidity
manifested to seize upon it, as there is now aversion to accept of it.

	Fairs.--There are three fairs held in the parish, all for the sale
of horses, viz. one at Lag, and two at Shedog.

	Inns and Ale-houses.--There are three inns, viz. Lag, Shedog.
and Lochranza; and three ale-houses. Here, as elsewhere, their
influence is pernicious, which is still the more grievous as their ex-
istence is unnecessary. More individuals addicted to spirits are
to be found in their vicinity, than anywhere else in the parish,
though we cannot say that in the whole of it there is one drunk-
ard.
	Fuel.--The fuel universally used is peat, which is found in great
abundance on the hills throughout all parts of the island. A few
of the larger farmers who are close upon the shore, and at a dis-
tance from the peat-moss, supply themselves partly with coals from
the opposit coast of Ayrshire.
