		I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name and Boundaries.-THE ancient name of this parish was
Abermilk; the British designation Aber, signifying the confluence
of waters, agrees with the situation of the parish, which is a kind
of peninsula formed by the junction of the rivers Milk and An-
nan. The inquisitio of Earl David found, in the year 1116, that
the lands of Abermilk belonged of old to the episcopate of Glas-
gow. The Bruces having built a castle on the Water of Milk in
the twelfth century, the name of the parish was changed to that
of Castlemilk. The parish under this new name is mentioned hn
the year 1170 by Pope Alexander; and in 1290, William de Gos-
ford, the parson of Castlemilk, swore fealty at Berwick to King Ed-
ward I. The church of the parish was dedicated to God under
the invocation of St Mungo, the canonized founder of the see of

favourite patron to the parish, as being more in unison with their
religious feelings than a designation which brought to their remem-

the alteration of the religion of Scotland, the name of St Mungo
has always designated the parish, except, perhaps, during that pe-
riod of intolerance when the appellations Saint and Devil were es-
teemed synonymous terms.
	The parish, situated in the upper ward of the ancient stewartry
of Annandale, extends from north to south about 4 mile, and
from east to west about 2 1/2 miles, containing 7 1/4 square miles; is
bounded on the south by the parish of Dalton; on the east by
Hoddam; on the north by Tundergarth; and by Dryfesdale on
the west.
	Topographical Appearances.-The surface of this parish is uneven,
being elevated into two hill ridges, and depressed by their accompany-
ing vales. On the south of the parish, the high wooded grounds of
