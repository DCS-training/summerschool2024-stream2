tle effect on the second crop, so that in most places the oats
turn to a poor account; they are also frequently insested with
a kind of small vetch that over-runs the ground and destroys
the crop.  Some years the pease answer extremely well, but
at other times they entirely fail.  The same may be said of the
beans, of which a few ere sown instead of oats or pease in
deep or very wet grounds.  The great dependence of the farm-
ers, therefore, is upon the bear, of which the parish yields
near 3000 bolls yearly.  When well dressed, each boll is sel-
dom below 18 stone weight, and often a stone or two more.
The soil in some places is said to be well adapted for lint, but
hitherto the attempts to rear that useful plant have been few
and feeble, and therefore not followed by any beneficial effects.
There is very little pasture ground in the low parts of the pa-
rish, and therefore few cows are maintained in it in summer.
A great quantity of potatoes are raised, hardly an inhabitant
of the parish but has a plantation of that useful root, which is
generally planted after a crop of bear, and prepares the ground
for another crop of grain.  The deer of the forest of Steitil
are very troublesome to the people of the glen in summer and
harvest, by eating their corn.

   Rent, Stipend, etc.-The Countess of Sutherland has the
whole property of the parish, but there are 6 wad-setters, of
whom 2 reside.  Several gentlemen of property have taken farms
in the parish; these farms are provided with good houses and
offices, and some are inclosed with stone dykes.  Some tacks-
men have the whole, and others a part, of their victual-rent
converted at 10 s. per boll.  The valued rent is L. 2264: 4: 8
Scotch.  The real rent is in victual 583 bolls, 1 firlot, 3 pecks,
and 2 lippies, in money L. 288: 12: 1 1/2 ster. and the fishing on
the river of Helmsdale the third part of L. 400, or L. 133: 6: 8
ster. all which, converting the victual at 10 s. per boll, amount
