been granted for 19 years, and the life of the tenant, and 
some for longer and more indefinite terms.  On the principal
estate in the parish called Dunnichen all servitudes were abo-
lished, viz. thirlage to the mill and blacksmith's shops, car-
riages, and bonnage, a word of Gothic extraction, which
means shearing corn.  Mony-rent was substituted in the 
place of oat-meal, barley, kane-fowls', yarn, and mill swine.
The farms were inclosed with fences of free-stone.  Better
houses and offices were built.  The breed of cattle and hor-
ses was improved.  Turnip, potatoes, kale, and clover and
rye grass, were planted and sown for winter provision.  The 
distinction of out and infield was laid aside, all the fields
were cropt and cultivated in due rotation.  But these im-
provements were much facilitated by means of a valuable ma-
nure which began to be used about that time in this and the
neighbouring parishes, viz shell marl, to which the late
considerable increase of the value of the lands may in a great
measure be ascribed.  This valuable manure being found in 
greater plenty in this neighbourhood than any where else in 
the kingdom, or even perhaps in the known world, it may
not be thought impertinent to describe it more particularly.
About two miles north from Dunnichen, there are a chain 
of lochs which abound with marl, viz. the lochs of Fortar,
Renmeth, Recobie, and Balgavies.  In these lochs, it lay
long an inaccessible treasure, till, about forty-five years; ago,
Captain Strachan, proprietor of the loch of Balgavies, began
to drag it, much in the same manner that batlast is dragged
from the bed of the river Thames.  This he performed with 
so much success, as not only amply to supply his own farms,
but to have a surplus for his neighbours.  His example was
