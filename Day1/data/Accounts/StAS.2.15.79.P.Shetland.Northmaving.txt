shore, and fish were found in abundance. Now, the fish have left
the shore, and the boats must sail or pull out to sea forty gr fifty
miles, to reach the fishing-ground ; and, if the weather is fine, they
remain two or perhaps three nights. During all this time, the
fare of the crews is very simple : water or bland, a little spirits, and
oaten cake. Seldom a season passes but some meet a watery
grave, and leave widows and orphans behind.

     	            V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
  EcclesiasticaL State.-The situation of the parish church is very
inconvenient for the greater part of the population. It is distant
from one extremity of the parish twelve miles, from another eight
miles, from another four miles; and it stands within 60 fathoms
of the edge of the sea. It was built in the year 1733, and was
repaired in the year 1764; and in the year 1825 the interior was
completely renewed. It has accommodation for about 600 per-
sons, and 70 sitting are set apart for the poor.
  The present manse was built about the year 1768, and repaired
in 1790. In the year 1821, it also received very extensive repairs
internally, so that it is amongst the most comfortable manses in,
the country. The glebe contains many acres of land, but how
many I know not, as it has never been all measured. It is not
valuable, however, according to its extent, as it is situated in four
different parts of the parish, all at a considerable distance from
each other. The present value is about L. 1.5. The stipend is
L. 150.
  There are a Methodist chapel and an Independent chapel,
which are together attended by abotit 100 members. The Esta-
blished Church is generally well attended, and the average-
number of communicants is 800; the number of families about
350.
Since my induction in 1830, no collections have been made for
religious or charitable purposes except once. The people in ge-
