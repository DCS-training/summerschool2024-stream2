creasing, he erected a draw-kiln last summer, and now pro-
poses to carry on the work with spirit.

   In the north-east district of the parish, adjacent to Black-
side-hill, there is an extensive moor, part of the estate of
Sorn, in which there is a seam of excellent coal, about 5
feet thick, within 4 or 5 feet of the surface, and of an un-
known extent.  This seam, it appears, had been partly
wrought in former times, but had been so much neglected
during the present century that its very existence was for-
gotten, till it was in a manner rediscovered last summer.
In the same moor and its vicinity there are great quantities
of iron-stone; specimens of marble and of black-lead have
likewise been found there, and some lime-stone of an admi-
rable quality.  Were a communication opened with this
moor, by means of a road of 2 or 3 miles in length, it
would probably, beside improving the farms through which
it must pass; become a source of great wealth to the pro-
prietor, as well as of great accommodation to the surround-
ing country.  In this instance, and in many others which
have not yet been sufficiently explored, the bleak moors of
Caledonia, and her hills covered with blue mists, will,
doubtless, be found to contain some of her most valuable
treasures.
   Farther to the southward, but still on the north side of
the river, and about a mile distant from it, there are 2 lime
quarries, on the march between the Sorn and Dalgain
estates, one upon each of these estates.  The quarry on the
Dalgain side has been wrought for many years, and both
works are now carrying on together.  Last summer 12 men
were employed in quarrying and burning the lime-stone,
and the contractor had engaged to furnish 12,000 bolls of
shell; owing, however, to the wetness of the season, and
the impossibility of procuring a sufficient number of hands,
this quantity was not fully completed.  At the same place,
