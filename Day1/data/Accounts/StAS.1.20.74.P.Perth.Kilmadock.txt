   Thrashing-mill.-This is one of the most ingenious and
most useful inventions that has, perhaps, ever appeared in
the world.
   The first inventor was Michael Stirling, farmer in Craig-
head, in the parish of Dunblane, who died in the 89th year
of his age, on the 1st of February 1796.  This venerable old
man, when in the prime of life, had a strong propensity to
every curious invention; and, after much thought and study,
he prepared and finished a machine for thrashing his corn in
the year 1748, having employed tradesmen to execute the
work under his direction.
   The axis of the thrashing-board, was placed perpendicu-
lar, and was moved by an inner wheel, on the same axis
with an outer one that went by water.  The men stood
round about these boards like lint cleaners, each man with
his sheaf, and performed the work with great rapidity.
   Mr Stirling's ignorant neighbours werre, however, no way
struck with the invention,but laughed at it, and called him
a maggotty fellow.  In short, like Noah with hsi ark, poor
Mr Stirling was surrounded only with mockers, and at
length he concealed his operations altogether.  The won-
derful powers of the machine, however, soon drew the at-
tention of strangers, who came and picked up models, and
so were enabled to erect others, both in Scotland and Eng-
land.  Mr Stirling's machine, in one short winter-day, thrash-
ed 50 threaves of stiff outfield corn, yielding 16 bolls of
oats, which would have taken 16 days of one man to
thrash with the flail.  This account was got from William
Stirling, farmer in Craigforth, one of Michael Stirling's
sons, who is a very respectable man, on whose report the
public may rely.
   Mr Stirling's mill being perpendicular, was found rather
inconvenient, and therefore Mr Meikle at Allon, an inge-
nious gentleman, constructed a horizontal axis for the thrash-
