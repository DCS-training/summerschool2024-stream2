mentioned, are not very considerable.  Their state may,
in general, be known from the following list of tradesmen
and artificers:-Blacksmiths, 4; coopers, 4; dyers, 4;
flax-dressers, 3; gardeners, 2; hosiers, 11; masons, 7;
shoemakars, 12; tailors, 5; weavers, 28; wrights, 14.-
Masons and wrights receive 1 s. 8 d. a-day, during sum-

In this they think themselves to be warmer and more com-

apparel is chiefly a variety of stuffs of their own manufac-

weft; drugget, composed of linen warp and woollen weft;
barns, and other coarse linens of various kinds, besides
plaiding, both tweeled and plain, for gowns and petticoats.
Their bed-cloaths, as blankets, ticking, etc. are wholly of

of their own raising, and the woollen from fleeces the pro-
