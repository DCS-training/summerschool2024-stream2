     of Ecclesgreig, or St. Cyrus

happens between the terms of Candlemas and Michaelmas,
which are fixed for the commencement and ending of our
salmon fishing.  Seldom are the same number of hands so
profitably employed!  Perhaps it might be more for the be-
nefit of the fishing, both to begin and leave it off a month
sooner.  Continuing to fish to the end of September, comes
too near the spawning season; and if so, must strike at the
source of the increase of the fish; but to begin sooner than
February, when the weather would permit, could do no in-
jury.  Fourteen boats are employed in the salmon fishing
during the summer months, but seldom half that num-
ber are needed in the spring and autumn.  The skippers,
or men who have the charge of the boats, and give di-
rections when to draw the net, have for their wages, dur-
ing the fishing season, 6 L., with 4 bolls of oatmeal, and 7 s. for
sap-money, or drink to their meals.  When they have only
5 L., with the same allowance for victuals, they receive the
douceur of one halfpenny for each salmon they take.  This
gives them an interest in the success of the fishing, which
makes them exert themselves, and must be an advantage to
their employers.  They are also with propriety called sight-
men; because, from habit and attention, they become wonder-
fully quick-sighted in discerning the motion and approach of
one or more salmon, under the water, even when ruffled by
the wind, and deepened by the flowing tide.  The ropemen,
their assistants, who draw the net, have 3 s. 9 d. per week,
with two pecks of meal for wages and maintenance.  Of late,
very few of the salmon caught in this river have been sold
for exportation.  Indeed there has been no occasion; for the
fish being preserved fresh in ice, or boiled in a proper prepara-
tion of vinegar and salt, and sent by sea to London, meet with
a ready market.
