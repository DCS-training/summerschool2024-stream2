Most of them can speak nothing else, and the few that can
speak the English do it but very imperfectly.  The High-
land dress is still retained by them in a great measure.  The 
plaid is almost totally laid aside; but the small blue bonnet.
the short coat, the tartan kilt and hose, and the Highland
brogues are still the ordinary dress of the men.  The women
in like manner retain the Highland dress of their sex, but
have adopted more of that of their low country neigbours
than the men.

   Occupation and Division of the Inhabitants.-There are no
towns, no villages, no manufactures in this parish.  All the
inhabitants are farmers, cottagers employed by them, or arti-
ficers employed by both.  "Besides the ordinary farmers, or
tenants and cottagers having huts from them, there is a great
number of crosters, who have been planted by the proprie-
tors in waste ground to improve it.  The number of farmers
is not less than ninety; three or four of them have pretty
large farms, paying L. 100, L. 8., and L. 60 Sterling yearly;
but the more general run is not above L. 20 or L. 25 of
yearly rent, and there are a good many of them even below
L. 10.  The cottagers are partly servants and labourers em-
ployed by the tennants, and partly follow other occupations,
as taylors, weavers, shoemakers, etc.  There are four mills
in the parish for grind g the grain.  There are also some
fishers in the parish, as many as man two or three boats.
