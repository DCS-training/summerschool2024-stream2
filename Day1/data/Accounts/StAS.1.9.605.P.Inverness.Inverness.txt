who resides at the distance of two miles from the town,
and who suffered in his family by the natural small-pox, is
become, with the lower class of people, an inoculator.  The
first he inoculated was a child of his own, and an only child.
He forcibly inculcates a sedulous attention to light bed-
clothes, fresh air, cleanliness, and simple diet.  He is a suc-
cessful inoculator, and has the generosity to practice gratis.
We have not heard of any remarkable instance of longe-
vity in this parish.  Persons of 80, and some years beyond
that period, are not uncommon; a few we have known who
survived 92 and 93 years, but not one who lived up to a
full 100.

   Lake and River.-Lochness is partly in this parish.  It is
24 miles long, and at a medium 2 broad.  Soon after the
Revolution, it was sounded by one George Scot, with 500
fathoms, and afterward by a Captain Orton, with a whole
barrel of plumb-line, but without success; no bottom could
be found*.  Six John Pringle, however, who in the year
1746 was with the army at Fort Augustus, says+, that the
common soundings are from 116 to 120 fathoms, and that
in one place they ran to 135.  On the supposition that the
soundings of either period were general over the whole
lake, and not particular, confined to different parts of it, we
cannot help considering the soundings of the latter period to
be the more probable account.  But when the great extent
of the lake is attended to, it seems not unlikely that the
former and latter soundings were in different parts of the
lake.  It is very probable that the latter soundings were in
the south end of it, near which the army then lay in en-
campment.  The soundings by George Scot and Captain
