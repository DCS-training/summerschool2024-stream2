two at the Crook of Dovan, and two at Blairingone.  They
may perhaps be all necessary, as, independant of the markets,
both villages are on the high roads and Blairingone adjoining
the Duke of Atholl's coal-work; but it is universally found,
that too many houses, where ardent spirits are sold, do hurt
both to the morals and circumstances of the people.
   2. Inclosures.  Since the year 1782, above 2000 acres of
land have been inclosed.  The sences are partly made with
stone, partly with ditch and hedge.  The inclosures are of
various dimensions, such as best suited the situation, design,
and extent of the farms; they are of all sizes, from 5 to 40
acres.  Where they are intended only for pasture, they ex-
tend to nearly an 100 acres.  A stone dyke is the most im-
mediate, and most secure sence.  A hedge in this climate, is
slow in growing, but when reared, serves both to beautify
and shelter the grounds; and this country, lying high, being
much exposed, and having hitherto little advantage from
trees, stands much in need of shelter.  Proprietors, how-
ever, are providing on their lands, a remedy for these incon-
veniences, by planting.
   3. Planting.  Planting till of late was not much attended
to; there is indeed some natural wood, and some small plan-
tations, in various parts of the parishes, which have been ad-
vancing for a considerable time.  They are sufficient to shew,
that trees will flourish in the soil.  This is indeed demonstrat-
ed by the trees, which according to an old custom, observed
in most parts of Scotland, have been planted around the
barn-yards.  These, which consist chiefly of ash, plane, and
Scotch fir, have grown, even in the highest grounds, to a
very considerable size, considering the time when they were
planted.  Planting is, however, now become fashionable,
and is proceeding with rapidity.  Within the last 8 years,
about 800,000 trees have been planted.  Some of them on
