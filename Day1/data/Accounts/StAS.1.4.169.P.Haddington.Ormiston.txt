to be depended upon, for bringing out an exact state of the
population of our country.  A few persons have emigra-
ted in quest of better encouragement.  There are 193 in-
habited houses, and the number of persons at an average to
each house is 4 1/2.

   Prices and Wages.-The price of beef, mutton, pork and
lamb 50 or 60 years ago, was from 1 1/2 d. to 2 1/2 d. the Dutch
pound.  Few calves are, or ever were fed in this parish.
Other articles were propotionably low.  The present ave-
rage price of beef, mutton, pork and lamb, throughout the
year, is about 3 1/2 d.  Wheat and other grain has advanced high
this year; but the average price is, wheat L. 1, 1 s. the boll,
barley 17 s. oats 14 s. and pease 12 s.  In husbandry, the
wages of labourers, by the day , are from 9 d. to 1 s.; of
wrights, 1 s. 4 d.; of brick-layers and masons, from 1 s. 8 d.
to 1 S. 10 d.; tailors, smiths and weavers have not advan-
ced their wages so high as others mentioned above.  Com-
mon labourers, when married, receive the same wages with
those mentioned above.  If the man  is fortunate in having
a frugal and industrious wife, he is able to maintain and e-
ducate his family very well.

   Village of Ormistoun.-The village of Ormistoun is the
only one in this parish which deserves the name.  It con-

ry natural and moral advantage for domestic comfort.  In
respect of health, the situation is very favourable.  The
village stands upon gravel, and consists chiefly of two rows
of houses of two stories, the one fronting the south, and the
other the north, with a broad airy street between them.
In the middle of the street is a cross, of which there is no
tradition; but from its ancient appearance, it is evidently a
relick of Popery.  The houses on both sides of the street
