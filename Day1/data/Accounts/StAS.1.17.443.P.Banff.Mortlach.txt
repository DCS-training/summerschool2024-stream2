ward to give him battle.  The armies get their first sight of
one another not far from the church of Mortlach; and a
very little to the northward of it they engage.  In the be-
ginning of the attack, while pushing on with too ardent an
impetuosity, Kenneth, Thane of the Isles; Dunbar, Thane
of Laudian; and Graeme, Thane of Strathern, are unfortu-

out a certain degree of enthusiasm, there is nothing great to
be done.  The charge, without delay, is generally and vigo-
rously renewed; and, under the mingled influence of patri-
otism and religions the Scotch carry every thing before them,
