nature of the soil and season; and, in a very particular
manner, according to the pains, manure, and culture be-
stowed*.
   There is scarcely any land in the parish below 20 s.
the acre.  The greater part gives 25 s. and 30 s.; a good
deal rents from 30 s. to 40 s., and some of it is as high as
50s.  Two remaining years of a farm, belong-
ing to Lord Gray, were lately bought up at 3l. 10s. and
upwards, the acre.  The present medium rent of land
maybe about 1 L. 8 s. or 10 s. the acre.
   A great deal more grain is raised in the parish than
serves itself.  Wheat and barley are exported to a con-
siderable amount; and the farmers can now sometimes
spare a few oats and pease, with a good deal of hay for
the market.  These are, indeed, the staple commodities
upon which they must depend for their rents, and the
support of their families.
   The grain in this part of the country, is generally of
an excellent quality, and the prices are proportionably
high.  Wheat, for the 2 last crops, sold from 21 s. to
24 s.; barley at 18 s.; oats at 15 s. and 16 s.; pease at
12 s. and 13 s. the boll, Linlithgow measure; oat meal
sold from 16 s. to 18 s. the boll, of 8 stones Dutch weight.
The kinds of ploughs used here, are commonly of Small's
construction, drawn by 2 horses: their number is about
56 or 58.  There are between 60 and 70 carts, exclusive
of corn-carts used in harvest.
