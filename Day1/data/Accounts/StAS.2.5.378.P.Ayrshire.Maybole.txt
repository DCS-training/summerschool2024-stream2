	The number of depositors (273) at 1st January 1837, may be
classed as follows, viz. farm-servants, (male 26, female 44,) 70;
domestic servants, 25; sewers, &C. 46; childred, &c. 47; labour-
ers, 28; weavers, 25; mechanics, &c. 17; not classed, 15. De-
positors, 273; of whom there are males, 126; of females, 147; to-
tal, 273--having due to them at 1st January 1837, per state of
account from bank, L. 1152, 14s.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The average number of persons
receiving parochial aid is about 70; and the average sum al-
lotted to each per week about 1s. 4d.
	The annual amount of contributions is about L. 230; L. 100
of which is raised by the ordinary collection at the church door,
and another L. 100 by a voluntary contribution from the heritors,
who are generally non-resident, and who in the payment of this
sum probably give less than they would do, in the course of a re-
gular attendance at church. The remaining L.30 is made up of
proclamation fees, collections at marriages, and private baptisms.
	If the general non-residence of the heritors, and the extent and
condition of the population be considered, there can be no doubt
that the poor in this parish are supported at as small an expense
as in any other parish similarly situated. But it must not be con-
cealed, that though among the native population there are a great
many who would starve rather than ask charity, this does not re-
sult from any general reluctance on the part of the poorer classes,
especially among the Irish, to ask for parochial relief, but because
they find in begging a more productive and agreeable mode of
support, than in the pittance given by the kirk-session. I am
quite sure that the fund publicly distributed bears a small propor-
tion to what is given every year by the inhabitants of the town and
country at their doors. Many fine things have been written in fa-
vour of this mode of management, and it no doubt has its advan-
tages; but the extensive training to habits of public begging which
it involves, cannot be estimated as a trifling drawback, when all
