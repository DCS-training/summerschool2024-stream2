   Tay and Salmon Fishings.-Besides a few rivulets
within the parish, the Tay washes its southern boundary
for 3 or 4 miles; and is here navigable for ships, cutter
built, of 100 tons:  Dutch or flat-bottomed vessels of
above 200 tons can go up to Perth.  Having received,
in its course, the Dochart, Lochy, Lion, Tumble, Gary,
Bran, Isla and Almond, all considerable rivers, besides
many inferior streams, the Tay carries here a body of
fresh water, far superior to any other river in the
island*.  The neap tides rise 6 feet; the spring ones
from 9 to 10 1/2.  But could the channel be contracted
by an embankment, especially upon the large plain,
which is overflowed for about 10 miles, between Inchyra
and Invergowrie, the tide would rise much higher, and
slow with greater rapidity; whilst large tacks of va-
luable land would be recovered for the purposes of agri-
culture.  This undertaking, however, is of such mag-
nitude and enormous expense, that it can only be the
work of ages.
   The Tay abounds with excellent salmon, and fine trot
of different kinds, particularly 2 species of sea-trout,
the white and red; the latter of which is reckoned the
stronger flavoured, the former more delicate.  They
weigh from 2 to 6 lb.  The large bull troat is some-
times found from 16 to 30 lb. and upwards.  The sal-
mon fishings in the Tay are an object of considerable
importance, and furnish a valuable article of trade to the
town of Perth.  The rent of the whole river, including
the late rises on the fishings, is, upon the most authentic
and respectable information, not below 7000 L. Sterling.
This is a great sum, when it is considered how rapidly 
at has arisen almost from nothing+.
