   Miscellaneous Observations.-No inhabitant of the parish
has been imprisoned for crimes during the incumbency of
the present minister, which has continued more than 16
years.  The people, as to individuals, rather than numbers,
are greatly changed in that period, on account of old tenants
going out, and new ones coming in.  They are sober
and industrious.  There is not so much as an ale-house now
in the whole parish.  The licences are so high, that no pu-
blic-house in a country place can afford to pay them; and
the duty upon malt is also so high, and so rigorously exacted,
that the people grudge to pay it.  This has retrenched the
comforts of life to several families; for a little ale was very
necessary for a while in winter, when the cows, mostly in
calf, and sed upon straw, yield but little or no milk.  One
improvement, however, has been fallen upon lately in the
means of living by handicraftsmen, and such as rent no land.
When the corns are got in, they buy a pig, which they
ring, and get liberty from their landlords for it to run about.
This they seed upon offals and potatoes, which they get
planted somewhere for work in harvest, and the animal be-
comes a good morsel at the end of March, and affords a
monthful now and then through the summer.  The article
of fuel is very scarce and expensive, especially for several
miles in the lower part of the parish, where there are no
peats.  And coals are brought 24 miles from Sanquhar; or
from some harbour, perhaps 2 miles below Dumfries, at a
dear rate, owing to the high duty that is upon that article,
when water-born.-A custom prevails all over the country,
of carrying the dead for interment to a distant church-yard,
if the ancestors of the deceased were buried there.  In fact,
there are more funerals here from other parishes than from
the parish itself, and the people here follow the same custom,
if they have burying-places elsewhere.-A farm on the east
