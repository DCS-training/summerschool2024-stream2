there is a fire-proof room for holding the records of the
county. *
   There is now in progress a new Inn, intended to supply the place
of the Castle Inn,-which, when finished, will be found to be one of
the best and most commodious upon the road between London and
Edinburgh.
                 <TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>
               In 1755 the population was    -	895
                  1785,	     -         -       1210
                  1811,	     -         -       1270
                  1821,      -         -       1349
                  1831,	     -         -       1442

   It may be proper to add, that in 1821, the population of the
town of Greenlaw was 765, that of the country parish 584: in 1831,
the town population was 895, that of the country parish 547.+

       of families chiefly employed in agriculture,	 -   -      84
       chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, or handicraft,	87
       of other families,   -    -    -    -    -    -           131

   The average number of illegitimate births yearly, during the last
three years, has been four.
   It appears from the foregoing statements that the population
has been and still is upon the increase. This may be accounted
for in part by the improvements which have been made in the
town, by the encouragement which has been afforded to labourers,
by the improved state of agriculture, and the increasing comforts
of the people.
   Almost the whole of the town of Greenlaw is feued. The feu-
ars (80 in number) are a respectable class of people. There are
several instances of longevity in the parish. A man died lately
upwards of ninety, and five or six of the villagers are between eighty
and ninety.
   Character and Manners of the People.-The inhabitants of this
parish are in general sober and industrious. There are some, in-
deed, as there are in every community, of a different character, but
they are few in number. Those who are frugal and industrious
enjoy in a reasonable degree the comforts and advantages of so-
ciety, and are contented with their situation and circumstances.

<FOOTNOTE>This noble edifice was built at the sole expense of Sir W.P.H. Campbell, Bart.
of Marchmont, and presented by him to the county. The gentlemen of the county
have requested Sir William to sit to one of the most eminent artists for his bust, to
be put up in the large hall in token of their respect and gratitude.
