nie, with a salary of L. 20. In 1618, the parishes of Leochel and
Cushnie were united by a decreet of the Lords of Plat, and the
tacksmen of the teinds were ordained to build a centrical church
at Culmellie, and provide a manse and glebe, on the condition
that, if this was not done within three years, the union should not
take effect. Accordingly, the condition was not fulfilled, and by
the exertions of Bishop Patrick Forbes, about 1621, the union
was dissolved, and the churches separately planted with ministers.
It is highly probable that the annexation of the lands of Corse
quoad sacra to Leochel took place at this time.
    In 1793, a process of annexation of the parishes of Leochel and
Cushnie was raised by the heritors. The people of Leochel seem
to have been passive, but those of Cushnie, with their minister,
and a party in the presbytery, strenuously opposed the measure.
But, notwithstanding this opposition, decreet of annexation was
passed by the Court of Teinds on the 28th January 1795, and two
years after the centrical church was built.

<FOOTNOTE>Mr Seatoun and his contemporary, Mr Copland at Cushnie, were both of Epis-
copal principles.
     Mr Orem was settled in opposition to the wishes of the great majority of the
people, who carried the case to the Assembly; but as they themselves candidly ac-
knowledge, in their answers to the reasons of transportation, this was entirely "ow-
ing to the groundless stories and false reports which they had heard concerning him,"
he was "but a short time settled among them when they were perfectly reconciled
to him;" and they declare, that the people of Forbes and Kearn "neither are nor
can be more harmonious and united in seeking him from them, than they all and
every one of them are to have him who is so universally acceptable to all concerned,
heritors, elders; and people, continued fixed pastor amongst them."  Mr Orem and
his immediate predecessor, Mr Bidie, are still remembered in Cushnie as two of the
"best ministers" whom the parish ever enjoyed.
