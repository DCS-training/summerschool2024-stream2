to the introduction of wheat crops; and the inhabitants
would be enabled to live more comfortably, wheaten bread
being of all others the most wholesome.
   It is of great disadvantage to manufactures, that Lanark
moor, so improvable and so near the town, should remain
in a state of nature: we already owe a great deal to Mr
Honeyman; and if the magistrates cannot dispose of any
more of it, on account of the servitude of the burgesses, they
may follow the example of the town of Ayr, and inclose
that portion of it which is nighest the town, to answer for
this servitude; and were it divided into two inclosures, the
cattle could pasture alternately in both; the south moor
would be fully adequate for this purpose,* and after setting
aside part of the north moor for fuel and divot, the rest of
it may be either disposed of to one proprietor, or, which would
be of greater consequence to the burgh, the magistrates
may feu small lots to the weavers and others, especially a-
long the high-way leading from Lanark to Edinburgh, very
favourable to the erection of a village or villages.  Those
parts nearest the town would certainly yield equal feu duty
with those at Kirkfield bank, viz 6 L. or 8 L. the acre; be-
sides, if a village was once erected, a demand for ground in
the neighbourhood would naturally follow; so that the ma-
gistrates would be enabled to let pieces of their moor at least
as high as 5 s. the acre, and the whole remainder of the moor
would in time be brought under culture.

*This plan would save the necessity and expence of two common herds;
the fees, however, ought still to be paid to the magistrates, and the money
arising therefrom should be laid out on lime, to be spread upon the heathy
parts to sweeten the pasture.  Nor would it be deemed an improper exac-
tion, were the magistrates to ordain, that every burgers, on getting a cart of
divots or turf from the moor, should, in return, lay a cart of dung upon the
inclosed common.
