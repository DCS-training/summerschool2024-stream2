to which his tenants are usually thirled.  The multures are
very high, amounting to one 13th part of the value of the
grain carried to the mill.  For this, it is true, the mill mas-

   Manufactures.-On the Leven, near Balbirnie bridge, a
manufacture of lintseed oil hath been established for a good
