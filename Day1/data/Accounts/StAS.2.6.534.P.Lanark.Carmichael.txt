varies, according to the circumstances of the individual, from
4s. to 6s. Poor families or individuals, who are not in the list of
paupers, receive at least twice a year, and sometimes oftener,
some small aid from the poor's fund. Thd collections in the
church amount to L. 25 a-year, and the heritors are always ready
to give an equal or greater sum, as the situation of the poor may
require it. The interest of L. 115, the collections in church, and
the voluntary contributions from the heritors, have hitherto been
sufficient to meet all demands. The expenditure last year was
L. 54.
	Ale-houses.--THere are only two ale-houses in the parish; they
are occupied by toll-bar keepers; and necessity for either of them
is questionable. They are of no use to the parish, but enable the
tenants of the toll-bars to pay a higher rent to the road trustees.

			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

	Very great improvements have been made since the former Sta-
tistical Account was drawn up. Much greater crops of grain,
turnips, and potatoes, are raised. More work is now done by one
man and a pair of horses, than was formerly done by a plough-
man, a good-man or driver, and four horses. The dairy is better
managed and more productive. A spirit of improvement is in ac-
tive operation, and if it be not checked by some untoward and un-
looked for convulsion, it is possible that a generation fifty years
hence, when a new Statistical Account may be required, may
wonder that people of the present day should have been ignorant
of their discoveries.
