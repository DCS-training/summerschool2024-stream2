butter, cheese, and poultry.  It imports rather more wheat
bread than could be made of the wheat that grows in it.  It
raises oats nearly equal to the consumption of oat-meal.  No re-
markable hardship was suffered here from the season of 1782,
although the harvest did not yield about 4 months provi-
sions.  The late Baron Stewart Moncrieff remitted rents to
his tenants.  The patron of the parish, with a well timed be-
nevolence, directed the grain of the vacant stipend to be 
sold at a cheap rate among the poor.  The corn is ground
by water-mills; but the rude custom of thirlage still remains
on some estates.  Landed property in Fife changes more than
in any other county in North Britain; and the land sold of
late in this neighbourhood has generally been about 35 years
purchase.  Leases of farms are in general for 19 years.

   Roads.-The roads hitherto made were done by statute-la-
bour, but are very indifferent.  The statute-labour is of late
partly commuted; and turnpike roads are making.  One of
them is to pass through this parish, leaving the great road
between Kirkcaldy and Cupar of Fife at the inn called the
Plaisterers.  It takes western direction, through the parishes
of Leslie, Kinglassie, and Auchterderran, and lands the pas-
sengers on the Queensferry road at the kirk of Beathe.
This line of road is already in use in the summer months;
but a free communication through this inland district would
be highly advantageous.  The general opinion of the com-
mon people is not against turnpikes.  This parish has hi-
therto been distinguished for bad roads, and is inaccessible on
the north for 6 months in the year.  Hence the farmers on
the opposite side must sell their commodities at an under
rate, being shut out from the coast towns.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants, according to Dr
Webster's state, is 1194; at present they are 1200.
