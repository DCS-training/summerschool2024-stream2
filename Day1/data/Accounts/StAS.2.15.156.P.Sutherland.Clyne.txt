	   The language usually spoken among the labouring classes is
	Gaelic; but, owing to the more general intercourse with the south
	country, and the increase of education, it has certainly lost ground
	since the date of the former report, and, as most of the young peo-
	ple now attend school and receive at least the rudiments of educa-

	riod.
	   The inhabitants of this parish do not devote much of their time
	to popular games and amusements ; and the few remnants of the
	merry olden times are fast passing from among them.  The bag-
	pipe is never heard except at weddings, and on Christmas and
	New-Year's Days.  Their only game is the shinny, which they
	play with spirit during the holidays, and they then lay their clubs
	aside till the return of the same period next year.  There is no-
	thing distinctive in their habits, appearance, or personal qualities.
	They intermarry with the inhabitants of the other parishes on the
        coast-side; and, consequently, form one community of the same ge-
	neral quality and customs.  Their habits are cleanly, and their style
	of dress, when prepared for church on Sunday, is not surpassed by
	that of any assembled congregation of the same class of people in
	the south country.  Straw bonnets are becoming general ; and no
	young damsel is seen without a neatly made cap, her hair taste-
	fully braided, and her dress formed after the latest imported fashion.
	A great change this, from the time when they were clad in coarse,
	homespun, woollen stuff, and little regard was paid to appearance
	or cleanliness.
	   Though the peasantry cannot procure the same quantity of ani-
	mal food, and of the produce of the dairy, as when they lived in
