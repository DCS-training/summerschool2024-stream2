353 houses in the parish.  The average number of souls in
each family, is about 5.  The following tradesmen are all

West-Indian and American markets, and exported from Lon-

   Rent and Crops.-The valued rent of the parish is 6354 L.
6 s. 8 d. Scots.  The real rent is 3179 L. 13 s. 6 d Sterling.
The rate at which land is let, is various:  some farmers pay
from 7 s. 5 d. to 20 s. per acre.  There is no map of the pa-
rish, but the number of acres is reckoned to be about 7083.
Of these one half is annually employed in raising wheat, bar-
ley, oats, pease, etc.; and betwixt 70 and 80 acres at an
average, in raising flax.  The other half in hay, pasture,
summer-sallow, and potatoes, which afford a very general
subsistence; and in turnips, on which cattle are fed after the
foggage.  The tenants find their advantage in breeding
cattle, a considerable number of which, both fat and lean,
go to England yearly.  The produce of the parish is more 
than sufficient to supply its inhabitants.
