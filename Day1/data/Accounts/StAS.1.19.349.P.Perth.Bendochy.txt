nure.  It is purchased at 1 s. 6 d. or 2 s. the cart-load, A
load of marl, at four miles distance, would cost 50 d. con-
taining 5 bolls.  A load of lime, at six miles distance,
would cost 12 s. 6 d. the 5 bolls.  There is little or none of
the two latter at present used here.  Wheat, though lately
introduced here, is most congenial to the climate of any
grain; as it alone, of all of them, stands the winter, and is
soonest ripe, and ready to be removed from the autumnal
storms.  It is begun to be cut down about the end of Au-
gust, or beginning of September.  It has not, however, suc-
ceeded on high mountainous, grounds.  Four or five hun-
dred feet of difference of elevation, makes a very great dif-
ference of climate; and of grounds of the same elevation,
those nearest tide mountains are the coldest and dampest soil.
   Oats are sown in the end of March and beginning of
April, (a boll to an acre), frequently after grass.  They
never get any dung, as they grow more luxuriantly, with
less fathers of soil, than any other crop can do.  They are
reaped, last of all the crops, about the end of September or
first of October.  There is almost no market for oats, ex-
cepting seed oats, which sell higher than the price of other
oats; but oats are first converted into meal, and then sold.
The common people live on oatmeal pottage twice a-day.
It is the most wholesome and palatable of all their food,
being purely vegetable; notwithstanding the reflection in
Johnson's Dictionary, that " oats are eaten by horses in
"England, and in Scotland by men."  Such food makes
men strong like horses, and purges the brain of pedantry.
It produces hardy Highlanders, who by their strength and
dress are so formidable to their enemies, that they call
them, "Les diables des Montagnes."
   Pease are sown in the end of April.  They are not con-
sidered as a valuable crop, except on account of the straw;
they are precarious to win in harvest.
