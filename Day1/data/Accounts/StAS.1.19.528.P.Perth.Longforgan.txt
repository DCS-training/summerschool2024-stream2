and of the crop of wheat following, it could scarce be di-
stinguished which had been the preceding crop.
   But as it is a common practice to let turnips remain in
the field through the winter, and to be taken up for use
only as the demand for cows or cattle requires, great care
should be taken to suffer none of these to run to feed; for
it is an undoubted fact, confirmed by experience, that
turnips suffered to run to feed exhaust the soil more than
almost any crop whatever, and impoverished more than
much high dressing will recover in many years.  It is pro-
bably the same with all plants bearing oleagenous feeds.
Flax, at any rate, is an impoverishing crop, as it leaves no-
thing behind; but if suffered to feed, it scourges the ground
much more; and from this it is natural to suppose, that in
proportion to the richness of the feed, and the nourishment
that is in it, the ground which produces it will be propor-
tionally exhausted.  Rye-grass, if suffered to feed, exhausts
the ground; if cut in blossom, it does not.
   One remark here is necessary, that when turnips, or their
tops, are given to milch cows, the rotten parts should be
carefully separated and thrown away; for it is with good
reason supposed, that it is the putrid parts which give the
bad flavour to milk, and not the turnip itself.  However, a
very easy cure for this has been discovered lately; to mix a
very small quantity of a weak solution of nitre among the
milk, while warm from the cow, and no turnip taste will
remain.

   Yams.-Yams have also been cultivated with great ad-
vantage, particularly upon the Mains of Castle-Huntly,
ever since the year 1782, when Mr Paterson brought a fir-
lot (a bushel) from Calder, near Glasgow; and now they
are spread all over the country.  They are very easily
raised; but the ground should be ploughed pretty deep in
