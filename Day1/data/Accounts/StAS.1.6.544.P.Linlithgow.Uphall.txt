way of runrig.  Very little summer fallow was practised; still less
of artificial grasses sown; inclosing neither practised nor ap-
proved of by the husbandmen; and the general state of agri-
culture lower than one could have imagined so near a great
city such as Edinburgh, from which the medium distance is
no more than 11 measured miles.  The method Lord Buchan
took of introducing a better method, was giving leases for 19
years, putting an end to runrig, showing examples of summer
fallow, straighting ridges, cleaning, artificial grasses, rolling
of grass seeds, and barley stirr, inclosing, draining; all these
are now practised by the husbandmen more or less, and they

pease.

   Rent.-The best inclosed land lets for 30 s. an acre, good

25 s. the worst 8 s. and 9 s. excluding muir, of which there is
not above 40 or 50 acres.  The valued rent of the parish is
L. 4262 Scotch.

   Sheep, Exports, etc.-Sheep are not much in use, because

fort of labour.  Large quantities of milk, butter, eggs and
poultry are carried into that city; and, what is remarkable,
it is but lately since the people fell upon the expedient of using
