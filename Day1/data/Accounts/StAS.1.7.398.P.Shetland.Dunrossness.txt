     Statistiscal Account

upon the fishing, and to different parts of the country, was
built by one Robert Thompson, a native of Fair Isle, and who
was for several years a schoolmaster there, under the Society
for propagating Christian Knowledge.  He is now a farmer
and mariner, an excellent cooper, a wright, and mason, by
the force of a mechanical genius, without having ever been
an apprentice to any of these prosessions.  His sloop was built
from the keel, and completely rigged and equipped by him-
self.-One of the principal means of improvement to this
country would be good roads, as, at present, no cart or car-
riage whatever can be used for the transport of goods on the
soft surface of the country, particularly to the northward.
Two roads are especially needed, viz. from Lerwick to Scal-
loway, the two principal towns of Zetland, the distance is
only 4 miles; and from Lerwick through Tingwall parish to
the parish of Delton, and thence to Yell sound, through the
very heart of the country, which is not above 12 miles; but,
in some places, the peat moss is so deep as to be impassable
on horseback.-Another great improvement on the state of
this country would be a better division of the small farms,
which are parcelled out in discontiguous plots and run-rigg,
termed here rigg and rendal.  Even the most inconsiderable
merk-lands, lying scattered in several patches, intermixed
with patches possessed by other people.  This unaccountable
arrangement produces endless quarrels and vexations among
neighbours, on account of trespasses which must unavoidably
occur almost daily while the fields remain thus interwoven.
