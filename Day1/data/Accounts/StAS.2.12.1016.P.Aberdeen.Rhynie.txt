1016			ABERDEENSHIRE.

muli commemorative of an engagement fought in the year 1057,
between the brave M'Duff and the usurper Lulach, who, for the
brief period of six months, assumed the title of King, withholding
the sceptre from Malcolm Canmore. Here Lulach was slain by
Macduff. From this engagement it derives its name Mildewne,
(grave of a thousand.)
	To the west of the Noth, on the low grounds, there still exist
the ruins of the castle of Lesmore, a stronghold once possessed
by an ancient branch of the Gordon family. These, with some
monumental stones scattered throughout the parish, rudely carved
with hieroglyphics much defaced, constitute the only relics of an-
tiquity to be found.
