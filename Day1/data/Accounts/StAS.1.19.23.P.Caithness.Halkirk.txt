demands answered.  Hence, several spots that have been
neglected and despised before, as there was no use for them,
are now sufficient to employ several hands, and to main-
tain several families.  Hence, finally, people are called
forth much earlier into life, and employed in business, who
before that period would be only as playful children at the
fireside, and quite useless to themselves and others.
   Thus the number of persons being increased, and busi-
ness and wants having enlarged their narrow sphere, and
taken a wider compass, traffick and commerce, arts and
manufactures started into being.  They now begin to creep
and crawl; and I hope they will soon be able to throw
away their leading-strings, and to make more stately mo-
tions, and more masculine exertions.
   Another circumstance, that contributed considerably to
the increase of population, should not here be omitted.  Be-
fore the period above mentioned, people in general did
not enter so early into the conjugal state.  The storgea, or
impetus of nature, was superseded by motives of interest
and conveniency.  But now, vice versa, these prudential
considerations are sacrificed to the impulse of nature, which
is allowed its full scope; and very young people stretch
and extend their necks for the matrimonial noose, before
they look about them, or make any provision for that state.
Often times, indeed, motives of interest, and the impulse
of nature, combine with united force, and precipitate them
into that state at a very early period of life.  Whether this
practice is favourable to the improvement of the species, I
much suspect; but that it is very much so to population I
have every reason to believe.
   It is true, indeed, that population has of late years re-
ceived no small check from the junction of farms, from
emigration, and from the vast numbers that have gone to
the army during this and the former war.  But yet it is on
