   Miscellaneous Observations.-The roads in this parish are in
tolerable repair, but many of them very ill contrived.  The
statute labour is exacted in kind.  There are no turnpike
roads here.  From 10 s. to 15 s. is the average rent of arable
ground per acre, good and bad included.  Some of the farms
may rent about L. 50 Sterling, and will include 200 acres of
hill, arable, and pasture ground.  There are in the parish
108 horses, 360 black cattle, and about 1500 sheep.
