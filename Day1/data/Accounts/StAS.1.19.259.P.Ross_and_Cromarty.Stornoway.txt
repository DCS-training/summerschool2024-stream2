stoppage of the distilleries took place, the people of the
town found it necessary to unite in the resolution of abo-
lishing the practice, by withholding the dear cordial from
their female domestics, but not without the precaution of
making a compensation to them in money for their griev-

   About 200 yards from the town, on the opposite, or

found at the sides of rivulets, and in the moor, at the depth of
14 feet, where the people dig peats.  According to tradition,

of the soil, and the badness of the climate, the latter of
which this island experiences in common with all the other
islands and Highlands of Scotland.  If the circumstances of
the people in the country part of this parish could admit
of it, they might derive great advantages from the good
