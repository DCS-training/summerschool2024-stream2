   Stipend, Poor, etc.-The living, including the glebe, is,
at the ordinary conversion of virtual, L. 105, 13 s. Sterling.
Lort Stormont is patron.  The church was built about
5 years ago, and the manse 2 years sooner.-There are 8
poor families, who receive monthly pensions, besides some
others, who have occasional relief.  The ordinary annual
amount of the weekly contributions is about L. 8: 12: 4
Sterling, and the produce of alms, and other funds destined
for that purpose, is about L. 23: 3: 4.

   Prices, Wages, etc.-Butcher meat 30 years ago was
about 2 1/2 d. now 4 1/2 d.; and so on as to other articles; a
boll of wheat 15 s. now L. 1, 1 s.; of barley 9 s. now 14 s.;
and of oats 8 s. now 12 s.-  A day's wage for a labourer
in husbandry and other work, is generally 1 s. without vic-
tuals, and 8 d. with them; and so on as to other profes-
sions.-The fuel commonly made use of is coal.  The price
on the coal-hill is 7 d. for the load, which is reckoned 16
stone.  They are procured from Balgonie, Balbirnie, Loch-
gellie, and Kettle-I cannot exactly say what the expence
of a common labourer, when married, at an average may
be; but if he has 3 or 4 young children, it may be about
L. 16, 12 s.; and if he and his wife are in health and vi-
gour, his wages, with any little shift his wife can make,
and it can be but little while the children are very young,
is sufficient to bring up his family.  The usual wages of a
farmer's principal male servant, are L. 8 Sterling; of an
under male servant, L. 4; of a female servant, L. 2, 5 s.;
and of a domestic female servant, L. 2, 10 s.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are only 2 villages.
The people are generally of the middle size.  The tallest
man I ever heard of, and whom I knew, was about 6 feet 5.
They are in general disposed to industry and economy.
