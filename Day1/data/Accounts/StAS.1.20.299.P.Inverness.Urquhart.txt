is called Claodh Cburidan, which expresses properly the bu-
rial palce of Curidan.  There were anciently two other bu-
rial places or cells, called Cillmhichael and Cillsantnianian;
both these have long been disused as places of itnerment.
These cells and burial places were named from reverential
regard to the holy persons of sains by whom they were
consecrated.
   In the lower end of the valley, on the north side of the
Bay of Urquhart, opoosite to the ancient Castle of Urqu-
hart, there remains the vestige of a small religous house,
which belonged to the order of the Knights of the Temple,
or of St John of Jerusalem; the place where it stood is still
called the Temple.  The order of Templars was erected by
the Pope, anno 1128.  The Templars greatly increased in
numbers, riches, and power, over Christendom; they wre
suppressed by Pope Clement the Fifth, in a council held at
Vienna, anno 1312m and their lands were bestowed, mostly
by the respective sovereign powers, upon the Knights of  St
John of Jerusalem.  Wherever there was a religious house
erected, as belonging to the Knights Templars, it is to be
premused, there were some lands annexed to it.  But there
this parish.
   Heritors, and State of the Property and Rents.-Sir James
Grant of Grant have never had any place of residence in
this part of their property, their chief seat having been,
since the time of King Robert Bruce, at Castle Grant,
in Strathspey.  The proprietors of Corrimony were the
only heritors descended of the Grant family, who resided
in the valley of Urquhart, since the original grant of the
lordship of Urquhart, from King James the Fourth to the
family of Grant.
