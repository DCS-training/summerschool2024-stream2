   General Produce, and Expence of Labour.-The crops
raised in this parish are good in general:  Upon the clay
ground, on an average from 7 to 8 bolls per acre; and on
the loam, different according to the quality of the soil,
and the skill of the farmer:  But the expence is very great,
being no less than L. 3, or L. 3, 3 s. per acre.  This may
in a great measure be owing to the very high wages of ser-
vants, both male and female; which has increased of late to
an extraordinary degree:  Farm servants wages were in 1780,
about L. 5.

and women from L. 3 to L. 4; many of the women, how-
ever, get part of their wages in lint, cloth, & c.:  So that
within these 15 years, wages have been doubled and more.
The farm servants indeed are now better clothed, and in
every respect make a much better appearance:  It is much
to be wished, that their good behaviour and industry would
keep pace with their encouragement, which is not always the
case.

   Labourers Wages.-Labourers wages so late as 1777,
were at 7 d in winter. 8 d. 9 d. in summer; now they are
