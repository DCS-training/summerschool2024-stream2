     Of Primrose.

the whole roads in the parish may be about 10 miles.  The
whole of these roads were, till very lately, in a miserable
state of disrepair, and a great part of them has never been
yet formed.  In these circumstances, it is not to be ex-
pected that the application of so small a sum cab be pro-
ductive of any considerable improvement.  Sensible, how-
ever, of the advantages of good roads, which furnish one
of the most desirable accommodations in every country,
the farmers and inhabitants have of late years managed 
this business in a manner very credible to themselves,
and beneficial to the public.  Besides making good some
of the roads, which were formerly impassable, they have
built 2 small bridges, and levelled 2 very heavy pulls; and
if the road leading from Peebles through the villages of
Primrose and Dalhoufie to Dalkeith, which has hitherto
absorbed a great part of the parish funds, and on which
there was erected, several years ago, a turnpike near the
place last mentioned, was to be repaired from the proceeds
of that turnpike, which those who use the road, and pay
the toll duties, are certainly entitled to expert, there is
reason to believe, that the repairs of the other roads
would advance so rapidly, that the whole would soon be
in good condition.
   There is only 1 threshing machine in the parish.  It is
of such a construction, that one similar to it may be
erected for about 30 l.  It is wrought by 2 horses, and is 
equal to the work of any farm.  The publick attention,
with regard to those useful machines, seems to have been
fixed upon a wrong point.  The test superior excellence
appears to have been hitherto chiefly the production of the
greatest quantity of work in a given time.  Hence, ma-
chines have been constructed, which, especially when
wrought by water, are sufficient to thresh the produce,
