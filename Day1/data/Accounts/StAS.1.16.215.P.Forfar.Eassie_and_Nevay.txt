     of Essie and Nevay.

   Estates.-Towards the conclusion of last century, the
names of the proprietors of both parishes were, the Earl of
Strathmore, the heirs of Lord Couper, Nevay of that Ilk,
Blair of Balthayock, and Lamy of Dunkennie.  Three of
these families have disappeared, two remain.  The parish
of Nevay now belongs to the Right Honourable James
Stuart Mackenzie, Lord Privy Seal of Scotland; and that
of Essie is divided among five proprietors, none of whom
has a seat in the parish.  The lands are under the manage-
ment of frugal, industrious and substantial farmers.  The
proprietor of Nevay lately granted new leases to his te-
nants on this and his other estates in Strathmore.  His mo-
deration and generosity on that occasion will not be soon
forgotten.  Every occupier of a farm was secured in the
possesion of it, upon condition of paying a very small rise
of rent.  Had the usual methods of screwing and racking
tenants been adopted, the landlord might have greatly in-
creased his revenue; but he preferred the pleasure of ma-
king several hundreds of people comfortable and happy.

   Farms.-The extent of farms is from 50 to 500 acres.
The number of the most considerable is thirteen.  They
are in general larger than those in the same district 40
years ago.  The enlargement of farms is attended with
some disadvantages.  When cottages are demolished, their
inhabitants are constrained to retire to towns in quest of
lodging and subsistence.  When these nurseries of popu-
lation fail, a sufficient number of working people cannot be
easily procured, and the scarcity of a commodity propor-
tionally enhances its value.  The want of labourers is most
sensibly felt in time of harvest.  Some farmers find it ne-
cessary to employ bands of shearers from the north country,
who cut clown the corn at the rate of 6 s. or 7 s. per acre,
and as soon as this work is finished, retire to the mountains.
