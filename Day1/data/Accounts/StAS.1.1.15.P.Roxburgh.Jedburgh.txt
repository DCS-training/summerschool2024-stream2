interim supply.  There are few instances of any family re-
ceiving above two shillings, or two shillings and six-pence per
week.  These proportions refer to the poor belonging to the
country part of the parish; but the allowance given to the
poor of the town is more scanty and inadequate.

   Besides the assessments above-mentioned, the town of Jed-
burgh holds the principal sum of L. 422 upon bond to the 
session, arising from the accumulation of various legacies, the
interest of which is annually distributed according to the des-
tination of the donors:  Some of it for educating poor chil-
dren, some for the relief of poor householders, some appro-
priated to the poor within the town, and some to the poor
of the town and country equally.  A great portion of these 
charities arises from legacies of the Lady Yester, who was
the daughter of Kerr of Fairnyherst in this parish, and ce-
lebrated for her charity.  A bridewell or correction-house
has been lately erected in the town, at the expence of the he-
ritotrs of the county at large, and has been found very useful
in overawing vagrants, punishing smaller offences; and, par-
ticularly, for the accommodation of persons disordered in
mind, who are maintained there at the expence of the pa-
rishes to which they belong.

   Language.-The common people in the neighbourhood of
Jedburgh pronounce many words, particularly such as end in
a guttural found, with a remarkable broad, and even harsh
accent.  They still make use of the old Scotch dialect.  Many
of the names of places, however, are evidently derived from
the Erse, and expressive of their local situation in that lan-
guage.  For instance,-Dunian, John's Hill,-Minto, Kids 
Hill;-Hawick, Village on a River;-Ancrum, anciently call-
ed Alnicromb a Creek in the River; etc. etc.
