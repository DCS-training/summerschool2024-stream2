	   Poor and Parochial Funds.--There are 50 persons receiving
	parochial aid in the parish.  The yearly church collections are
 	very inadequate, indeed, for meeting the exigencies of so many pau-
	pers, and there is no other fund for their support; but several of
	them go about, seeking parochial relief; and the whole of them
	are partly supported by their own relatives.
   	  Inns.-There is one inn in the parish.
	  Fuel.-Peat moss is the fuel made use of here; of which the peo-
	ple have abundance, and at very little expense.

  		       MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	   The failure of the herring fishing in Loch Roag for thirty ye`rs
	back, has contributed to impoverish the people of this parish.  The
	cultivation of the interior parts of the Lewis, wherever practicable,
	the letting of lands at a very low rent, and giving long leases to
	the occupiers,-would greatly improve the parish, and ameliorate
	the condition of the population, now settled everywhere on the sea
	shore.  The country also requires some branches of roads to the
	interior, so as to cart lime from any of the harbours.  Establishing
	a hemp or cotton manufactory in any part of the Lewis would do
	much for training a people who have so much idle time on band,
	to habits of industry, and for ameliorating their condition.
	  The happiness and comfort of the people would also be pro-
	moted were men of capital to engage in the fishing trade.  It is a
	well known fact, that, of late, there were abundance of herring on
	the whole coast here, which remained for seven or eight weeks;
	but most of the inhabitants had no nets that could fish, so far
	out from shore.  I am confident, that, had there been a num-
	ber of boats and vessels here upon the berring fishing, their suc-
	cess and profits would have been considerable.
