     Statistical Account

the N. W. commences a wide-extended moss, consisting at
least of 1200 square acres, in many places 12 feet deep, and
affording excellent peat.  On all the hills around, too, is
plenty of good peats, and the best pasture; the best arable,
and best improveable lands in the parish lie round about
the harbour.  Thus far then Portree appears to be the most
eligible situation for founding a village that can be devised;
and farther in other requisites and conveniencies, it is no-
thing behind.  Situated in the very centre of Sky, and it
may be said of all this part of the Highlands and Islands,
none of the lochs or bays on there coasts most famous for the
herring-fishing, are far from it, and many are very near.
In the sounds without are good banks for the ling and cod
fishing, and all the surrounding seas abound in various forts
of other fish.  On the beech, because of its steepness, and
the great abundance of good stone in the rocks above, a
breast work or quay might be built at a comparatively
small expence.  On the other side of the harbour are very
promising appearances of coals; and a little beyond, near
its mouth, as likewise in the island of Raasay, are inex-
haustible quarries of different sorts of fine free-stone* ; and
hard by, at Sconcer, is abundance of limestone.  Quite at
hand are two small rivers that never dry up, and several
fountains of good and wholesome water; so that in all
points of view Portree has every advantage and conveni-
ency requisite for the building of a village; and therefore
there can be no doubt, but were it once begun, and suitable
encouragements given, it would soon be in a very flourish-
ing condition.  Indeed, such is its inviting situation that
there are, at present, no less than 30 families about the
place without lands; and who, for the most part, have no
