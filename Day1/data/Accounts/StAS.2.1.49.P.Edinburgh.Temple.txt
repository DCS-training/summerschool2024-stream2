                PARISH OF TEMPLE.

   PRESBYTERY OF DALKEITH, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE.

          THE REV. JAMES GOLDIE, MINISTER.*

     I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name.--THE parish retains its ancient name, derived from an
establishment for the Templers, or Red Friars, founded by King
David I. of Scotland.+
  Extent and Boundaries.--Its extent may be about 9 miles at its
greatest length, and its greatest breadth is about 5. Besides this,
however, there is another portion, four miles eastward, entirely se-
parated by a section of Borthwick parish, consisting of about 300
acres. It is bounded on the south and south-west, by the parishes
of Eddleston and Innerleithen; on the west, by Penicuik; on the
north-west and north, by Carrington; on the north-east and east,
by Borthwick; and on the south-east, by Heriot.
  Topographical Appearances.--The only mountain range is that
of Muirfoot, a continuation of Lammermuir, and running almost
north-east to south-west. The highest of this range appears
from the survey of Generals Roy and Mudie, to be 1850 feet,
while Lawrie's Map of Mid-Lothian states it only at 1500 feet. In
Knox's Map of Mid-Lothian, taken from actual survey, the prin-
cipal elevations of this range are stated thus: Huntly Cot-hills,
1606 feet above the level of the sea; Long-Shank Hill, 1687;
The Kips, 1785: Bowbeat Hill, 2096; Blakehope Scaurs, the
highest in the county, 2193.
  Hydrography.--The South Esk takes its rise from the Muir-
foot Hills, and runs through the parish for about twelve miles in
a north-easterly direction, when it is joined by the North-water,
