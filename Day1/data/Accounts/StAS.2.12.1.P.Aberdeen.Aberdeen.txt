			I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	ABERDEEN, a city of considerable size and extensive com-
merce, is situated along the left bank of the river Dee, near its
mouth, extending about a mile from east to west, and stretching to
nearly an equal distance northward from the river.
	Name.--Various conjectures have been formed respecting the
etymology of the of this city, of which the two following are
the most worthy of notice:
	Mr Kennedy, in his Annals of Aberdeen, says, on the autho-
rity of the late Mr Maclachlan, Rector of the Grammar-School of
Old Aberdeen, that "the Gaelic name, Obairreadhain, pronoun-
ced Oberrayn, signifies the town situated on the bank or space of
ground near the entrance of two rivers; and is composed of Abair-
or Aber, a well-known wor, and Da-abhuinn, (Da-awin), two
rivers, namely, Dee and Don.  This analysis is exactly descrip-
tive of the local situation of Aberdeen, which in former ages was
almost at an equal distance from the mouths of both rivers, although
about a century ago the channel of the Don, near the town, was
altered, and the stream diverted straight into the sea, about a mile
