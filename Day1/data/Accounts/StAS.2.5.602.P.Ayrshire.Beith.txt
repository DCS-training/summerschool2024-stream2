tors of the parishes whose valued rent is L. 50 Scots and upwards;
3. Proprietors of houses in the town of Beith, or within half a mile
of the cross, of L. 7 of yearly rent or value; and, 4. The te-
nants of such houses. The twenty years expired in July 1838,
and the management has now been taken up by the new con-
stituency.
	Benevolent Societies.--Many years ago, several societies were in-
stituted for affording relief to aged and indigent members. But
as nothing was contributed after the original subscription, and as
there was thus no annual supply, the funds could not stand the de-
mands when the members became old and required aid. The
consequence was, that they were consumed, and the societies ceased.
No attempt has been made to form one on the basis recommend-
ed by the Highland Society of Scotland, of making the entrance-
money on a scale corresponding to the age of the members, which
has been proved the sure foundation of permanency and efficiency.
This is much to be regretted, as there is nothing so gratifying to
the independent minded man as the reflection of having laid
aside, in the day of comparative prosperity, for the day of his ad-
versity, to which all are more or less liable. Of late, a sort of
substitute for the friendly society has been adopted in what is cal-
led a Menage. This is a common fund contributed equally at so
much a-week; and at a time fixed, each person draws his share
by lot. He thus gets L.1 or L. 1, 1Os. at one time, which aids
him in paying his house rent, but it is only drawing out in cumulo
what be contributed periodically, and is no better than the old
custom of the Pinner-Pig, only the money is put beyond reach
until the date of drawing it out. There was a Savings Bank for se-
veral years, which was broken up, and a new one formed in 1834.
The following table gives a vidimus of the operations of this so-
ciety.

	Mr. John Kerr of Nettlehirst left L. 20 to found a society for
purchasing clothing, blankets, and fire, for poor persons resident
in the town and parish. The society was instituted in 1817, the
year in which Mr Kerr died, and has been very well supported.
The average expenditure is about L. 20
