   Woods, Fisheries, Ferry, etc.-Though large tracks of the
parish were of old covered with wood, it had become quite
exhausted.  In the course of 20 years back, some consider-

the Point of Chanonry Ness, where the salmon are caught,
fresh from the sea, in their highest perfection.  About 40
years ago, it was rented at 3 100 merks Scotch.  It now pro-

that there is not an instance of any being lost on it in memory
of man.

farmers begin to prefer that with the feather fock, as most
convenient, especially for turning lee or meadow ground.  The
number of ploughs in the country and town is reckoned to
be about 60.  These are commonly drawn by 6, and some-
times 8 middle sized, or rather small oxen, which are found
best adapted for steep or hilly lands, and go through their
labour with much steadiness.  Small horses are employed in
carrying manure, yoked in a fort of light sledge, rolling on
