aperture of the hung into that of the weal; the end of the
weal which is left out being entirely closed.  Thus joined
together, they are placed upon their sides, at a convenient
distance from the shore, where, during the spring tide, they
are wholly overflowed at high water, and left dry at ebb,
the mouth of the cruive pointing directly up the river; by
which means the fish that came up with the flood, returning
again with the ebb, run into the cruive, from thence through
the bung into the weal, where, not being able to recover their
way into the water, they are caught by the fishers when the
tide is fully out.  One of these cruives will sometimes yield,
of herrings and garvies in a season, to the value of 6 L. 8 L.
and, in an extraordinary good year, even 10 L.  There are at
Kincardine, 4 miles west from Culross, 61 cruives; at Langan-
nat, a mile and a half nearer Culross, 83; and at another new
station midway between these, nicknamed by the fishers Botany
Bay, 35.  In lucky seasons, such as was the year 1783, it was
computed, that betwixt Kincardine and Langannet, there
were caught of fish to the value of 1000 L. and upwards.
The cruive-fishing season is from the month of August till
the beginning of March.  In the darkness and gloom of win-
ter, and even amidst all the horrors of the tempest, the fishing
of the cruives exhibits a very gay and enlivening scene; men
and women of all ages, and in different companies, resorting
to them, and carrying lamps of flaming charcoal, which are
seen at a distance through the dark, moving in all directions,
accompanied with the mixed cries of emulation, merriment,
and hope.  The cruives belonged originally to the Abbot of
Culross; but, after the Reformation, were parcelled out
among the several proprietors who succeeded to the church
lands.
