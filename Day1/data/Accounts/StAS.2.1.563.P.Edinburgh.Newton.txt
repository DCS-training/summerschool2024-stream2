   Chief Land-owners.-The property of Edmonstone in former
times belonged to a family of that name, the founder of which is

<FOOTNOTE>Which having been done, and a reference made to the Archbishop of St Andrews to
ascertain his pleasure as to that matter, instead of allowing the presbytery to go on by
themselves, he answered that he would be present himself at the admission, which
occasioned delay; but on the 6th January 1614, it is reported by some of the breth-
ren who were present, that the Archbishop had admitted him on the 4th, whereupon
they gave him the right hand of fellowship.
   Thus it appears, that, for more than fifty years after the "Paips kirk" had been
abolished by law, the parish of Newton remained without an ordained clergyman,
and that, up to this period, and, as will presently be shown, for ten years after this, no
legal provision out of the benefice had been obtained.
   Mr Aird did not remain long, and probably had little encouragement to do so.
On the 28th September 1615 he was translated to Newbattle, and, on the 2d Novem-
ber, "My Lord Clerk of ye Register directit ane letter to ye presbytery, desyring
Mr John Melville, some to Mr James Melville, martyre and witness for Christ,
sould be heard at Newtone kirk with yair permissioun. Mr Archd. Symsone was
ordainit to shaw ye Clerk of Register yat ye young man behoveth to be heard before
yaim and then at Newtoun. Mr John Aird appointed to teich at Natoun kirk on
Sunday come aucht days, and try the mind of ye parishoners how yai are affection-
ate 23d November. Reported Mr Aird, yat he had taucht at Natoun and had renew-
it ye wonted offer of ye gentilmen yair extending to twa hundret merkis, and obtainet
some esperance of ane hundret merkis more of ye commonaltie gif yei sall and culd
have ye occasioun of an intrant quhom yei lyked. Quhilk day also ye gentilmen
parochoners of Natoun directit ane missive yat yei micht have permissioun to heir
some utheris quhom yei had not as yet-hard. The presbyterie grantit yeir suit,
provyding Mr John Melville taucht ye next Saboth day, and ye nominat suld first be
hard in ye presbyterie, according to yeir former act, and after at Natoun." 7th De-
cember. "Reportit Mr Jon. Aird, that ye parachiners of Natoun wes desyrous to heir
Mr Andro Stevenson at yair kirk, the presbyterie, according to yair former act, con-
sentit to ye same." llth January l6l6. "The parochiners of Natoun being secure, and
ye presbyterie surmising sundrie guid men to teich unto yaim, thoclit guid yat yei might
be more desyrous to seik some, not to gif yaim any furder benefit." This it would seen
had not the desired effect, and accordingly it is thus followed up. 14th February. "The
brethren considering yat ye parochiners of Natoun had had sundrie guid young men
to teich to yaim, and yet wes not so desyrous to have any one as need were, (the vo-
luntary system did not work well in this instance it would appear,) ordains Mr Jno.
Aird to adverteis yaim, yat ye next day yei suld report yair own mynd and suit."
   On the 21st February three of the heritors appeared, and "being posit quhat yai
thocht of these expectants quhom ye presbyterie had directit to yaitn, deponit, yat be
ressoun of ye laird of Edmonstone and Sir Alex. Hay, his absence, quho had
principal interest yair, yai could determine nothing. The brether ordeinit ane
letter to be pennit to be sent to ye laird of Edmestoun for ye knawing of his mynd
and dyet of coming, the convoy quhere of ye foresaid gentilmen promisit to tak ane
care of, as also to speik Sir Alexr. Hay." 7th March. "Quhilk day compeirit
ye laird of Edmestoun with ye gentilmen aforementionate, quha being posit anent
yair resolution, promisit ye next day to declair yair choise." 14th March. "Com-
peirit Mr John Edmestoun in name of ye rest, wishing yaim to direct Mr John
Melville to yairn, on this condition, that they wald sett down with him no particular
sowme of stipend, but that he wald content himself with yair offer and guid will
howsoever. The brether houping weill on all sydis without any farder urging yaim,
ordeinit Mr John to teich yair quhile farder advysment." 20th Jan. "Mr John
Melville being now content of ye provisioun quhilk ye parichoners of Natoun wald
give him voluntarlie, desyrit that ye brether suld further his admissioun. Mr John
Aird was ordeinit to signifie ye same to ye bischope." This was done, and Mr Aird
"reportit yat ye bischope meanit yaim to proceed ad ultimum, and then to schew
him." When this was going forward, Mr John Barbour, the reader, being "con-
vict of riot in ye kirk and sclander," on the 22d August, "ye brether appointit Mr
Archd. Symsone and Jno. Aird to see his desk removit by the authority of Gilbert
Hay of Monktoun, baillie of ye bounds," who, on the 29th, "reportit yat yei had ac-
quaintit ye aforesaid with ye presbyterie's commissioun, quha promisit yat in all
tyme coming yei could be commerless of Jon. Barbour." In those days the "baillie
