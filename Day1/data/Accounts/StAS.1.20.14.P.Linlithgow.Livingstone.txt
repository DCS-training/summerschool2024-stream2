disputed by contending armies.  There are three rivers on
each side of this pass, which, as they intercept the roads
leading to it, the passage of these also have, at various times,
been contended; viz. on the north, the rivers Tay, Earn,
and Allan; and, on the south, the Almond, the Avon, and
the Carron; each of these rivers have at different times
been tinged with blood.
   The flat banks of the Almond, near Kirklifton and Li-
vingstone, and the relative situation of these two places,
point them out as the most likely for an army to attempt
a passage, in their way to or from Stirling.  The first is in
the direct line betwixt Stirling and Edinburgh, or the east
of Scotland, and England; and the latter from the south of
Scotland, through that remarkable gap in Pentland hills
called the Caldstain Slap, towards Stirling.  No historian,
so far as we know, has mentioned any battles having been
sought at either of these places; but two large detached
stones, standing erect, one near Kirkliston-bridge, and the
other near the New Bridge, at no great distance from the
former, evidently point out that bloody contentions had
been here maintained; and if our historians are in general
very inexplicit, their information is also often either evi-
dently erroneous, or very suspicious.  They tell us, that, to-
wards the close of the 10th century, a battle was sought at
Cramond, (the mouth of the water of Almond), betwixt
Malcolm II. and Constantine the Ufurper, and that, during
the conflict, one of the armies were much incommoded by the
sand of the sea being blown in their faces by a violent wind.
This story is at least highly improbable.  In the first place,
The steep banks of this river at Cramond precludes every
idea of an army attempting a passage here, in the face of
an enemy; it was probably chosen as a Roman station, on
account of its security from such an attack: and, secondly,
The sands here are every tide covered by the sea; and we
