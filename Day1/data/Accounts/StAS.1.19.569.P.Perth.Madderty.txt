     of Madderty.

   Antiquity.-The only remains of antiquity in the parish
worthy of notice, except the ruins of the Abbey already
mentioned, is a portion of the Roman road or causeway
from the camp at Ardoch to Perth.  It runs about a quar-
ter of a mile through the southern extremity of the parish,
and is very entire.  It is probable that it will not long con-
tinue in that state, if it can by any means be converted into
a highway, or afford materials for making or repairing
one.
