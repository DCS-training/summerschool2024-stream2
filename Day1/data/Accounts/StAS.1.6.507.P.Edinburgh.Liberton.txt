     of Liberton.

of Liberton amounted to 52 chalders, 3 bolls, and 3 sirlots of
victual; their real valuation at present must be ten times as
much.  The schoolmaster of Liberton has a salary of about
200 merks, besides 40 merks as session clerk, and 52 merks
as the interest of a mortification.  Besides the public, there
are private schools in different places of the parish, for teach-
ing English, arithmetic and writing.

   Extent, and Population.-The parish is large, containing 62
ploughgates of land, which, at the ordinary computation of
45 acres to a ploughgate, give a total of 4140 statute acres of a-
rable ground.  It is more populous than any other country
parish in the Presbytery of Edinburgh, that of St. Cuthberts
excepted, containing 3457 souls, whereof 755 reside in Gil-
merton.  On an average of 20 years preceeding 1786, there
were 130 baptised, 25 couples married, and 102 buried.  For
20 years preceeding 1725, the annual average of baptisms
was 117, of marriages 20 couples, and of burials 106.  The
return to Dr. Webster in 1755 was 2793 souls, and the in-
habitants seem still to be on the increase, on account of the
lime works, and the colliery at Gilmerton.,

   Charitable Funds.-For many years past, the collections at
the church doors have amounted at a medium to L. 42 per
annum, the mortcloths to L. 22, the rents of houses gar-
dens and seats in the church belonging to the poor, to
L 21: 7: 4, amounting in whole to L. 85: 7: 4; all which is
expended each year.  Besides there, L. 5, the interest of a le-
gacy, is yearly distributed to the distressed and languishing
and L. 40 is bestowed every Christmas, by the direction of
those who have landed property, on certain poor labourers,
whose work is mostly without doors, and who, on that ac-
count, may be prevented from working by the severity or in-
