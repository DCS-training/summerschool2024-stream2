     The Statistical Account.

   The farmers here low turnips, with which they fatten
their cattle in winter.  The inclosing with front dykes goes
on very rapidly; and in a few years the farmers will be en-
abled to fatten their cattle in summer.  Some of our farmers
who have inclosed fields, let them from 40 s. to 50 s. per acre.
   Sir David Carnegie's tenants, who compose the greatest
part of the country parish under the first charge, have good
farm steadings, and are well lodged.  Most of the leases
were of late renewed, and the rents considerably raised: but
still they have very good bargains.  Little of their land is set
above 15 s. per acre; whereas other gentlemen, in this and
the neighbouring parishes, have set their lands from 20 s. to
30 s. per acre.  The tenants here are, generally speaking,
good farmers, well acquainted with the proper methods of
cultivation; and many of them are very substantial, so that
they can afford to lay out a good deal of money in improv-
ing their farms: and there is every chance in the world,
that what they have laid out, or may lay out, to this effect,
will, in process of time, be repaid to great advantage.

   Antiquities, and the Riding of the Muir.-There are the re-
mains of a Danish camp near Keithoc, a part of the country
parish northward.  This camp lies west of the Battle-Dykes:
the road leading from Brechin to the Grampian Hills passes
through the middle of it.  It is in the form of an oblong
square.  Its circumference is about one fourth of an English
mile, that is to say, what is visible above ground.  In the
midst of this encampment is a well of water, generally known
by the name of the Camp Well, and a mount, on the south
side, about 8 or 10 feet high, and about 40 feet in circumfe-
rence at the base.  But from the best information I can learn,
is original length was about one half of a Scots mile; the one
point beginning at the north end of the Ward of Keithoc, going
