ployed in it live much more comfortably.  For the space of
15 or 20 years, while it was under the management of one,
or a very few men, who attended to and were sufficient jud-
ges of the business, it flourished much, and produced for ex-
port annually near 25,000 spindles of yarn, which, in the o-
pinion of those who saw and examined it, was as good as any
in Scotland.  After that period it began to decline; for some
people observing with regret the profits which they imagi-
ned those by whom it was introduced and conducted made,
resolved to share of them, by importing flax, dressing it, and
giving it out to spin among the people.  The consequence
naturally was, that the spinners no sooner observed a compe-
tition among their employers, than they were more careless
about performing their labour; the yarn was ill spun, worse
measured, and worse counted; and by this means, in a very
few years, it lost all the character which it had formerly gain-
ed in the market.  The shopkeepers in Kirkwall and Strom-
ness, and also some of those in the islands, give almost all of
them out lint to spin, and even some of the landholders exact
the spinning of yarn from their tenants as a part of their
rent; and this circumstance of its being at present in so many
hands must, it is evident, have gone far towards hastening
the ruin of the manufacture.  Still there is some lint spun
here, and carried to Edinburgh, Glasgow, and wherever the
price of yarn is highest; and when the price is low, which
has been the case for some years past, the yarn is manufac-
tured into linen cloth, mostly for the English market.  Be-
sides the yarn which was sent south last year, and the quan-
tity bartered with the merchants who come over from Mur-
ray, which is sometimes considerable, there was stamped by
Mr Magnus Lindsay about 30,000 yards of coarse linen in-
tended for sale, and not for private families.  Much more
advantage might this manufacture have been of, had the yarn
