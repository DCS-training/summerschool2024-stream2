built three farm or mansion-houses, and three farm-stead-
ings, with mansion and cow-houses.

   Church.-The walls and roof of the church were repair-
ed in 1775.  The ministers of this parish were, Messrs Meth-
ven, Methven, Pringle, Moodie, Home, and Home which
last was, in 1785, succeeded by Mr John Todd the present 
incumbent.  The manse and offices were rebuilt in 1787.
All the inhabitants are of the Established church,except a 
few Diffenters, mostly of the Relief; and these attend the 
parish church occasionally.

   School.-The school-house is in good repair.  The school-
master's salary is L. 7 : 1 : 1 Sterling.

   Poor.-There are only four persons t present on the
poor roll; some others, from accidental circumstances, often
receive a temporary supply.  The heritors and kirk-session
generally meet three times in the year to make provision
for the poor for the ensuing four months, when they ad-
mit on the roll, or increase the allowance of those whose 
necessities may seem to require it.  The number of paupers,
upon a ten years average, preceding the year 1784, is five:
and upon a ten years average, preceding 1794, is seven.
The funds for the maintenance of the poor arise from the 
weekly collections in the church, the interest of some mor-
tified monies belonging to the poor of the parish; and, for 
what more is necessary, the heritors have recourse to the 
legal method, and assess themselves according to the pro-
portion of their valued rent.  The yearly assessments, upon
the average of ten years, preceding 1784, were L. 11, 17s.
1 3/4 d. Sterling: and the average of ten years, preceding 
1794, were L. 23, 2 s. Sterling.
