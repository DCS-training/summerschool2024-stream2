houses, and let the whole to one gentleman, at rather more
than double the rent the lands formerly gave.  The rent is
now about L. 185 Sterling.  Another farm rents L. 105
Sterling.  The rest of the rents of the parish are from
L. 40 down to L. 7 Sterling.  The whole rent of the pa-
rish is about L. 1000 Sterling, the valued rent L. 2501
Scots.

   Mode of Cultivation.-Several of the tenants yoke 10

have now 60 carts.  In 1744, when the present in-
cumbent was settled, there were only 2.  At that
period there were only two houses in the parish which
had stone chimnies, the house of Barra and the manse.

lime from Aberdeen and Newburgh, English and Scotch
shells, and some powdered lime flora Udny and the
Buchan country.  Some years ago it was to be had at Pit-
