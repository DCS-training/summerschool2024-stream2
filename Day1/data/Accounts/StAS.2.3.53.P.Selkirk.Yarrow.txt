1819, under the patronage and through the patriotic exertions of
the Right Honourable Lord Napier.  It meets yearly; but in this
parish the meetings are only triennial.  Besides occasional grants
of money from the Highland Society, it has expended considerable
sums for bettering the breeds of Cheviot and black-faced sheep,
horses, and cattle.  Nor have the humble followers of the flock
been forgotten, as premiums are also given for dexterity in sheep-
shearing.

yearly in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows:
