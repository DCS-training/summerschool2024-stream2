extraordinary annexations?  Besides these remote portions,
(which are considered as belonging, quoad sacra, to the pa-
rishes in which they are respectively situated), the parish is
of considerable extent, stretching from N. W. to S. E.
nearly 13 miles, and varying in its breadth from 1 to
6 1/2 miles.

   Soil and Land, Floods.-The soil is various.  On the
high grounds it is mostly a cold wet clay.  On the banks
of the Tay and Isla, it is in general a light loam.  The
ground is so flat, that when these rivers are flooded, they
overflow many hundred acres.  Four remarkable floods
have happened in the Tay, in the course of 30 years, in
1761, 1780, 1789 and 1791.  In the spring of the year
1790, in consequence of gradual breaches made by the river
on the green Inch, below Inchtuthel, two oak trees were
uncovered.  The trunk of the largest, from the root to the
lowest branch, was 40 feet 6 inches long, and contained
132 feet 9 inches of solid measure.  As similar oaks have
been often discovered near the place, by means of similar
encroachments on the bank, in the spring and autumnal
floods, it appears in the highest degree probable, that they
had grown on the spot.  Hence we are led to believe, a-
greeably to traditionary accounts, that the country was well
wooded in former times.  The Tay has undoubtedly taken
various directions, at different periods, through the plain.
Delvin, though now and for many ages situated on the
north, is said to have been on the south side of the river*.
It seems, however, more likely that it was always occa-
