	Poor.-,At present there are nine upon the poor's roll. The
sum of L.446 is vested in the session for behoof of the poor, and
is lying at interest in the hands of the principal proprietor. The
collections at the church amount annually to about L.14. Be-
sides this, there is a sum distributed amongst the poor not upon
the roll, and which affords a most seasonable relief to many during
the winter months.
