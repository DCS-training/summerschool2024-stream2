and change their course, to the great injury of the commu-
nity.  Within these 40 years, a great part of the higher
grounds, which formerly were covered with heath, have been
coverted into arable and pasture land.  Prior to that time
there were no carts in the parish, and very little lime made
use of, for the cultivation of the land; but of late a spirit
of improvement has prevailed among the inhabitants, most
of whom cover two or three acres yearly with lime, and 
would do much more in this respect, were it not for the 
scarcity of fuel. The peats are not so fit for the purpose,
and are at some distance.  There are coals at the distance of 
9 or 10 miles; but they are not so good as those to be had
in Ballycastle in Ireland, from whence, or from Ayrshire,
they would readily carry them, were it not for the tax impo-
sed upon coals carried coastways, which is a great hindrance
to the improvement of this part of the country.  There is 
no draw-kiln for burning lime, but one built by an English
farmer for his own use.  All the other farmers make their
kilns of turf.

   Produce.-The produce of the country is oats, barley, po-
tatoes, and beans, and in greater abundance than serves to
supply the inhabitants.  There is also some wheat and rye
cultivated in the parish.  Some hundred bolls of barley,
meal, and potatoes, are yearly sold in the neighbouring town
of Campbeltown; and some of those articles are exported 
from hence to Clyde.  About 400 bolls of barly are distil-
led within the bounds of the  parish.

   Population.-The number of examinable persons, from 8
years old and upwards, is near 1000; consequently the total
population is about 1300.  In Dr Webster's report, the 
number is 1391.  The average of Christenings, for the last
