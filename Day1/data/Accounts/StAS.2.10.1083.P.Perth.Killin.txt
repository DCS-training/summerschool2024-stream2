    An equally rich catalogue might be made of the rare ferns,
mosses, and other cryptogamic plants, were it not that space would
be occupied which requires to be devoted to subjects of more ge-
neral interest.
    Plantations.-There are about 1000 acres of wood in the pa-
rish, and of these a great part consists of very thriving plantationr.
In the higher parts of Strathfillan, where there is now rather a
want of wood, it is evident it once abounded, as the trunks of large
trees are very frequent in the ground.  The following kinds of
wood are indigenous, and grow to a large size: oak, ash, moun-
tain-ash, birch, elder, hawthorn, and hazel.  The plantations con-
sist chiefly of Scotch and silver fir, spruce, and larch.  At Finla-
rig. some fine specimens of yew may be seen, and a plane proba-
bly three hundred yearr old. Laburnum and holly are also abun-
dant.  The following table of trees, measured about three feet
from the ground, will give some idea of the adaptation of the land
to the growth of wood:-
