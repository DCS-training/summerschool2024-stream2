extent, these machines will very much reduce to the farm-
er the price of labour; with his ordinary hands, he can
thresh his corn, and carry on all his other occupations on
the same day.  They may now be built for the expense of
40 l. or 45 l. Sterling, to be worked by 2 horses. One in
the neighbouring parish of Cramond (at Gray-Crook, be-
longing to Mr. Allan), constructed on these principles,
will thresh from 6 to 8 bolls in the hour.

   Manure.-The alone which is here used, is dung ei-
ther made upon the farm, or brought from Edinburgh.
There can be no dispute concerning the superiority of this
manure over all others; but it hath been a matter of con-
siderable surprise to farmers in other counties, why lime
is rejected as a manure in the neighbourhood of Edin-
burgh, where, though dung may be procured, it is often
at an exorbitant rate.  It is answered to this, that the
lands here, which have received dung mixed with so mucle
ashes, would be injured by liming; the ashes having per-
formed that which the lime is intended to produce, viz.
to loosen the soil, and act as a stimulus.  Notwithstand-
ing of this opinion, which is believed to be well founded,
perhaps lime, in certain cases, might be applied with ad-
vantage; not to ground which is impoverished and exhaust-
ted of vegetable aliment, but in the rankest soil, and where
even the greatest quantity of dung hath been laid down:
as it is well known, that calcareous bodies have a strong
assinity to oils, the lime applied to ground abounding with
these, will assist in bringing forward that process which
is favourable to vegetation; and if it abounds with the
uncorrupted roots of weeds and noxious plants, it will
hasten their destruction, and thus produce a double bene-
fit.  I may perhaps here, with propriety, remark, that I
