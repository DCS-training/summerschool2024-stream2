       mains of the ancient residence, now bearing all the marks of a
       complete ruin, although a few of the apartments are still entire,
       contrast strikingly with the light and handsome appearance of the
       modern building very near it.  About a mile above the house,
       near the banks of the May, is the burying-place of the family,
       called the "Chapel of Muckersey." In former times, it was used
       as the church of Muckersey before the union of that parish with
       the parish of Forteviot.  The approach to it is tastefully formed,
       lined on each side with fine trees, and well kept.  The whole
       policy of Invermay, in addition to the beauties of nature, is laid
       out with such exquisite taste, and kept in such excellent order,
       that it is a great attraction to all strangers, and especially to those
       at Pitcaithly Wells, who are once a-week permitted to visit this
       delightful spot.
         Parochial Registers.- There is a register of births, commencinf
       in 1710; and, excepting a blank from 1713 to 1720, it has been
       regularly kept from that time to the present.

       ture.  The whole of the lands in the lower parts of the parish
       are well farmed.  The farms are large, and the farmers are men

       sally prevails, and is attended here, as everywhere, with a demo-
       ralizing effect.
