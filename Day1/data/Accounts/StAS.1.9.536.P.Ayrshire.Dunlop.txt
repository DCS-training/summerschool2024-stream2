ject to few diseases, and generally live to a good old age.
In the western parts of the parish, the soil is either light
or of a thin clay, and towards the E. the prevailing soil is
deep and heavy, with a cold wet bottom.  And this, it is
probable, has given rise to a practice unknown in other
parts of the country, and which strangers are apt to con-
sider as foolish and unaccountable.  The custom is, to
plough with 4 horses and 3 men; 2 of the men are em-
ployed in the usual way; but the third, with a long pole
fixed to the beam of the plough, directs the beam, and as-
sists the ploughman.  By this mode, of an ancient date
among them, they imagine they do more and better work
in the same time, than could be done by any other method.
But whether the advantages of this, supporting them to be
real, will overbalance the expense of an additional horse
and servant, is certainly a question of some importance,
especially to those who have nothing but custom to justify
their continuance of it.  In a place like this, where the
farms are small, and where the ploughing is carried on by
two neighbours jointly, this expense is indeed not so rea-
dily perceieved ; ye' still it must be for their interest to per-
ceive it, and for their credit, as proper farmers, to retrench
it.  From what has been said concerning the difference of
soil, it is easy to see that there will be a difference also in
what it produces.  The crops accordingly, which are usual-
ly oats, are better and more productive in the first and se-
cond, than they are in the third division of soil ; those of
the former yielding from 17 to 19, and those of the latter
but from 12 to 15 pecks of meal the boll.  The average
rate, however, of meal the boll, for the whole parish, will
not exceed 14 pecks, though the boll here contains a buthel
more than it does in most other counties in Scotland.  And
what may appear a little strange for a parish not of great
