is now imported in pipes, and is a very common drink at private
as well as at public entertainments.  Porter, which, about
20 years ago was scarcely known, is now brought from Lon-
don in great quantities and is becoming a common beverage
with the lowest of the people.  Table beer is seldom made
by private families, but by the brewers in the town, who are
a flourishing class of men; from 1600 to 2000 bolls of malt
are consumed annually, but the consumpt of this article is les-

   Supersine cloths, and all kinds of cotton, cloth and many o-

plenty in many shops in Forfar.
   Dundee is the nearest sea-port town, and with which Forfar

with Arbroath and Montrose.-The communication with all
these places will be greatly facilitated when the turnpike roads

Arbroath are now nearly completed.  Though the popular
prejudice was at first against them, every one begins to see her
interest in them, now, since as much can be drawn by one horse
as could formerly have been done with two, and the toll exi-
gible for a one horse cart per day from Forfar to Arbroath or
Dundee, is no more than 4 d 1/2. on their road.  The turnpike road
from Forfar to Perth is likewise in great forwardness, and will
soon be compleated, to the general improvement of the estates
through which it passes and the town, to and from which it
leads.
   One great drawback on the property of Forfar is the sear-
city of fuel.  Peats have indeed for several years past been ob-
tained from the lands gained by draining the loch of Forfar;
these are now nearly exhausted, and a new moss has been o-
pened by the draining Loch Restenct, which, in its turn, a
