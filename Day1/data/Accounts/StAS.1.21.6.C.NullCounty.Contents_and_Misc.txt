ever, of adding, that Professor Dalzel is drawing
up an historical work, on the University of Edin-
burgh, which, from what I have seen of it in ma-
nuscript, promises to be a very interesting and va-
luable performance.
   I cannot conclude, without once more returning
my best acknowledgements to the respectable Members
of the Church of Scotland, for having enabled me to
complete an undertaking, which certainly stands unri-
valled for extent of useful information; and which
may be imitated, but, considering the ability and
exertions which they have exhibited on the occa-
sion, cannot be surpassed, in any other country.
