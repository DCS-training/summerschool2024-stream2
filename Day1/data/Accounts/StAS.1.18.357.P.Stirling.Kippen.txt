tion does not admit of establishments in manufactures, we are
not altogether excluded from a share of the benefits derived
from them.  The increasing demand for grain, cattle, etc. is
beneficial to the farmer; whilst the smaller erections for
spinning cotton, tambouring, and weaving muslins, bring to
us these manufactures, and the advantages resulting from them,
upon such a scale as is not likely to produce any material in-
jury to the health or morals of those employed in them.  At
least those who have the superintendence of such small manu-
facturing societies, have it in their power to prevent or to
correct abuses, to a degree that is altogether impracticable in
great towns, or larger establishments of this kind.
   Such are some of the advantages enjoyed by a country which
hath emerged from the unprofitable indolence of former times,
and in which improvements are still advancing, though they
have not yet arrived at that ultimate point of perfection to
which they naturally tend.
   The disadvantages which accompany an advanced state of
society, seem to render it no less unfriendly to human happi-
ness, than those earlier stages in which improvements are but
little known.  To prevent or to correct these evils, is surely
one of the noblest objects which can employ the exertions of
politicians and philanthropists.  To this desireable end, the
present statistical investigation of the kingdom, when com-
pleted, may be expected in a high degree to contribute.  And
the writer of this account will think himself happy, if these re-
marks shall lead the people in this part of the country, and o-
thers placed in similar situations, to contentment with the lot
that Divine Providence hath assigned to them, and animate
them to a becoming use of those advantages which they at
present enjoy.
