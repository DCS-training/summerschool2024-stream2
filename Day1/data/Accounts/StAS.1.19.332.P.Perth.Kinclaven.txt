situation in which they are placed.  The county of Perth,
were it possessed of no other spot of a similar description,
should allow Arntully to remain in its present state, that a
proper contrast might be drawn, between a neat modern
village, and one upon the old construction.  Most of the 
inhabitants, many of whom are weavers, occupy a small
bit of ground adjoining to their houses, which furnishes
them with garden stuffs, etc. by which many of them are
enabled to keep milch-cows.  this they very justly consi-

thriving state.

   Rivers, Fishings.-The Tay is the only river here that
merits notice.  it runs in winding directions for the space
of several miles on the north and east; no where, in its
whole course, has it mad such ravages on the land as in
this parish, chiefly on the estate of Mr Drummond of Logie
Almond.  It has at several times forced its way through
the banks, and made great excavations in the corn-fields,
where it has formed spacious tracts for itself.  Three or
four of these tracts, being now abandoned by the river, re-
main lasting monuments what the Tay in its fury can do.
It is probable, that at no great length of time it will make
still more extensive devastations on the richest and most
beautiful part of the parish. - the fishing on the river are
