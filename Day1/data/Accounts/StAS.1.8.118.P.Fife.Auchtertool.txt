misled or convulsed, by designing and seditious men; if the
rise and the fall of kingdoms, have, in all ages, been chiefly
produced by moral causes; and if the morals, the opinions,
and the behaviour of men, be intimately connected with the
instructions they receive, and the principles they imbibe,
during their early years;-if these things be so, the instruc-
tion and education of youth ought certainly to be reckoned a
matter of primary concern, in every well regulated state;
more especially by those, who sit at the helm of government,
and are entrusted with the management of public affairs.  But
how is it possible, that the purposes of public instruction
should be properly attained, in the present situation of many
of our schoolmasters, with respect to salaries and appoint-
ments?  Is it in truth to be expected, that any person, who
has been at the expence of an education, sufficient to qualify
him for being a teacher and instructor of youth, should be-
take himself to that irksome and laborious profession, when
the emoluments are so poor, (in country parishes especially,
where the school wages are small, and there is no opportunity
of raising a large school), as to be inferior to the wages of a
day labourer, or a common servant?  The time will certainly
come, when the eyes of the nation will be opened to their
own best interests, as well as to those of their fellow creatures
and this useful body of men will be placed in circumstances,
more likely to ensure the great ends of education, and public
instruction, both to individuals, anti the community.

   Poor.-The number of persons receiving charity, at pre-
seat, is 6; and they are supplied by the session, as their situa-
tion and necessities seem to require.  The annual average
amount of contributions at the church door, is 4 L.; the
money received for the use of the mort-cloth, and fines for
irregular marriages, 3 L.; and there is a fund of about 80 L.
lent out at interest.
