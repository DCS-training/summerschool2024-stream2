   Heritors, etc.-There are 10 heritors in the parish, of
whom no one possesses more than 600 L. land rent; the low-
est about 6o L.; and, from this to the highest, running from
200 L. to 300 L. and 400 l.; so that, upon the whole, proper-
ty is more equally divided here than in most parishes.  All
the heritors, except one, reside in the parish, most of them
upon their own estates, to the improvement of which they
have been attentive, in clearing, subdividing, inclosing, and
planting them, and in setting an example of good husbandry
on the lands in their own possession.  In general, they are
well accommodated with houses, several of which are plea-
santly situated, especially those on the banks of the Forth.
