                     II.--CIVIL HISTORY.
   Parochial Registers.--These are three in number. 1st, A re-
gister of proclamations of marriage, which is complete from 1718
to the present time; 2d, a register of births and baptisms, which
was begun in 1706 and continued to 1714. There is a blank till
1718, after which it is complete to the present time. 3d, The mi-
nutes of the kirk-session from September 1691, when Mr John Pais-
ley was ordained, till June 1700. The minutes are wanting from
this date till August 1709, from which tbey extend to 1760, after
which there is another chasm till 1777. From 1777 they are
complete to the present day. In looking into the earlier period
of these records, one is struck with the quantity of business that
came before the session, when he considers the smallness of the
population, the primitive, and, as we are accustomed to think,
purer state of society. The strictness of discipline, however, and
the fact, that almost every offence came before the kirk-session,
may account for the number of cases on record, without denying
that "the former times were better than these."
   Historical Events.--The battle of Muirdykes, fought on a farm
of the same name in the eastern part of the parish, June 18, 1685,
is noticed by a number of historians, such as Wodrow, Sir Patrick
Hume of Polwart, and Dr McCrie in his Memoirs of Bryson.
The Duke of Argyle collected in Holland an army of 1500 refu-
gees from Scotland, with whom he landed at Kintyre and proceed-
ed towards Glasgow. When they reached Kilpatrick his follow-
ers began to desert him. With a few of them he crossed the
Clyde and came to Inchinnan, where he was taken prisoner, car-
ried to Edinburgh, and executed. A remnant of his followers,
under the command of Sir John Cochran, came to Muirdykes,
