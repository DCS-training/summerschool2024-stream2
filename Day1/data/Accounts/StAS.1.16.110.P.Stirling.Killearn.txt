the end of May.  The parr is, through the whole year, an
inhabitant of the Enrick; but it is in greatest perfection
about the beginning of harvest.  Some of them more than
a foot in length, have been caught at Gartness.

   Plants, Trees, etc.-Great varieties of indigenous plants
ornament the numerous glens, rocks, and muirs.  The Ju-
niper grows in some places to a great size, and is com-
monly very prolific.  The stone bridge over the Blane, at
the Moss, is founded upon a layer of juniper bushes.  It is
believed that this plant, when in a wet situation below
ground, resists corruption for a very long time.  It was be-
lieved, during the plague in Scotland, that people who
lived in the immediate neighbourhood of places abounding
with juniper, or who burned it plentifully in their houses,
were not readily, if at all affected with the plague.  The
Scottish Gaul, (Myrica Gale, Linn.), a valuable vermi-
fuge, abounds in several places of the parish.  Were the
qualities of this oderiferous shrub more generally known,
its cultivation would probably be attended with consider-
able profit.  Amongst the plants which are not generally
very common, are the Festuca ovina vivipara; Echium
vulgare, Imperatoria Ostruthium, Parnassia palustris, Poly-
gonum Pensylvanicum, Adoxa Moschatellina, Eryfimuin
Barbarea, Chrysosplenium Alternifolium, Saxifraga hyp-
noides, Matricaria Parthenium, Empetrum nigrum, Asple-
nium Scolopendrium, A. Ruta muraria, Polypodium Lon-
chitis, P. phegopteris, P. fragile, Lycopodium clavatum,
L. Selaginoides, L. Selago, L. Alpinum.
   The Sambucus nigra (elder tree, Eng.) is no stranger
in many places of the parish.  Some of the trees are very
well shaped, and by the natural bending of the branches
cause an agreeable shade, or bower, exhibiting an example
of the propriety of the name given to that species of plants
