     Statistical Account

   The Name and General Appearance.-The name was former-
ly Dingnaval or Dingnavallis, and took its origin from the
richness and fertiliry of the soil of the lower grounds, which
form a considerable part of the parish.  Excluding a small
district, peopled by few inhabitants, and divided from the
rest by a high hill, this parish forms nearly an oblong of one
and a half by two miles.  It consist partly of a pretty exten-
sive valley, and partly of the sloping sides of hills, a great
portion of which is in a high state of cultivation.  The waste
ground is not very considerable, and there are no commons
in the parish; the great bulk of the land is in culture; and 
the whole forms a beautiful interchange of hill and valley,
wood and water, corn-fields and meadows.

   Soil.-The soil over the whole parish is abundantly fertile,
and the greater part is uncommonly rich.  It generally con-
sists of a deep loam, or clay mixed with a considerable quan-
tity of vegetable mould, which, in seasons of any tolerable
mildness, and with an ordinary degree of good culture, sel-
dom, if ever, sails to produce luxuriant crops.  Every kind
of pulse, and all the culmiserous grains are accordingly found
to thrive well in this parish.  But from the slatness of the
ground in the lower parts, and the steepness of the neigh-
bouring hills, together with the nature of the foil, a wet sea-
son is always uncommonly pernicious to its produce.  It re-
tards the labour of the farmer both in spring and in autumn,
to a degree not experienced in other places, which are neither
more favourably situated with respect to climate, nor nearly
equal in point of fertility of soil.

   Climate.-The climate of this part of the country is upon
the whole tolerably good.  It is not subject to any distructive
inundations, nor has it more frequent rains than most other
