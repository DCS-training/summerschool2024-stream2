of the present century, have been considerably altered; for
during the commotions of 1689, the greatest part of the
houses were burnt by an irritated and licentious soldiery,
and such of them as had stood to the west and north-west of
the cathedral were not rebuilt.  The ground which they,
and the gardens which had lain intermixed with them, oc-
cupied, is supposed to have extended to about five acres,
and this space now forms a part of the Duke of Atholl's
lawn and policy.  But as the boundaries of the town reced-
ed on one quarter, they streteched out on another.  Several
new houses were built on the slope of the eminence which
rises to the eastward of the town.  These are uniformly de-
scribed in the title-deeds as lying in the parish of Caputh.
That parish indeed completely surrounds Dunkeld, (except
where it is skirted on the south by the Tay), and in for-
mer times had reached, it thus appears, close to the site of
the buildings.  Stipend is paid to the minister of Caputh
from a piece of ground lying but a few yards from the ca-
thedral.

     POPULATION.

   The numbers returned to Dr Webster, in 1755, were
1298.  By an accurate list taken in 1789, (and there is no
reason to believe that they have either increased or dimi-
nished materially since that time), they amounted to 1086
souls.  Of these 589 were males, and 497 were females.
Though no regular and authentic list of the births and bu-
rials has been kept, yet by evidence on which great reliance
may be placed, the number of the former is calculated to
be, on an average, 36 annually, and of the latter, 27.  Of
marriages, the average annual number is 9.  The propor-
tion of births thus annually, to the total number of inha-
bitants, is as 1 to 30; of deaths, as 1 to 40; and of marri-
ages, as 1 to 120.  The proportion of births to marriages
