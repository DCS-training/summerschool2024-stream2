     Statistical Account

   Situation, Extent, etc.-These united parishes are situated
in that district of Argyllshire called Mid Lorn.  Kilmore is
the seat of the presbytery.  They are 7 miles long, and 6
broad, and in their form nearly circular.  The number of
acres cannot be ascertained.  An island is annexed, facing
Oban, named Kerera, which is 3 miles in length.  It is the
property of Mr. McDougal of that ilk, excepting one farm,
which belongs to Lord Breadalbane.

   Surface and Soils.-The country is hilly, but not moun-
tainous.  The hills, though low, are covered with heath, ex-
cepting a few that are cropped by the sheep, which are in-
creasing in the parish.  The vallies are generally arable.  The
soil is different in different farms; but for the most part shal-
low and spouty.  In many places it is mossy, in some clayish
and in others sandy, mixed with gravel.  This parish, like
most others in this county, is more calculated to produce grass
than corn; get it yields as large a proportion of the latter as
any of the adjacent parishes; and from the increasing know-
ledge of agriculture in this part of the country, more and
more of the arable lands are annually brought into cultiva
tion.

   Climate and Diseases, etc.-Though the rainy season, in this
part of the country, continues nearly two thirds of the year,
yet the health of the inhabitants does not suffer, so much
as might be imagined; but the grain is much injured by it.
Westerly winds prevail to a great degree; but severe frosts,
or great falls of snow, seldom occur.-This parish is liable to
no particular maladies.  Fevers and fluxes are not more
common than in the lower parts of the kingdom.  Golds and
rheumatisms are a little more prevalent, owing perhaps to the
humidity of the air.  Instances of longevity sometimes occur-
