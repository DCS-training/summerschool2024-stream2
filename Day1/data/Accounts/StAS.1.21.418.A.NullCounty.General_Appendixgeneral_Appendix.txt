may not be improper to mention a beautiful cascade, called
the Reeky-Lin, about two miles west from Airly Castle,
where the Isla falls, with impetuosity and noise, from a rock
apparently sixty feet high, into a whirl-pool; the appearance
of which, especially when the water is in flood, is so grand,
that many lovers of natural curiosities have come from a con-
siderable distance to behold it.  A little farther down is
what is called the Slug of Achranny, where the banks on
each side are remarkably high and steep, and the water con-
fined between two rocks very near each other, tumbles
down a precipice, exhibiting a tremendous appearance.  The

of the parish and joins the Isla at the Castle of Airly.  A-
bout two miles up from this junction, it tumbles over four
rocky precipices from fifteen to thirty feet high, called the
Loups of Kenny, the banks on each side being uncommonly
steep.  In high water especially, the spectator is entertained
with an appearance peculiarly grand and majestic.  About
half a mile farther down, the river moves for a short way
( till it falls into the isla ) in a most pleasant serpentine den
covered on each side with natural wood, which delights the
eye of every person who can relish the beauties of nature.
And this leads me to observe, that as this parish in general is
fertile and improveable, and washed with the two above
mentioned rivers, it wants only wood to make it one of the
most pleasant and beautiful places in this or any other
northern county.  Some clumps, however, of ashes of con-
siderable size appear about most of the farm steadings, which
afford some shelter and embellishment.  One farm particu-
larly, called Kinnaird, scarcely half a mile eastward from the
