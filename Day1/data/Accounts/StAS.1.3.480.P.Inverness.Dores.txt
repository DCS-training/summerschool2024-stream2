very small proportion.  The soil, in some of these, has
greatly the advantage over that of the low ground, and is
very productive in seasons free from frost, or much rain.
The parish, in general, though better calculated for pastu-
rage than for raising corn, produces as much grain as is suffi-
cient for the subsistence of its inhabitants.  The air is esteem-
ed salubrious, and may live to a good age, though there are
no instance of great longevity.  There are, however, in the
neighbourhood, 3 men and their wives, whose ages, added
together, amount to 510 years.

   Cultivation and Produce.-The crops chiefly produced here
are oats, barley, and potatoes, on the latter of which the
poorer sort chiefly depend for subsistence.  The new mode
of farming can hardly be said to be introduced into this pa-

the middle of April.  The sowing of barley begins about the
12th May, and continues to the end of that month.  The
reaping of the crop, unless the season is wet and cold, as
happened last year, is from the beginning of September to
the middle of October.

   Wages.-Male servants receive from 3 l. to 5 l.  Sterling

few day labourers, (as many of the young lads go out of the
county for work, in the summer and harvest), which obliges
the tenants to keep more domestic servants, especially in har-
vest, than their farms can well afford to support.  On this
account, more than from unskilfulness in husbandry, some
