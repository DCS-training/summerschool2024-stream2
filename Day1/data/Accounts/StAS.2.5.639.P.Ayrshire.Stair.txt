				STAIR.                       639


	The strata of copper and antimony, mentioned in the former
Account, found on the same property (also near to the whetstone),
have not yet been wrought.
	The writer of the former Account mentions that he thought it
very probable that limestone would be found in the parish; but
unFortunately, an object so interesting to the agriculturist has not
yet been realized. It occurs about two feet in thickness in the
coal shaft on the estate of Drongan, but lies too deep, and is so
situated as to be nearly, or rather altogether, unavailable for
agricultural purposes.
	Coal abounds in the parish. The colliery mentioned in the
former Account, as having been wrought on the estate of Drongan,
for above a century, is still in full operation.
	On the lands of Drumdow, about the centre of the parish, there
is also understood to be a very considerable deposit of coal, which,
after being wrought for about 15 years, has been discontinued
within these few months, and it is not yet arranged among the
parties whether it shall be resumed.
