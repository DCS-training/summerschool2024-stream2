           raw produce annually raised in the parish, as nearly as can be as-
           certained, may be stated under the following heads:
           Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for food of man, or the
                        domestic animals,                                                    f 45,600
                        potatoes and turnips cultivated in the fields,                           6500
                        hay almost all cultivated,                                               9300
                        garoens and orchards,                                                   12600
                        fisherhes in the Tay,                                                     560
                        annual -thinning of plantations and occasional felling of wood,            50
                        a sandstone quarry,                                                       200
                        reeds,                                                                    470

                               Total yearly value of raw produce raid                          f63,940
               The valued rent of the parish is L. 16,982, 3s. 4d.  Scots.  The
           real rent in the year 1829 was L. 26,0,00 Sterling, including rents
           of houses and feus; but, at the present time, it scarcely amounts
           to L- 24,000.
              Manufaciures.-The principal branch of manufacture carried
           on in the parish, is that of different kinds of linen cloth.  The

           only other one, indeed, is the manufacture of a species of soft
           coarse canvas, made from a sort of secondary hemp, and intend-
           ed for bags or coverings in the package of goods.  In these manu-
           factures, there are upwards of 300 persons employed as veavers,
           exclusive of those who are employed in spinninc, and winding.  Of
           these 300, more than one-third are women.
              Living in a country village, or in rural situations throughout the
           parish, the operatives do not seem to suffer any injury to their
           health, from their employment.  Nor is there any evidence that
           they have been injured in their morals.
              Navigation.-Besides the daily passageboat between Port-Allen
           and Newburgh, which is fitted also for the transmission of lime,
           timber, iron, farm-produce and other commodities, there is but
           one vessel which belongs to the port now mentioned, the only one
           in this parish.  That vessel is chiefly employed in the importation
           of lime and coals, and in the exportation of grain and potatoes.
           Various other vessels, however,'are occasionally employed in carry-
           ing on the trade of this port.  The quantity of lime annually im-
           ported into thd parish, though not-all at Port-Allen, is not less
           than 5000 bolls.  The boll consists, as already stated, of 52 stones
           Dutch.
              The quantity of coals annually imported at the same place, is
           about 700 tons of Scoteb, and 300 tons of English.
             The harbour dues are at the rate of Id. per ion on articles in
           general, and 1/2d. per boll of lime.  These dues were, till lately,
           levied by the proprietor, on whose property the harbour is situated;
