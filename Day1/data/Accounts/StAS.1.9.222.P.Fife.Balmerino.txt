of yairs or scaffolds with poke-nets, and in summer with
sweep and toot nets.  The first are hauled when the fish
strike the nets in their way up with the flowing tide.  The
second are payed off and drawn in at a certain time of the
tide, without knowing whether there are salmon or not;
and the last are set in the water, and never drawn till the
watchman, or tootsman, as he is called here, observes the
fish to have got within the net.  These fishings are become
very valuable of late, and bring in money to the country
from our neighbours in England.  There is likewise a spir-
ling fishing carried on here through the winter, and as
they catch great numbers of spirlings, garvies, herrings,
slounders, &c. they are sold at low prices, and are easily
come at by the poorest in the parish.  The spirlings are
taken with poke-nets tied between two poles, and anchor-
ed at the back end.  The ebbing tide forces the fish into
them, and they are shaken out at low water*.  The fish-
ers, who are extremely industrious, likewise catch seals, in
the summer months, with long nets, for which, besides the
value of the oil and skins, they draw a small premium
from the salmon-dealers in Perth.

   Antiquities.-The first thing that deserves our notice
here, is the ruins of the Abbey of Balmerino.  Some pil-
lars of excellent workmanship, and most durable stone, e-
very one ornamented in a different manner, and covered
in by a beautiful arch, are still to be seen.  There are also
some semicircular vaults, one of which seems to have been
a place of worship, as there is a row of stone-benches all
round it, and nigh the entrance two basons cut out in the
stone, probably for holding holy water, as the bust of the

*The reason why I do not mention the fishers in my description of the
people is, that they are all either tradesmen or labourers, and follow their
occupation when the fishing is over.
