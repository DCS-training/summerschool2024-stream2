of cheese and the wages of servants, are tripled, in this coun-
try, within these 40 years: partly owing to the improved
state of the country, and partly to the influx of money from
the East Indies.  This rise in the articles of living does not
affect the landed interest, because their rents rise in propor-
tion; neither does it materially affect labourers, manufacturers,
or farmers, because the prices of their labour, and of their
commodities, rise in the same degree; but to individuals, or to
classes of men who live upon stated annuities, such as the mini-
sters of the Established Church, these are serious matters.  The
same domestic expence, which they could easily have supported
about 40 years ago, upon an income of 50 L., cannot, at this
day, be supported upon thrice that income.  They must there-

remedy, unless the Court of Teinds are pleased to adopt an-
other mode of procedure, by opening decreets, at shorter inter-
vals, or the Legislature to interfere, to rescue them from pe-
nury, which always begets contempt.

farmers in any part of this parish.  There are no manufac-
tures upon extensive plans, or carried on by companies, upon
a joint stock.  Woollen and linen yarn is much spun by the
poor, for sale.  The carpet manufacturers in Stirling buy up
the woollen, and the Glasgow manufacturers the linen yarn.
The servants, and the children of farmers are all employed,
(when they have no labour in the fields), in spinning these
kinds of yarn, partly for sale, and partly for their own use.
All that is wanted, to establish manufactures here, is a proper
plan, and some person or company of credit to be undertakers.
Wool has become the staple of this country of late years.  We
have also fine streams to drive machinery, of any weight
necessary in the linen or cotton business, and plenty of proper
