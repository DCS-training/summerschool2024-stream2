it of little use. The river Leven, the only one in the county, no-
ticed by Buchanan, issues from the loch of the same name, and,
after flowing through a fertile vale and receiving many tributaries,
discharges itself into Largo bay, at the town of Leven. It abounds
with various kinds of trout, pike, and eels, and at its estuary there
was formerly a valuable salmon-fishing; but, owing to the forma-
tion of some of the dam-dikes, which prevent the salmon from
ascending the river, and also to the deleterious substances from
the bleachfields, which are mixed with its waters, this fishing has
been discontinued for several years.
  Geology and Mineralogy.--Beds of coal, varying in thickness,
and at different depths under the surface, pervade the whole of the
parish; but none of the seams are at present worked. The coal upon
the estate of Durie, which was wrought for upwards of a century, and
was drained by a water engine, consisted of three seams, the two up-
per, each four feet thick, and the lower eight feet. There is under-
stood to be a fourth seam below these, called the craw coal, the crop-
ping of which comes out about 120 yards south-east of the mansion-
house. The third seam, called the main coal, was considered the best
in the county. Considerable quantities of it used to be exported
to Holland, where it met with a ready sale; and it is said, even at
this day, that the best Scotch coals in that market go under the
name of Durie coals. The direction of the strata is from the N. W.
to the S. E.; with one hitch or dike below the farm house of Ban-
beatb, and another about a mile farther east. The following old
table shows a section of Durie coal and metals, cut by a plane
perpendicular to the streak, from the crop to the depth of forty
fathoms.
