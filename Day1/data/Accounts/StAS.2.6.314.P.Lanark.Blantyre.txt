			PARISH OF BLANTYRE.

	PRESBYTERY OF HAMILTON, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR.

		THE REV. JAMES ANDERSON, MINISTER.*

	           I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--THE name of this parish is probably derived from the,
Gaelic, Bla'-an-tir, a warm retreat,--which is perfectly descriptive
of the site of the village of Blantyre, and more or less of the whole
district.
	Extent, Boundaries.--The parish of Blantyre is a long stripe of
rather low-lying land, stretching nearly in a direct line from north
to south. From Haugh-head on the Clyde, near Daldowie in the
north, to the burn between Crottangram and East Crutherland in
the south, it is exactly 6 miles and 2 furlongs in length. The
breadth is very variable: the narrowest part at Blantyre Craig,
near the Priory, is about 3 furlongs; the widest part between Both-
well Bridge on the east, and Greenhall on the west, 2 1/2 miles; the
average breadth is about 1 mile. It is bounded by the parish of
Glasford on the south; Hamilton and Bothwell on the east; Old
Monkland on the north; and Cambuslang and Kilbride on the
west. It contains 6.50 square miles, 3307 Scots acres, and 4170.732
imperial acres. It is commonly divided into 24 ploughgates, of
from 80 to 100 acres each.
	Climate.--The climate is nearly the same as in the neighbouring
parishes; and the average quantity of rain falling has been well as-
certained both by rain-gages kept in this parish, and in other
places immediately on its border. From a rain-gage kept by
R. D. Alston, Esq. of Auchinraith, we have the following results:
From April 1, 1833, to March 31, 1834, 35 4/10 inches; from
March 31, 1834, to April 1, 1835, 26 4/10 , inches. During the
months of April, May, June, and July of this year, we have 6 7/10 in-
ches. As compared with a rain-gage kept at Castle Toward, the
rain falling filere is nearly one-half less.
