'after pointing out a few experiments upon the fiddle, exhi-
'bits a simple and even obvious solution of all the supposed
'inconsistencies; makes large discoveries in what may be
'called the elements of tune, and properties belonging to
'the scale of music, which have hitherto lurked in conceal-
'ment.  It banishes temperament, which, like a mist, ob-
'scures the intense beauties of harmony.  It shews that the
'system, which has hitherto been understood to be incon-
'sistent in its parts, and limited to twelve signatures, or
'twenty-four keys major and minor, is truely and perfectly
'consistent in all its parts, and likewise infinite in its pro-
'gression.  It exhibits a simple system of three signatures
'only, in naturals, in shurps and flats; which, instead of
'tempered, that is, imperfect intervals, is capable of supply-
'ing musical composition with true tune in every point, both
'for melodies and their accompanying harmonies; and ap-
'plies the whole practically to instruments of the violin spe-
'cies; showing how to find the true intonation of every
'note in every key major and minor of the received system:
'and likewise to keyed instruments, by shewing the degrees
'of tune requisite, and the manner of tuning them, where-
'by other instruments may likewise be reformed.  In short,
'it vindicates the laws of nature from the imputation of in-
'consistencies, hitherto deemed insurmountable; and leaves
'us to wonder where the difficulty lay, which has hitherto
'baffled the learned in all ages.'

Solway Frith' is a note in the MSS. after Sarkfoot: not Long-

the MSS.) are left out; and as the facts they contain were
required to be stated, and as Mr Martin observes that they
are inserted in other accounts, both prior and posterior to the
