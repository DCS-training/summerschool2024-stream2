which procuring peats, especially in rainy seasons, occasions, 
they earnestly join in the general complaint of this part of 
Scotland, against the partial and absurb duty which is laid up-
on coals imported into this part of the kingdom.  To cast, dry, and 
cart home all the peats consumed in the parish, would occupy 
for one day 4762 persons, together with 1382 horses and 
carts, whose labour ought to be rated at L. 376.  A few 
coals also are used by those that are at a distance from the 
moss.-Another great, though precarious advantage, is,
that the farmers of this parish, in general, hold their farms
of a landlord, whose wise and good maxims, in the ma-
nagement of this estate, have hitherto been, not to over-
rate his land, nor to remove his old tenants, so long as they
are disposed to keep their farms, whilst they continue to be in-
dustrious, and while there is even a probability that they
shall be able to pay their rent.  The leafes on the Niths-
dale estate are always offered again to the old tenant, and
renewed at least two years before their expiration: a practice
well worthy the regard of all those landholders, who do not
mean, by encouraging a competition of bidders, to stir up en-
vy, and to raise their land above its just value.
   The farmers of this parish, and indeed, generally speak-
ing, almost all its inhabitants, are natives of it.  Excepting
two Irish families, also, they are all of Scotch extraction.  Here
the fathers, for some generations back, have possessed the
same farms which their children now cultivate.  The te-
nants value themselves as much on this antiquity of posses-
sion, as if they were hereditary proprietors, and not with-
out reason, as it still has been a claim to the landlord's favour;
and we trust, that we shall not be accused of carrying our
speculations too far, when we venture to assert, that the per-
petuity of possession which the farmers enjoy, is not only
