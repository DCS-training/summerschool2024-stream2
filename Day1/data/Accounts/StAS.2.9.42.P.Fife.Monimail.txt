   Language.-The language spoken is the dialect peculiar to
Fifeshire, which contains a good many words not to be found in
Johnson, though their number is gradually diminishing. The pro-
nunciation is slow and rather drawling. The double oo, as in fool,
is sounded as the French u in un. The l after p and b is often
changed into a short i or y, plough and blue being pronounced piu
and biu, a corruption similar to the change of the Latin planus into
the Italian piano. - The a in haste, hate, &c. has a sound interme-
diate between the ay in may, and the e in me, which is in fact a dis-
tinct vowel, peculiar to the "kingdom of Fife." The short i, as in
him, is pronounced nearly as the u in tub.
