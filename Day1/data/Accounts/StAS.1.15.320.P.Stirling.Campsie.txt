more than 100 feet, above 20 feet per mile.  Besides the
Glazert, there are no less than 19 small burns which fall into
it.  Perhaps to people who have been accustomed to reside
chiefly in a level country, few scenes will appear, more truly
picturesque than that of the streams of water rushing down
the sides of the Campsie Fells in a flood, while the top of the
mountain is perfectly hid in the blue mist.  This stream of
water, though highly picturesque, and exceeding useful, is still
accompanied with some inconveniences.  In the 1st place,
when there is a great drought, the spring water is apt to be
impregnated too much with mineral water coming from the
coal-levels, which must prove highly prejudicial to the bleach-
er.  In the 2d place, The least shower brings down such a quan-
tity of moss from the hills, as to prove very troublesome in the
finer operations of preparing the cloth: the manufacturers,
however, have contrived in a great measure to remedy both
defects, by filtrating the water through the fine beds of gra-
vel, upon which their works are situated; there is one acci-
dent which happens, against the bad effects of which there
is no guarding, but by turning off the water altogether from
the works; and that is, when the stagnating water in some
old coal-waste breaks out, it will tinge every stone in the ri-
ver, for miles, and kill every fish which comes within its
poisonous influence.  We have seen the trouts, after such an
irruption, floating on the surface, gathered in baskets full, and
eaten by the country people, yet no bad effect following from
eating such poisoned fish*.  This district originally must
have been much better wooded than at present, as is evident

*The Glazert, in former times, was a great deposit for salmon spawn,
whereby an uncommon quantity of fry was yearly produced, for recruiting
the fisheries on the Clyde, the number of its sords and sand banks being well
calculated for such a nursery.  It is said that the raising of the Damhead at
