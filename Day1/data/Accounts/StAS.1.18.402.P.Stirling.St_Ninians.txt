     Statistical Account

   Mr James Mackie, was admitted March 1734.  This settle-
ment was promoted by the Heritors, in opposition to a great
proportion of the inhabitants of the parish.  During this in-
cumbency, about one half, it is reported, of the inhabitants of
the parish, left the Established Church, and joined the Seces-
sion.
   Mr John Gibson with consent of all parties, was admitted
May 1754, and till his translation to Edinburgh, 1765, the
parish continued almost in the same state in which he found
it.
   The next settlement was opposed by almost the whole pa-
rish.  In June, however, 1773, the eighth year of a process

David Thomson was admitted minister.  The Establishment
was then abandoned by the great body of its adherents.  These,
with a few others from neighbouring parishes, joined them-
selves to the Communion of the Presbytery of Relief.  A
large house was erected; a minister called and ordained;
and a stipend was fixed at L. 100 per annum.  This stipend is
principally raised from the produce of the seat-rents.
   Previous to Mr Thomson's death in 1787, his hearers were
indulged with the choice of the assistant preacher.  From this
period, the adherents of the Establishment were gradually
augmented.  In the year 1788, they resolved from voluntary
contributions, to purchase the right of Patronage; though
the price amounted to a sum, between L. 600 and L. 700 ster.
the resolution was soon carried into effect, and a young man,
who was appointed to preach in the church during the vacan-
cy occasioned by Mr Thomson's death, was admitted mini-
ster in October 1788.
