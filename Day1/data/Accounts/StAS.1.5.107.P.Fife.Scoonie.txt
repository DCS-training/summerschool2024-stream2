     of Scoonie.

the parish is inclosed with ditch and hedge:  There are no
hills, but several swells or risings of the ground, which,
with belts and clumps of planting, afford a finely variegated
prospect.

   Soil, Climate.-There are not 10 acres of unarable ground
in the whole district, but the soil is of different kinds:  The
southern and lower part of the parish, comprehending about
two thirds of it, consists partly of a dry sharp soil, yielding
good crops of all sorts of grain, and of excellent quality, ex-
cept in very dry weather; and partly of a rich heavy loam,
yielding large crops in all seasons.  The northern and higher
part of the parish is a moist black soil, of which a large pro-
portion is generally in pasture, for which it is well adapted;
and when broke up, after lying 8 or 10 years, yields two
or three very heavy crops.  The climate in the lower part
of the parish is, in general, very mild and temperate; but
the E. and S. E. winds, blowing from the sea, are, espe-
cially in the spring months, extremely sharp and penetra-
ting.  In the northern part of the parish, the climate is more
unkindly, and the harvest two or three weeks later, owing
to the greater moisture of the soil, and its more elevated
situation.  The inhabitants are, in general, healthy, and not
subject to any epidemical disease.  Inoculation has not yet
become so general as in some other parts of the country, but
the people's prejudices against it are gradually subsiding.

   Produce, Agriculture.-The crops in the lower part of
the parish are wheat, pease and beans, barley, oats, pota-
toes, turnips, cabbage, flax and grass.  Almost all the
ground, designed for pasture, is sown with artificial grass.  In
the higher part of the parish, the crops are, barley, oats, po-
tatoes, a small proportion of pease, some turnips and flax.
