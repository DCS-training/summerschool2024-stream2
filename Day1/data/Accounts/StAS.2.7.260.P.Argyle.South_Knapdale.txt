they remain but a very short time, disappointing the hopes of
the fishermen.  For some seasons, there had been a salmon-fish-
ery at Corie.  It was found not to pay, and has been given up.
The quality of the salmon was excellent.  Mussels are found in
great abundance, but are not of a good quality, and are used only
for bait.  Oysters are found in small quantities.  A few cockles,
limpets, and spout-fish, are also to be found about the shores of
the loch.
   Woods.-There is a considerable extent of ground under wood,
both natural and planted.  The plantations consist of larch,
Scotch spruce, and silver firs, ash, beech, plane, and willow of
many kinds.  The natural and indigenous trees are chiefly oak,
ash, birch, hazel, and holly, &c.  The natural wood is both orna-
mental and useful, useful for its timber and bark, and also be-
cause of the shelter it affords wintering cattle.
   There is a good deal of young plantation put down, which, in
process of time, will tend much to beautify the landscape, and in-
crease the value of property.  The oldest, largest, and finest trees
are to be seen at Achindarroch, Inverneill, and Barmore.  The
young plantations at Ormsary are very extensive, and (except on
the tops of the hills) very thriving.  When Mr Campbell com-
pletes his plan of continuing them to the shore on the south, and
laying down some clumps to the north of the house, Ormsary will
be one of the best sheltered and beautiful places of residence to
be met with.  There is an excellent garden and tasteful shrub-
bery near the mansion.  The old garden, now forming part of
the shrubbery, was, in the days of yore, from its productiveness,
called the orchard of Caoliside.
   Botany.-All the principal residences in the parish have their
gardens, their flower-plots, and shrubberies, in which may be seen
the ordinary flowers and plants, both indigenous and exotic.  The
rarest plants noticed in the parish are the following,  viz.
