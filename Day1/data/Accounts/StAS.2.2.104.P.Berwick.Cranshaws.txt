George Buchan Esq. of Kelloe, who very generously presented
to it L. 5. The number of volumes at present amounts to 200,
and a large addition is expected when our own heritors shall favour
us with their subscriptions.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-There are at present three persons
all aged and infirm, receiving parochial aid, and the sum given to
each is 1s. 6d. per week. The minister proposed to the heritors
of this parish several years ago, that the regular assessment for the
maintenance of the poor should,dispensed with, and something
in the name of donation substituted when the kirk-session should
require it. This proposal was thankfully accepted by the heritors,
and is still acted upon. For several years the contribution of the
heritors in this way has amounted to L. 12 per annum. The ave-
rage amount of church collections is L. 6 a-year.
   Fuel.-The fuel in general use is peat and turf, which may cost
about 1s. 6d. per cart, when ready for using, and 1s. more when
brought home.

                MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   To improve this parish, a good road is indispensable from three
miles to the east of the manse to the head of Whitadder. There
is a very level line for the purpose. The materials are at hand
throughout that distance, and some miles would,saved to the
traveller. Plantations also are much wanted.
