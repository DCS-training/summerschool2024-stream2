	the farmers of Glenrinnes a more direct communication to a mar-
	ket for their grain.  The present substitute for a road is a rough
	cart track, running, through the district of Edinvillie and Glack-
	harnis, almost impassable, especially after the severe winter floods;
	but such is the necessity of having a road on this line, that much
	expense has been already laid out upon it, by temporary repairs
	yearly, partly by allocation of small sums from the road funds, and
	partly by private subscription.
	   It is in contemplation, however, to make a road near the pre-
	sent track, to communicate with the Aberlour toll-road, a little
	to the west of the manse at one of its extremities, and to join, at its
	other extremity, the road that has lately been made in Glenrin-
	nes; as also another branch to run from Edinvillie towards the
	Carron district, with the view of accommodating the western parts
	of the parish.  This road is anticipated with pleasure as a very
	great improvement.
	   The farmers of this parish are spirited according to their means,
	and some have employed a large capital to good account.
	   The system of husbandry adopted is much the same as that
	pursued in other agricultural districts.  Some years ago, the High-
	land Society gave premiums for the curing of butter, to a district
	embracing this and five other neighbouring parishes, and the first
	and second of four prizes were adjudged to Aberlour.  The patriotic
	and praiseworthy exertions of this national society, in the distri-
	bution of prizes for improvements in husbandry, certainly appear
	to be attended with those beneficial effects at which they aim: and
	it is to be hoped, that another competition, lately announced for
	this quarter, will be met by the good people with that emulation
	which the society has already in a great measure, inspired.
