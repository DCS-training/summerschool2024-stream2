The effects of the year 1782 are evident from the above
statement.  The parish funds bore the whole of the burden;
and, considering the high price of oat-meal, (1 s. 6 d. per
peck), the additional and unavoidable expence of these years
seems extremely moderate.  All the inconveniencies of that
memorable year seem now to be over; and, notwithstanding
the increased population of the parish, there is reason to be-
lieve, the expenditure to the poor will be considerably lower
than for many years previous to 1782.  This hope is found-
ed on the good effects (already felt) of the different charitable
institutions belonging to the respective trades of the parish
and neighbourhood.  There are four of these societies, or
boxes, as they are called, in the parish, and a great number of
people connected with others at a distance.  It is a fact
worth mentioning, that although, by the fatal fever of the
current year 1792, upwards of 30 fatherless children, and a
proportionable number of poor widows, are in great measure
left destitute, not a single application from that quarter has
as yet been made for public charity+.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The increased expence for the current year, 1792, is owing
to a greater number of occasional poor in distress, the stated
pension lift being considerably lower than that of last year.
