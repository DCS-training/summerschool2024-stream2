than they were in former times.  This may be partly attribu-
ted to the greater expence of living, and the advance of the rents;
as labour and industry are among the best preventatives of vice.

been, in the memory of man, a single instance of any person

   Horses, Sheep, and Black Cattle.-Through most of the
year, there are not above 120 horses in the whole parish.
The farmers begin to plow about the beginning of March;
and a great many of them join, two and two, to make out a
plough; which, in the language of the country, is called mar-
vowing.  Those who have much plowing to execute, buy
what horses they want, at the beginning of the working season,
and fell them again when the labour is over.  The number if
milch-cows is about 756.  But besides the horses sit for labour,
and the cows that give milk, there are many young horses and
cows reared, especially in the moorish part of it.  There are
upwards of 4000 old sheep in the parish, besides a proportion-
able number of young ones.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-Between Eaglesham and
Glasgow (about 9 miles distance) there is turnpike road, by
which the farmers carry what they have to sell, in carts or
waggons.  A turnpike road from Ayr to Edinburgh passes
through this village, by Hamilton, which is shorter by six miles
than by Glasgow, and will be finished this year.  A turnpike is al-
so proposed to be made from Muirkirk, through this village, to
Glasgow.  It may likewife be considered as an advantage
which the villagers enjoy, that they have their houses for nine
hundred years, at no higher an annual than 3d sterling a fall;
and each house has a rood of ground for a garden.  They have
