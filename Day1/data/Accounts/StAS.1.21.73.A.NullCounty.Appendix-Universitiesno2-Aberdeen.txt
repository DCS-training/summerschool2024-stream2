For himself, and his successors in that office.  As no clause
had been inserted in the deed, reserving the use for his life-
time, he was now obliged to leave his own house to a suc-
cessor!

   Singular Visitation of five Colonels, deputed by General Monk.-
A singular sort of visitation took place in 1651.  General
Monk sent five Colonels to visit and reform the colleges, viz.
Desborough, Fenwick, Moseley, Owen and Smith.  They
removed from their offices Principal Guild, with several of
the professors; not for want of learning or diligence, in
both which respects they are highly approved, but for some
want of exact conformity to the standard of theological opi-
nion at that time adopted by the army.  Principal Row, and
the other members who succeeded, are commended as learn-
ed and prudent men.  In other respects, however, these mi-
litary visitors treated the college not unkindly.  The large
building erected at this time, on the north-east corner of the
court, for the accommodation of the students, is said to have
been greatly forwarded by a contribution from General
Monk's officers.

   Restoration.-On the restoration of monarchy, in 1660, the
bishops of Aberdeen resumed all their original authority, as
chancellors of the University; and many things, that had
fallen into disorder during the preceding troubles, were now
regulated in conformity to Bishop Elphinston's foundation,
as revived in 1619.

   Bishop Scougal.-Under the mild and intelligent superin-
tendance of Bishop Scougal, the state of the University seems
to have been uncommonly prosperous, and the offices were
all filled with men well qualified for their stations.
