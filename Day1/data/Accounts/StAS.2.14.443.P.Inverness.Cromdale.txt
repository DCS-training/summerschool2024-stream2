meal for distribution amongst the mbst necessitous. There seems
no indisposition on the part of the poor to accept of parochial
aid.
   The only prison in the parish is that of Grantown. There are
six inns or public houses. Four markets are held in Grantown
during the year, besides a number of cattle trysts. The fuel
chiefly used is peat.

          MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
With respect to the more striking variations between the pre-
sent state of the parish, and that which existed at the time of the
former Account, I may generally refer to what has been already
stated under the different heads of inquiry. Almost all the farms
and buildings present instances of the greatest improvement. This
is, doubtless, in a great measure, to be attributed to the liberality
of the landlord, who gives every encouragement and considerable
compensation to the tenants for improving waste land, building
houses and farm-steadings. Much credit is also due to the
Strathspey Farmer's Club, consisting of the gentlemen of the dis-
trict, for the improved mode of husbandry.
   In regard to moral changes, there is not much to remark. It
may be proper, however, to mention, that a very decided improve-
ment has taken place in the mode of conducting funerals ; and
penny-weddings, which were very common in the parisha few-
years ago, are entirely suppressed.
