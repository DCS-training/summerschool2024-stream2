sent, and that their numbers have been gradually decreasing.
The number of poor now on the roll, does not exceed 10 or
12; for whole relief the weekly collections amounting to
L. 9,-the rent of a small farm purchased with a mortification,
L. 12,-and the interest of some late mortifications (L. 150, at
4 per cent.) L. 6,-total L. 27 a year, are quite sufficient.  Not
a single pauper, in this parish, has left his house to beg, these
30 years; but vagrants and beggars from other parishes are of-
then met with.

   School.-There is a parochial school, at which the number
of scholars, has, for many years past, been, at an average,
50 at least, the salary is L. 15, with a comfortable dwelling-
L. 21 more.  Besides this, there are two little schools with tris-
sling salaries, one at each extremity of the parish.

   Population.-The population, on the whole, is rather on
the increase.  From 1730, to 1760, the yearly average of
baptisms, entered in the register, is 15; from 1760, to 1770,
16; and, from 1770, to 1790, 18.

   Though this and other circumstances, in particular, the great
difference between the births and deaths, the one being in
proportion to the other as 25 to 11), fully prove an increased
population; yet old people, when conversed with upon the sub-
ject, uniformly maintain a contrary idea, grounding their opi-
nion, on the union of many small farms into one, on the vestiges
of ploughed land, at present neglected, and the remnants of
houses and cottages, now in ruins.  To these observations,
however, the answer is easy.  The servants, labourers, and
cottagers required on a large farm, will equal the population
on several small ones.  Much more barren land has been made
