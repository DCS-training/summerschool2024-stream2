the benefit of using and refining rock salt, which may be
exported to foreign countries, and to Ireland.  The 9th of
Queen Anne. c. 23. ^ 44. enacts, That for 32 years, every
ton of rock salt, put on board any ship in Great Britain,
and exported to Ireland, shall pay 9 s.  This duty is made
perpetual by 3 d. Geo. I. c. 7. but is not exacted.  No man
of enlarged views will grudge the Irish this advantage.
Let them enjoy it, only let us enjoy it along with them.
   Rock salt refined, and made into white salt, is eight
times as strong as that made in the frith of Forth; and at
Liverpool the former is sold, the best at 8 d. and small at
5 d. per bushel, exclusive of duties; while that made in
the frith of Forth is sold at 1 s. 3 d.  Here is a temptation
to smuggling, which cannot be resisted; and this ruinous
contraband trade flourishes in the west of England and
Scotland.
   Were the duty on salt taken off, and Scotland put upon
the same footing with Ireland, the great waste of beef and
tallow proceeding from driving our cattle to the English
markets, would be prevented.  This waste is greater than
is commonly thought of, in so much, that the eighth part
of every bullock is supposed to be lost in his journey; and
to this may be added, a tenth part of his value expended
upon him, for driving and food on his way*.  Much bet-
ter would it be for the country were he slaughtered at
home; but this cannot be done in the present state of the
salt laws.  These laws do not only keep away from us
much good, but they expose us every year to great evil.
Almost all our salt being smuggled, there is a dependence
upon a precarious supply at the time of laying in our win-
ter's provision; and I have known poor people in danger

*Accidents added, make this tenth an eighth, so that one fourth is
really lost.
