than any other rock in this country, the Egyptian granite or
syenite.  It admits of being finely polished, and is now extensively
used for that purpose by Mr Alexander Macdonald of Aberdeen,
who has erected a steam engine for polishing granite, and has pro-
duced very fine specimens of his work, in chimney-pieces, pillars,
pedestals, vases, &c.  As granite can be polished at less expense
and in a more perfect manner, by steam than by manual labour, it
is likely to come into general use.  The granite of Peterhead is
not inferior to that of Stirlinghill, while it is clearer in colour.
At Salthousehead is a quarry of beautiful gray or white granite of
excellent quality, but the rock is covered with a thick mass of clay.
The quarries on the Blackhill are extensive, and afford blocks of
large size; the colour is somewhat different from that of the Stir-
linghill or Peterhead rock, but it is equally durable and more
easily wrought in the quarry, being generally of large sizes
with open joints, and admitting of being easily squared by the
hammer.  The granite of Blackhill, in one quarry, is similar to
that of Salthousehead.
   The following is an account of the granite shipped at Peterhead,
from February 1817 to January 1822:-

   From the inexhaustible resources arising from these quarries,
the excellent and durable quality of the rock, and their proximity
to the harbours of Peterhead and Boddam, there cAn be little
doubt, that in the execution of public works of importance, the
working of them will afford employment to many labourers, and
tend to the improvement of the neighbourhood.
