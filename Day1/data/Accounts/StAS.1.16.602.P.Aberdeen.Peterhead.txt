person has for some time been afflicted with it, I think the
case is very different, and cannot fee sufficient reasons for
recommending the water but with the utmost caution.
If the water, from the quantity of fixed air, is supposed to
have a power to dissolve calculous concretions, fixed air
may be given in any quantity, and is frequently recom-
mended, without any of the stimulating ingredients which
are found in Peterhead water; and if it is supposed to ope-
rate as a cleanser by its diuretic qualities, liquids may be
given that are less irritating.
   Perhaps I may express myself strongly; but the simple
idea of driving gravel or small calculi through the kidneys,
ureters, or urethra, with cold iron, has always affected me
with some degree of terror, especially when we must be
ignorant of the quantity of gravel to be discharged, or the
size, shape, and surface (whether smooth or rough) of the
calculi that are to pass through there passages.
   When a nephritic paroxysm happens without the use of
any medicine, and is probably an effort of nature from irri-

and great-grandfather died of that disorder; his father was cut for the
stone.  He himself has hitherto kept entirely free from this complaint.
From a sedentary life, and severe study, he has at present some complaints,
which probably are unconnected with gravel; but being apprehensive of
that disorder, he as thinking of trying the Peterhead water, because his
father thought he received benefit from it, who, after having tried it for
near 30 years, was cut for the stone.
