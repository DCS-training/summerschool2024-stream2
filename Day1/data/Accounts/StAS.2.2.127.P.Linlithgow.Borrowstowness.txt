nected with the stations of fungi: while some species are equally
constant to these as the higher tribes of plants, there are others
very uncertain in this respect, disappearing for a succession of sea-
sons together, seemingly without any relation to the more obvious
influence of moist weather.  The causes of this would appear to
be obscure as the plants themselves, but the fact probably points
to a field of investigation in some measure peculiar to them, al-
though, in regard to the more general views of botanical geogra-
phy, they may have less claim upon the attention.
   The following is a general list of a few more of the rarer plants:

   Ornithology.-The only bird at all rare is the fauvette (Sylvia
hortensis.)  It seems to be as common some seasons about Kin-
neil as the black-cap, and is probably generally so throughout
Scotland, although overlooked from its similarity to others.
                           II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Parochial Records.-The parochial records consist of, 1st, five
volumes of minutes of session, regularly kept from 1694, and af-
fording interesting information regarding the state of morality and
religion in the parish in former times; 2d, six volumes of registers
of births, baptisms, proclamations, and marriages; the oldest vo-
lumes are imperfect; the earliest entry is dated 1648; 3d, two
volumes recording deaths, the first from 1736 to 1783, the se-
cond from 1808 to the present time; 4th, several volumes relating
to the management of the poor's funds.
   Antiquities.-The Wall of Antoninus, commonly called Gra-
ham's Dyke, traversed this parish.  This celebrated rampart, in
its course between the Friths of Forth and Clyde, crossed the
river Avon, the western boundary of the parish, near Inneravon,
and proceeded in an easterly direction towards Carriden or Aber-
corn; and its tract is still visible at various places along the high
