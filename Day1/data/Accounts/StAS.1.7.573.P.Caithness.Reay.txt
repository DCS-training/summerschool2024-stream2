flows from west to east, from the Atlantic Ocean down the
Pentland Frith.

   Mountains, Caves, etc.-Of Binra, the only considerable
mountain in the parish, the steepest side is computed to be a
large mile from top to bottom.  There is abundance of lime-
stone, moorstone, and granite.  Four quarries of freestone
have been opened; one in the hill above Bighouse; another
in the hill above Sandside; and one upon each side of Sand-
side Bay.  Blocks of stone for millstones are found in diffe-
rent parts of the hills.  Marl has been found in Braabin and
Dunreay.  A slender vein of lead-ore was lately discovered
near Reay, but in circumstances that afforded no encourage-
ment to work it.  Iron-ore is found in different places
through the parish.  There is, in this parish, a cave, which,
when a stone is cast into it, emits a hollow, echoing sound,
of which the name given it by the country people (glungang)
is imitative.  In Binra, too, is a natural cave, into which
cattle retire for shelter from storms.  The entrance is form-
ed by two natural stone-pillars, inclining towards each other.
In the top is an aperture.  This cave was once the resort of
a gang of robbers.  The shore at Borrowston presents a num-
ber of small caves, and a strong natural arch, covered with
green turf, in a level with the adjacent ground, and leading
over a chasm, about 40 feet deep, into which the side flows.

   Quadrupeds and Fowls.-The quadrupeds are, black cattle,
sheep, goats, swine, dogs, cats, hares, rabbits, otters, foxes,
badgers, rats, mice, moles, weasels, and wild cats.  The rat
is not to be seen in Strathalladale, nor in any other part of
Sutherland.  The birds are, eagles, hawks, swans, ducks,
wild geese, sea pies, sea plovers, scale ducks, herns, cormo-
rants, marrots or auks, kings fishers, rain geese, muir fowls,
