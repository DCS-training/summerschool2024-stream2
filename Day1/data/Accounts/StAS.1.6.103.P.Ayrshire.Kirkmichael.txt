a sluice out of Loch-Doon, out of which it issues, the river
can be kept under perfect command, so as neither to exceed
nor prove deficient in respect of water.-The length of the
parish is 9 miles, and its breadth 4.

   Minerals, Fuel, and Woods.-Freestone is found in a few
places, but no regular quarry has been opened.  A great
quantity of moor-stones are scattered up and down the surface:
the grey granite chiefly prevails.  Limestone has been disco-
vered in several places, chiefly on the south, where there are
extensive and valuable quarries of that useful article.  No coal
has as yet been discovercd in the parish, though there is an
appearance of it.  The common fuel is coal, brought from 4
to 6 miles distance, and costing 3 s. per ton at the pit.  An
ordinary farmer will consume 12 ton in a year.  On 2 or 3
farms, peats are used in part.  One hill is supposed to con-
tain lead: some attempts were made to bring it to light, but
without success.  Shell-marle has been dug out in a few pla-
ces, but in no great quantities.  There are immense stores of
hard marle, of various degrees of richness; but, on account
of its being slow in its operation, and not admitting of dis-
tant carriage, it has been used only in the vicinity of the pit.
It would be a valuable treasure where lime is scarce.-ln the
parish are many natural woods, chiefly of oak, ash, birch,
and alder, of great value to the proprietors, and very conveni-
ent for the country.  They are cut once in 40 years, though,
if they were properly managed when young, more crops
might be taken.

   Produce, Inclosures, and Manure-Of late, great quantities
of good oats have been raised; some bear, a few pease, and
little or no wheat.  The culture of potatoes is well understood,
and great crops are produced.  Hitherto lint has appeared on-
