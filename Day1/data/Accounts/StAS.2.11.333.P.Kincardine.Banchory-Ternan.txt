lows and towards the base of the hills, while, at some intermidiate
places, birch is found readily to thrive. More attention is now
given than formerly to adapt, the trees to the locality in which
they are planted, and, owing to the decreasing value ot fir timber,
and the quantity in this district about to be brought into the mar-
ket at once, the proportion of hard-wood is greatly ou the increase.
More than 290,000 larches and 66,000 oaks have been planted
on the estate of Leys alone, within the last three years.
	Among the most remarkable trees are numerous yews, all of
natural growth, springing from the top of the rocks at Crathes.
Some of them are 5 1/2 fdet girth at the base. Among several gi-
gantic specimens Of the common holly, one occurs on the side of
the public road leading to Aberdeen, about a mile from the
church, which springs from the sides and crevices of a rock, and
has upwards of twenty stems proceeding apparently from the same
root. It is 20 feet high, and shades an area of more than 36 feet
square. It is supposed to be at least 200 years old. In the
grounds of Crathes castle, there is also a magnificent beech, which
was planted in 1706, and is 25 feet in girt about 60 feet high,
and contains 320 cubic feet of timber.
        Zoology.-Twenty-four species of quadrupeds, and III of birds,
are found either permanently or occasionally in this district. The
following lists, it is believed, are nearly complete.

      MAMMALIA.               Martes foina         Mus messorius?
    Plecotus auritus          Lutra vulgaris       Arvicola amphibius

    Sorex araneus             Felis catus          Lepus timidus
    Talpa Europea             Mus rattus                  variabilis

    Mustella putorius             musculus         Cervus elaphus

	The roe is more common here than in most other district of tbe
country, but the red-deer is only occasionally seen in tho woods.
The Cervus dama, or fallow-deer, is now found wild in the neigh-
bourbood of Blackhall; but it is understood ta have been intro-
duced by a late proprietor. Rabbits are said to have been almost
unknown till a few from a distance were placed on the islands
of the Dee, about thirty years ago. They passed over the ice
in winter, and have now become everywhere so numerous as to
render their destruotion necessary.
