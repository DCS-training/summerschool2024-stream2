kept in proper repair.  To one master, who teaches church-
music, writing, reading, and arithmetic, they give L. 10
yearly.  They have also established a schoolmaster for clas-

which, not only reading English, arithmetic, and classical
learning, is to be taught, but Greek, French, geography,
book-keeping, and various branches of the mathematics,
with land-surveying, and drawing.  The magistrates have
subscribed, for carrying this plan into effect, L. 42 Sterling a-
year, and the inhabitants have contributed already about 
L. 500 Sterling; and, depending on the liberality of the pub-

sist them.-There are also Sunday schools established in the
town, and with success.
