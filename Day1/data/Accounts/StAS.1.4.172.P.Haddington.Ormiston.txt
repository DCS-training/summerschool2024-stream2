little rain gently falling in the west, and the arch appear-

stoun Hall, there is a remarkable yew tree.  Its trunk is
11 feet in circumference, and 25 feet in length; the diameter
of the ground overspread by its branches is 53 feet; and
there is about the 20th part of an English acre covered by
it  This tree is still growing in full vigour, without the
least sympton of decay in any of its branches, which in-
crease yearly in length about an inch.  There is no tradi-
tion that can be depended upon, for exactly ascertaining its
age; but from the best information, it cannot be under 200
years old.  It seems rather more probable to be between 
300 and 400 years old.
