			PARISH OF PORTPATRICK.

		PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY.

              THE REV. ANDREW URQUHART, A. M. MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name of the Parish.--The lands which at present constitute
the parish of Porpatrick were formerly called the Black Quarter
of the Inch, and till 1628, formed a part of the parish of Inch,
having pertained to the ancient Abbacy of Saulset or Soulseat.
For some time before and after this date, the harbour and adjoin-
ing village were very commonly called Portmontgomery, in ho-
nour of the Montgomeries, Lords of Ardes in Ireland, who were
the propietors for a considerable period. But when the parish
was erebted, it received the ancient name of the harbour, which
it has ever since retained, and which has completely superseded
the name of Portmontgomery. A marvellous story used to be
told here of the famous Irish Saint Patrick having crossed the
channel at a single stride, and the mark of his foot war shown on
a rock, that has been removed in the operations connected with the
construction of the present harbour. Whether this superstition is
of Scotch or Irish origin does not appear; but it is probably con-
nected with some historical fact, and with the origin of the name
Portpatrick. Another story, undoubtedly Irish, bears that St
Patrick, having been beheaded somewhere north of Glenap, took
his head under his arm, and walked to Portpatrick, where, being
unable to find a boat, he took his head in his teeth and swam across
to Ireland.
	Boundaries.--The parish occupies about four miles of the coast
of the Irish Channel, rather nearer the northern than the southern
extremity of the peninsula, which, extending from north north-west
to south south-east, about 28 miles in length, and 5 1/2 in its great-
est breadth, and containing the parishes of Kirkcolm, Leswalt,
Portpatrick, Stonykirk, and Kirkmaiden, is joined to the mainland,
     WIGTON. 				I
