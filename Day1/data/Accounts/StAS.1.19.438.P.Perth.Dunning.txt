duals, but of society at large.  The surest part of the foun-
dation of private and public happiness is laid in an early
education, as it is generally conducted in the parochial
schools of Scotland.  Habits of attention, application, and
cleanliness are acquired; the faculties of the soul are gra-

it is presumed that the youth of the parish of Dunning will
be found to make considerable progress in any part of edu-
