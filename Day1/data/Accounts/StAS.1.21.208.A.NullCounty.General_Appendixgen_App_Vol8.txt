fire irons; even the locks and hinges of the doors are consum-
ed by the smoke.  The scarcity and dearth of fuel will in a
short time render this and several neighbouring parishes deso-
late, if not prevented by taking off the duty from coals car-
ried coast-ways.
   The people here are poor in general, having no manufac-
tures; though no country is better calculated for them, as it
is very populous, and great quantities of corn are raised and
exported.
   Farming, which is the only means they have of living, is
now become so expensive, that unless a man can with his
own children manage the farm, he cannot afford to pay the
rent and servants wages.  Their whole summer's employment
is to carry their fuel the distance of 10 or 12 miles, to the
great destruction of horses and carts.  There is no wood with-
in 10 miles, except some firs lately planted by some neigh-
bouring proprietors; these, in the space of 20 or 30 years,
will be of great service for fuel.
   The people here are very temperate and industrious, con-
sequently healthy.  The only local disease is the scrophula, with
which many of them are infected, owing, as some say, to
the quantity of pease-meal and fish they feed on; others af-
firm it never was seen here till Oliver Cromwell's soldiers
brought it under another name.

   Natural Curiosities.-The most remarkable curiosities in this.
parish are some extensive caves on the sea side, where there
are abundance of freestone quarries; and in these rocks are
some very extensive grand caverns, reaching under ground
farther than can be searched: some 100 yards, others more,
in breadth, and from 60 to 100 yards in height; others
smaller, but very prettily scooped out by the frequent wash-
ings of the sea.
