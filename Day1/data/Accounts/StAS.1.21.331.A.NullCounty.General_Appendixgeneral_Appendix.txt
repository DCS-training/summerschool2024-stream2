     The Statistical Account.

little reluctance ought perhaps to be shewn in receiving the
ignorance and simplicity, on which that happiness was found-
ed.  But the latter is irrecoverably lost; luxury, refinement,
and dissipation, are too universally diffused, and too deeply
rooted, to admit of being eradicated;-all we can do, is to
counteract their bad effects, by directing the mind to the pur-
suit of useful knowledge, and by fortifying it against the in-
cursions of passion and appetite, by every consideration, which
religion, philosophy, and science, afford.  The nearest ap-
proach; that can now be made to the times of innocence,
must take place in an agricultural life, where enlightened
reason furnishes enjoyment, and protects from the contagion
of vices, of which it is impossible to be ignorant.*
   'Men employed in cultivating the soil, if suffered to enjoy
'a reasonable independence, and a just share of the produce
'of their toil, are of simpler manners, and more virtuous,
'honest, dispositions, than any other class of men.  The tes-
'timony of all observers, in every age and country, concurs
'in this; and the reason of it may be found in the nature of
'their industry, and its reward.  Their industry is not like
'that of the labouring manufacturer, insipidly uniform, but
'varied; it excludes idleness without imposing excessive
'drudgery, and its reward consists in abundance of necessary
'accommodations, without luxury and refinement.'++  Such
are the words of a distinguished philosopher and philanthro-
pist of the present day, the extension and accuracy of whose
political views have not often been excelled; and I am hap-
py to add; from his own authority, that he highly approves
