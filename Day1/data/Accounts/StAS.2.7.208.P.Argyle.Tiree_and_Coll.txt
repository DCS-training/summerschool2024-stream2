   There is a parish register likewise kept in Coll.  The earliest
entry is dated 1732, but the day and month are omitted.  It ap-
pears to have been pretty regularly kept since that period.
   Modern Buildings.-The only buildings of this description
entitled to notice, are those connected with the lighthouse pro-
posed to be erected on Sceir-Mhor, several of which have been
already built, or are now in progress, such as houses for the ac-
commodation of the tradesmen and workmen employed, working
sheds, coal and boat-houses, smithies, &c.  But the most import-
ant of them is a signal or watch-tower, upwards of thirty feet high,
now nearly finished, which is intended to communicate by signal
or telegraph with the-light-house, and also to serve as a beacon
to any vessels or boats coming to the pier under night.  These
are all built of granite and other ordinary materials.

   There are of proprietors possessing lands of the yearly value
of L.50 and upwards, four, of whom only one presently resides
in the parish.

<FOOTNOTE>It may be proper to state that no register of deaths is kept ;  but, by, comparing
the number of baptisms with the rate of increase, and making a small allowance for a
few persons who occasionally remove from the parish, a sufficiently accurate estimate
of the number may be formed.
