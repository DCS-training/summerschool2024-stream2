	Kirkville House, belonging to William Knowles, Esq. is of mo-
dern date, having been built within the last twenty years: it is in
the cottage style.
         Antiquities.-Besider the Druidical temples and tumuli noticed
in the former Account, with the Hill of Keir, the top of which
seems to have been well adapted for a watch-tower in former days,
we have now to mention two Roman urns and a Roman sword, and
the points of two spears, which have been lately found near the line
of the Roman road, passing through the parish from the river Dee
to the Don. These relics are in the possession of the proprietor
of Kirkville, on whose lands they were found. Among the anti-
quities may also be noticed some valuable manuscripts in the li-
brary at Skene House, beautifully written previous to the inven-
tion of printing; and, not less valuable to the proprietors of the
lands of Skene, the identical shian by which the lands were won,
said to be in the possession of a relative of the family. A stone,*
bearing the inscription, "Drum stone, Harlaw, 1411," stands on
a height upon the lands of Easterskene.
