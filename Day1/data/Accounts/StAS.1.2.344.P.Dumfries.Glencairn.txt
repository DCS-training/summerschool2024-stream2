been found adequate to the necessities of the poor, who are
pretty numerous, as their occupations, while in health, can
only supply their present exigencies, and do not enable them
to lay up for old age and disease.  The charge of living, and
the hire of labourers, and servants of every denomination, con-
tinually increases.  A common labourer gets L. 6 or 8, and some
L. 10, in the year, besides bed, board, and washing; and 8d. or,
indeed, at some employments, 1s. per day, besides victuals.
There are, however, as yet, but few who get so much as L. 10
a year; and these are commonly such as have the charge and
direction of others, besides working themselves.  But if things
go on, as they have done for some years past, such high wages
will doubtless become more frequent.  All these circumstan-
ces bear very hard upon those, who have but a limited income,
such as was barely sufficient for a decent support, in their re-
spective stations, 60 or 70 years ago.
