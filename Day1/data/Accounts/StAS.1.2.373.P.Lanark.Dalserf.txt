adjacent valleys.  The most remarkable instance of this kind,
was on the 12th of March, 1782, when the water rose here 3
feet higher that was ever remembered, (being 17 feet perpen-
dicular, above the ordinary surface of low water,) and swept
away several mills and mill-dams, leaving scarcely a vestige
behind.-There is a ferry-boat upon the Clyde, near the pa-
rish church, and one upon the Avon, at a place called Mil-
heugh, but there are no bridges over any of the rivers in this
parish.

   Buildings.-Dalserf house, the residence of Captain James
Hamilton of Broomhill, is a neat modern building, standing up-
on an eminence, near the village of Dalserf, and commands a
charming prospect, both up and down the Clyde.  Broomhill
house, which also belongs to the same gentleman, and which
was the feat of the antient family of the Hamiltons of Broom-
hill, (the elder branch of which were created Lords Belhaven),
stands upon the top of the banks of the river Avon, in a fine
airy situation, having a most agreeble view of the country a-
round, and of the river Avon, with its pleasant banks.  Mr
Hamilton, induced by the remarkable beauty of the situation,
is now building another house, upon an eminence above the
village of Dalserf; which commands one of the most extensive
and delightful prospects, that can well be imagined.

   Villages.-The village of Dalserf stands in a low snug si-
tuation, under the banks of the Clyde, having a large fertile
valley, called Dalserf Holm, to the eastward; round which,
the river makes a circular sweep.  In the village stands a hand-
some parish church, with a clock and spirel; and, at some dis-
tance, upon the rising ground, is the parsonage house, or mi-
nister's manse, which commands a delightful prospect.-
This place is samed for the abundance of excellent fruit, par-
