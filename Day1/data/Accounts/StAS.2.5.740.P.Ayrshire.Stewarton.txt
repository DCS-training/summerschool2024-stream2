ing among the lower classes, and ideas generally prevail, that the
wealthy are bound to support the poorer classes, from whatever
cause this poverty may arise. For some years prior to 1839, the
collections at the church averaged L. 100, and the assessment
on the heritors above L. 200, a year.

miles distant,
			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	Near the farm-house of Low Chapelton, above a mile below
Stewarton, on the right bank of the Annock, there appears to have
once been a chapel, the ruins of which were lately dug up, when
the proprietor was engaged in planting trees. There are now no
records remaining of this place of worship. There are several
farms in the neighbourhood called Chapelton, which are under-
stood to have derived their name from this place.
	Of the three founders of the Maitland Club of Glasgow in
1828, only one survives, (John Kerr, Esq. writer, Glasgow,) and
he is a native of this parish.
