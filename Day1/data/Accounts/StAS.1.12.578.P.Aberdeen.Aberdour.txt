About half a mile English E. from the church, is the site and
remains of the ancient castle of Dundargue, upon a rock of
red free-stone, 64 feet high from the beach immediately below,
261 feet in length, 38 feet mean breadth, making an area of
nearly 29 falls, surrounded by the lea, when the tide flows,
except a narrow neck of rock and earth, which joins the castle
rock to the land, the breadth 12 feet, where it joins the land,
but decreases gradually, till it reach the entry of the castle,
where it is only about 4 feet wide.  Here the rock has been
cut, but in place of the draw-bridge, which (it is probable)
has formerly given access to the castle, the narrow rock is
made up with earth, in order to enable the tenants' cattle to
get at the fine grass, which grows on the rock*.  There is a

22 feet broad, 11 feet high, and the arch most neatly jointed.  The other
cave is parallel to this, and distant room it only 42 feet, is never quite dry at
low water, but can be passed through with dry foot, upon a number of large
stones which lie in it: it is 100 feet long, 24 feet broad, 13 feet high, and
the rock over these is 70 feet high, and is joined to the main land by a neck of
earth, of about 2 feet wide; a part of the rock runs off on the E. side, al-
most at right angles from the caves, and forms an arch 46 feet broad, and 21 feet
high, through which the sea also flows at high water.

*The only part of the castle now standing, is the entry.  The whole breadth
of the front is only 12 feet, the door is 4 feet 2 inches wide, 6 feet high, and is
arched; the height of the walls 12 feet 7 inches; the length of the side-walls
still standing, is 10 feet 6 inches; there are no other remains of the castle walls,
except the inside of the foundation, the outside having fallen down, owing to the
mouldering away of the rock on which it was built.  There is a fine level green,
where the outworks have been, which has been secured on the land side, by a
wall (the foundation of which still remains) of the same kind of stone with the
castle rock, cemented with lime, after the manner of what is commonly called
run-lime, as the remains of the castle have also been, and which renders the
walls so firm, that you may more easily break the stone, than separate it from the
lime; on the outside of this wall or rampart, is a dry ditch 296 feet long, and
still 30 feet wide, and 6 feet deep: running parallel to this, are 2 other ditches,
of the same length with it; the first of these is 12 feet wide, and 10 feet deep,
the mound, or the distance between it and the dry ditch, or moSt last mentioned,
