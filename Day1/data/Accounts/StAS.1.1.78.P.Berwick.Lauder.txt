old road to Melrose, where it is probable some battles have
been fought, as fragments of swords, bows, and arrows, are
found there; but no record or traditon is known concerning
them.  The arrows were pointed with flint-stone, tapering
from the juncture, about an inch long.

   Lauder Fort.-Towards the north of the tower of Lauder,
by the river side, stands Lauder fort.  This fabric is near
500 years old.  It was built by Edward Longshanks, who
had over-run Scotland.  It was rebuilt, and converted into a
dwelling-house, by the Duke of Lauderdale, in the end of the
last century.  There are some noble apartments in it, and rich
stucco work, according to the taste of that age.  One of the
old apartments is preserved as a curiosity.
