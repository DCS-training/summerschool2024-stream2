bore the name of the Keledee, who had been born, or educated,
or buried in, or near such places.  From Cella Winnini, there-
fore, it is highly probable this parish takes its name.  There
is a well, at no great distance from the manse, called Winning's
Well; and a fair, held annually, on the first day of February,
is called Winning's-day Fair.  Not many years after the erec-
tion of the monastery, Kilwinning, all over this part of the
country, was called Saig-town; and, by this name, it is still
very well know to the inhabitants.  Saig-town is evidently a
corruption of Saints-town.  From the mortified and contemp-
lative lives of the monks, from the frequency of their devo-
tions, and other religious exercises, and from their reputation
for learning and knowledge, they were regarded by the su-
perstitious, ignorant, and credulous laity, as an order of su-
perior beings.  Nothing, therefore, could be more natural,
than to call the place, where persons of such characters lived,
Saig-town, or the Town of the Saints.  It ought also to be
observed, as it very strongly marks the spirit and manners
of those dark ages, that the fairs, in all the towns and villages
connected with the monastery, were named after some parti-
cular saint, who was afterwards accounted the protector or
tutelar saint of the place: Such as, St. Anthony, St. Colm, or
Columba, St. Margaret, St. Bride, or Bridget.  The days on
which these fairs are held, are still called after the saint whose
name they bear; as, Colm's-day, Margaret's-day, etc

   Situation and Extent.-It is situated in Cunninghame, one
of the districts or subdivisions of the county of ayr, and is
separated from the West Coast, or Irish Sea, by part of the
parishes of Irvine and Stevenstown.  It is supposed to be 9
English miles in length, and, in some parts of it, not much
less in breadth.  The figure, however, it forms, is very irre-
gular, being in several places intersected by the neighbouring
