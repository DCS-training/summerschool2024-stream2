     Statistical Account

volence; and the liberality of individuals, on various oc-
casions, is a fact which consists with the knowledge of the
writer of this account.

   Church.-The parish church, which stands at the N. E.
end of the town, was mostly rebuilt in 1730; and, about
24 years ago, was completely repaired within.  The pa-
tronage and teinds, some time after the Reformation, were
given away by the Crown to the family of Vans of Barn-
barroch; and transferred by them, towards the middle of
the last century, into the family of the Earl of Galloway,
who is still both patron and titular.  The stipend consists
of 72 L. in money, and 4 chalders of victual, 2 of them in
barley, and 2 in meal.  The glebe consists of about 7
acres, and, from its vicinity to the town, is worth 14 L.
yearly.  There is neither a manse nor office-houses here,
but an allowance of 12 L. a year for manse rent.  The
total amount of the living, made up of these several par-
ticulars, is about 140 L. Sterling.

   Poor.-The number of poor on the parish roll, is al-
ways upwards of 40.  The funds for their maintenance
arise partly from the interest of money appropriated to that
purpose, and partly from the weekly collections at the
door of the church.  The total amount, of about 40 L. a
year, is divided quarterly by the kirk-session, among the
poor, according to their several necessities.  They all re-
side within their own houses, and earn a part of their own
subsistence.  But the maintenance of their own poor, is
not the only burden of this kind on the parish.  The place
is infested by swarms of strolling beggars; the law for re-
straining them never being put in execution either in the
town or country.
