   The churning of milk makes a great and laborious part
of the farmers work.  Of late they have introduced the use
of churning-mills driven by water.  There are many streams
which run through the parrish, and answer for these mills,
and, on trial, they prove highly beneficial, and save a great

   Moat.-The cornmonty belonging to the heritors is about
1600 acres in extent.  It is always covered with the most
beautiful verdure, and produces very good grass and clover,

parish.  In this cornmonty there are three lochs, well stock-

Loch, are of a smaller size.  These lochs afford plentiful
supplies of water for the public works, in this and the neighs-

   Heritors and Rent.-The landed property of the parish is
at present divided among 60 heritors, the greater part of

Mr Logan of Findleton; and Mr Wilson of Netherhouse.
Several of these are resident.  They have excellent modern
mansion-houses on their estates, and are exemplary and active
