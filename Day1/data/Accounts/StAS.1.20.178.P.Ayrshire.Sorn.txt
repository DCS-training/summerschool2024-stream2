     Statistical Account

   The change which a few years have produced in the ap-
pearance of the ground, in the vicinity of this manufacturing
village, is truly astonishing.  Some years ago, Mr Alexan-
der made a number of small inclosures, in the immediate
neighbourhood of the village, for the accommodation of
those inhabitants who wished to keep milch-cows.  He dres-
sed them with potatoes on the above plan; and, after ta-
king a crop of beer or barley, with the succeeding hay-crop,
he let them out by the year in grass, at L. 1, 13 s. per acre.
The same land did not yield him formerly 10 s. per acre,
on a 19 years lease.  Within these few weeks, he has sown
down a field, of about 13 or 14 acres, with wheat, which
produced a crop of potatoes last summer, dressed by the vil-
lagers.
   Mr Alexander retains a farm of some hundred acres in his
own hands; but as it, and the most of his landed property,
lie in the neighbouring parish of Mauchline, a description of
his spirited improvements, as a farmer, does not fall to my
province.
   Weaving is only in its infancy here; however, a hundred
looms are erected, but they are seldom all occupied at the
same time.  At present 91 are at work, and are chiefly
employed by the cotton manufactures in Glasgow and
Paisley.  The yarn spun here is sent to Glasgow weekly by
the Company's carrier.
   A brewery was built in the year 1793, by the proprie-
tor of the village, and let to a very respectable gentleman in
Kilmarnock, with a view to introduce malt-liquor in place
of whisky, which has so baneful an effect on the morals of
the people.  It gives me pleasure to add, that this benevo-
lent scheme has, in a great degree answered its purpose;
for nearly 500 bolls of malt are brewed annually.  The
brewery is not completed; for only a part of the original
