            ing the landscape, distinct as in ` map; while directly in the fore-
            ground the whole level expanse of the richly cultivated Appin is
            spread out before the eye like a well-watered garden, headed by
            the bluff-looking Hill of Drummond, having its southern base
            washed by the gentle Tay gliding between its sylvan banks, and its
            northern by the furious Lyon pouring down its rocky channel, un-
            til it joins the former meandering gently along the southern
            boundary of the vale below, --presenting an agricultural panorama,
            perhaps, without a parallel in the Highlands of Scotland.  Con-
            trasted with this lowland scenery appear to the north-east the
            Sidlaw Hills facing the celebrated Hill of Birnam, proudly rising
            its head above its fellows in the south-east; immediately in the
            north-west boundary of the parish the huge Schiehallion rears its
            lofty head, while the wild summits of the still loftier Benlawers
            rise upon the view to the west, and, stretching away in a long
            vista, the conical Benmore recedes gradually in the distant haze,
            furnishing a termination of awful grandeur to the scene.
               Caves.--High up the Cliff, and on the north-west side of the
            principal F`ll of the Tummel, a gloomy cave, accessible only by
            clambering along the face of the impending rock, is pointed out
            where a party of the clan Alpin sought an asylum from the cruel
            persecutions to which they and their proscribed race were then
            continually exposed.  Here, however, they enjoyed neither safety
            nor repose of any duration ere they were detected by some of
            their numerous and unrelenting pursuers, led hither by their blood-
            hounds.  The unhappy outlaws defended for a time their rocky
            domicile, with their wonted fortitude, but, being at last overpower-
            ed by superior force, the remaining few, at one desperate effort,
            broke through their implacable foes, and, with amazing agility,
            sprung into a tree which overhung the lofty and giddy precipice.
            Thither their enraged persecutors had not the courage to follow
            them, but they instantly commenced to cut down the tree with
            their heavy claymores, and never ceased until they hurled both it
            and the unfortunate Macgregors into the gulf below.
               Meteorology.--The most marked trait in the meteorology of
            this parish, is the dense masses of fog or mist to which its straths,
            are subject in spring and autumn, with the exception, perhaps, of
            Glenfincastle, which is considerably elevated above the bed of
            the river, and has no remarkable stream of its own to attract
            them.
               Climate.--While in the lower grounds of Appin, the crops are
