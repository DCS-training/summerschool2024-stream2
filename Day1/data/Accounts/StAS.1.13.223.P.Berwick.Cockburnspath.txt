   Agriculture.-In this parish we meet with every variety
both of soil and of climate, and a general spirit of industry
and emulation prevails among the tenants, which leads
them to make the most of every situation.  The soil of the
lower division is partly strong and partly light, each good
of its kind; but they answer best when combined together
in one farm, as by this means a farmer can employ his
strength at all seasons, and in all weathers.  The rotation
for the strong land, which lies chiefly along the shore, is
fallow, wheat or barley, with broad clover and rye-grass;
after the clover, oats; then pease or beans; and again bar-
ley or wheat.  The best farmers frequently sow barley
after fallow, instead of wheat; for it is difficult upon strong
land, except after fallow, to hit the proper season for bar-
ley, and then the ground is in fine preparation for grass-
seeds; whereas wheat upon fallow is often too strong, and
consequently false, and the grass-seeds sown with it fre-
quently fail; on the other hand, wheat after beans or pease,
if the ground is clean, seldom fails to yield a good increase.
The rotation upon the light land of the lower division of
the parish, which lies principally upon its upper side, is
turnip, barley, clover, oats.  The upper division of the pa-
rish, making part of Lammermuir, partakes somewhat of
its soil and climate; but by the industry of the farmers
and proprietors, in the cultivation of turnip and grass, and
the proper use of lime, the face of the country has been
greatly changed for the better.
   Great tracts of land, which formerly were covered with
heath, or over-run with furze, being brought to a set
of excellent breeding farms, great part of which is kept in
pasture.  In these farms the sheep have been much im-
