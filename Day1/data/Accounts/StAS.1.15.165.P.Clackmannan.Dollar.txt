first town in Britain, (we may even say in the World,) for
this manufacture; the table linen made there being, both in
point of quality and variety of patterns, incomparably supe-
rior to what is to be found any where else.  Nor can any
place supply the demands to London, and ether places for
that article, upon the same terms.  Besides, the author is
well informed, that improvements are daily making in seve-
ral branches of that business, which promise to be of great
service with regard to the elegance of the patterns*.  The
new chemical method of bleaching, by the oxygenated muriatic
acid, has been tried at this field with much success.  In the
year 1790, Mr Haig gained a premium from the Honourable
Board of Trustees for that method of bleaching.  Since that
time, he hath made several valuable discoveries, both as to
the preparation and application of this acid, and finds it very
useful; particularly at the end of the season, when the sun
so greatly loses its influence.  He then finishes off goods by
this method of bleaching, which otherwise could not be
done until the next year.  By this method, he bleaches cotton
goods through the whole season; and finds it much better
adapted for cotton than for linen.  In this parish there are
two mills for grain, one of them has machinery for making
barley, and rollers for grinding malt.  There are also two
waulk mills for scouring cloth, etc.

employers.
