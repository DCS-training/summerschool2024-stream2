				III.-POPULATION.
	   There is good reason to believe that this parish is not now so po-
	lous as formerly.   Within the remembrance of very old persons
	yet living, it had three public-houses, two meal-mills, one brewer,
	and one baker.  It has none of this now except one public-house.
	It also contained at a former period one village, if not more. This
	village was called Clien, and must have been of considerable size,
	as there is a saying among old people, that " it had a reeking lum
	in it for ‚very house in the parish of Semmiedores," (St Madoes.)
	The parish of St Madoes is, indeed, a small one, and probably
	contains fewer houses now than it did then; but if these could be
	all brought together, they would form a pretty large village. So
	the one in question could not have been very small.
	   The following is the state of the populationa at the different pe-
	riods mentioned:

	   Population in			           1772,         710
	   By old Statistical Account in                   1793,         628
	   Government census in                            1801,         646
							   1811,         621
							   1820,         802
							   1831,         792
							   1841,         720
	   What may have been the causes of the increase or decrease of
	population at distant periods, is not now well known ; but the great
	increase in 1821 was owing to the building of Kinfaus Castlem,
	which was then going on, and which drew a great number of arti-
	sans and labourers from other parishes, and, of course, as many of
	these as lodged within this parish were included in the population
	return thereof for that year.
	   There is at present neither town nor village in this parish the
	largest hamlet containing only 14 families.
