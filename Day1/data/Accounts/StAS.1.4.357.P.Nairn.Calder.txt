     of Calder.

village was begun at Calder some years ago, but not im-
proved to any height.  It may contain about a score of fa-
milies, consisting chiefly of tradesmen, labourers, and the 
servants who have the charge of the cattle.-Peat is the
most common fuel.  Wood, furze, broom, &c. are also
used.
