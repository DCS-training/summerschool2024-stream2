tions resulting from it, was particularly distinguished for his
integrity; and therefore the accounts of the mines, contained
in the register now mentioned, may with safety be relied on,
as just and accurate, and strictly corresponding to appearances,
as he had not the smallest tendency to exaggerate his descrip-

together disclaimed, yet there is one observation, which pre-
sents itself so frequently to any, even the most careless, inqui-
rer, that it may be fairly hazarded: That, were new trials to

to examine them with some degree of attention.  This is hap-

of which has already been given, which were undeniably more

banks of that river, in the estate of Alva, and extend from one
extremity of the parish to the other.  It was worked by the
late Sir John Erskine, about sixty years ago, and a considera-
