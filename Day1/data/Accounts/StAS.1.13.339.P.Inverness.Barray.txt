heritor has built a good school-house, as also a house for the 
master, and has furnished the schoolmaster with all the con-
veniences required by the Society.  At the last visitation 
upwards of 40 scholars attended; it might be of consider-
able benefit if it was equally well throughout the year;
but in the busy seasons, such as feed-time and harvest, the 
parents are obliged to withdraw their children.  There 
are three places of worship, viz.  Kilbar, Borve, and Wa-
tersay.  The minister preaches two Sundays at Borve,
which is only a mile and a half from his own house; the 
third Sunday at Kilbar, at the distance of 3 miles; and the 
fourth at Watersay, which, including a ferry of 1 mile, is 
at the distance of 5 miles. The inhabitants of the South

twice a-year, unless by a paticular call to visit the sick,
and to administer extreme unction.  What renders this 
parish singularly troublesome, is its distance from the seats 
of Presbytery and Synod; the first is in  North Uist, at the 
distance of 40 miles, besides a fery of 8 miles, where he 
attends two stated Presbyteries in the year, the one in the 
beginning of December, and the other the middles of 
March; besides occasional meetings, and attendance upon 
sacraments in North Uist and Harris, the last of which is 
at the distance of near 60 miles, besides the ferry already
mentioned, and that between North Uist and Harris, 12 
miles in lenght; this distance the minister is sometimes under 
the necessity of walking in foot, though at other times,
when horses are in good order, he is obliged to the gene-
rosity of the principal gentlemen on the way for use of 
their horses, which he takes this occasion to acknowledge.
The seat of the Synod, which is Glenelg, on the continent
of Scotland, is at the distance of 30 leagues by sea, when he 
must be at the expense of boat and crew; and if he goes 
from hence to North Uist, to take passage by the packet-
