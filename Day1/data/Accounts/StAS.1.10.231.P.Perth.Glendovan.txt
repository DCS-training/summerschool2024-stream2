to the method of rearing their own sheep, but keep up their
stocks by purchasing hogs* every year from the Linton mar-
ket.  Those who buy in, sell off their lambs to the sheep
farmers in the Highlands, or to the butchers.  A few, how-
ever, have been in the practice of rearing their own sheep,
and have in a great measure succeeded; and all might do it,
if they would reserve their hog-fence for the winter, as is
practised in the more improved farms; though, in general,
they want heath, whins thrive wherever sown.  Wedders are
sold at 4 years old at about 15 s.  Most of the farms rent at
above 100 L. a year.  The farmers endeavour to have one
kind of sheep nearly by itself, but they allow them to feed at
large, never collecting them unless for shearing, etc.  They
smear with tar and butter, mixed together, their hogs and
sometimes their ewes; and it is imagined it would be profit-
able to smear the whose, since it is an effectual preservative
against the scab.  The lambs are sometimes very subject to
the braxey, for which they have got no effectual remedy.  An
experiment has been lately tried to cross their black faced
sheep with Cheviot tups; as far as can be yet known it pro-
mises success; the lambs of this cross breed are equally strong
and healthy.  Should that experiment answer the expecta-
tion of those gentlemen who have bestowed so much atten-
tion on the improvement of sheep, it would be of essential
service to this place, as the farmers then would have a better
market and higher prices for their wool.  Their wool sells at
from 10 s. to 12 s. and their laid wool at from 6 s. to 7 s. the
stone, of the former 7 1/2 fleeces make one stone, and of the
latter 5 1/2 fleeces, both taken at an average.  The difference
in point of size between these fine woolled sheep, and the
black faced, of which their stock now consists, is not consi-
