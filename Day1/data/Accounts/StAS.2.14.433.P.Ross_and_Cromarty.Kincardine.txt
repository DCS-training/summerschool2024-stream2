increased facilities of internal communication by roads, conveyances,
&c. The wages of labourers, and price of cattle, have also
increased considerably.  At present a boll of oatmeal of the same
measure as then sells for L. 1, 4s. ; a boll of oats, L. I ; and of
barley, L. 1, 10s.  Butter, which was formerly 12s. the Scotch
stone, and cheese 4s., now bring, respectively, L. 1, Is. and 8s. for
the same quantity.  A good ploughman gets from L. 6 to L 9 a year
of wages; a woman from L. 2 to L. 5 for the same period;
and a day-labourer, who used to receive 8d. in summers and 6d. in
winter, per diem, will now not be content with less than Is. 6d. or
2s. This rise in the priced of provisions and wages is very striking.
There has also-been a great improvement in the comfort of the
cottages, and in the dress and habits of the people; and the system
of farming in this parish is quite changed, as also the manner
of letting farms.
