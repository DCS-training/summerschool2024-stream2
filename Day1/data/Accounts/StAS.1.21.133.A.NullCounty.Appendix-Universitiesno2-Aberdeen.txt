   Observatory.-A small but commodious observatory was
crewed on the Castle hill of Aberdeen, in the year 1781, up-
on a spot of ground granted by the magistrates for that pur-
pose, and finished and furnished with instruments by the be-
nevolent assistance received from the Earl of Bute, then chan-
cellor of the University, but chiefly by contributions from
the gentlemen of the town and neighbouring country.  It
consisted of two circular rooms, of about 12 feet diameter,
having moveable roofs axed apertures for the observations;
to which was afterwards added a third apartment for the
equatorial instrument and other apparatus.  It was provided
with the following instruments:
   A transit telescope, of four feet focus, and three inches
aperture; by Ramsden.
   A moveable quadrant, of two feet radius, made by Mac-
culloch, and divided with great accuracy by Troughton.
   A very superb equatorial instrument, with circles of eigh-
teen inches diameter, originally made by Sisson; but after-
wards divided anew, and an achromatic telescope, with re-
fraction apparatus, added by Ramsden.
   A double achromatic telescope, of four feet focus, and two
and three fourth inches aperture, moving on a polar axis,
and having a divided object glass micrometer; by Dollond.
   A Newtonian reflecting telescope, of five feet focus, by
Hearne; and a twelve inch Gregorian telescope, by Short.
   A time keeper, with a Gridiron pendulum, by Mariott.
   An assistant clock, for counting the minutes and seconds,
by the stroke of a hammer upon bells; made by Gartly, Aber-
deen: also, an alarm clock, barometer, thermometer, etc.
The equatorial and transit instruments were presented by the
Earl of Bute.  An astronomical clock, exhibiting various mo-
