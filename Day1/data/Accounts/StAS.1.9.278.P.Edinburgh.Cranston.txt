the Forth at Tynningham.  Its banks are decorated with
handsome and noble seats.  In this parish, the magnificent
strutures of Oxenford castle and Preston hall, planted on
opposite banks of the river, the picturesque but natural
formation of grounds, the fields chequered with trees, and
crowned with corns; all these arrest the eye of the travel-
ler, and present to his view a landscape equal to some of
the most cultivated spots in England.

   Manufactures, etc.-The staple commodity of the parish
is corn.  Oats are carried to Dalkeith, where there is a
weekly market, the best in Scotland for that species of
grain, and sold to meal makers at a ready money price.
Pease and beans are carried to the same market.  Wheat
is sold to bakers or starch makers; and barley to brewers,
distillers, or barley makers.  Quarries of freestone, lime-
stone, and pitcoal, are wrought in several places, and make
a good return to the proprietors.  The price of a boll of
shells is 10 d. and 1 s.; and of a load of coals, equal to 2
cwt. 5 d.  Near to Cousland are a brick work and a pot-
tery.  At Upper Cranston, works have been lately erected
for extracting tar from pitcoal; an ingenious process, which
reflects much honour on the Earl of Dundonald, who made
the discovery, and enjoys by patent an exclusive privilege
for the manufacture.  The coals are put into ovens, and
after being kindled, are slowly decomposed; while the vo-
latile parts fly off into separate reservoirs, where they are
condensed.  Each condenser has two ovens appropriated
to it, and between the ovens and condensers is placed a
long leaden cistern filled with water, in order to hasten the
process.  The condensed fluid is then conveyed from the
condensers, by a cock into wooden pipes, which lead it in-
to a pit; from whence it is pumped into the still.  By the
act of distillation, or boiling, the steam flies off into another
