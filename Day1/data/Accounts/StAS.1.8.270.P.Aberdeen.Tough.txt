count.  It would be an invaluable source of improvement to
this district, particularly if coals were get duty free.

   Character, etc.-The people are in general very industri-
ous, frugal, humane, and obliging.  Their morals are thought
to be stricter now than 40 or 50 years ago.  Even the Sece-
ders have lost a great deal of that fiery, intemperate zeal,
which so strongly marked their character, about the time of
their first settlement in this parish.  There is no instance, in
the memory of man, of any individual being banished or capi-
tally convicted.  The general size of the people is about 5
feet 8 inches.  There are some individuals about six feet.

   Miscellaneous Observation.-The principal manufacture, in
this and the neighbouring parishes, is the knitting of stock-
ings.  In this the females are constantly employed, except
during the weeks of harvest.  In the year 1782 and 1783,
great scarcity prevailed, and had not a considerable quantity
of peasemeal been procured from abroad, and sent to this
country from Aberdeen, many of the inhabitants must have
been in danger of perishing.  It ought, however, to be re-
marked, that the women did so much extra work, by knit-
ting stockings, and the men by building dykes, that they
earned double the sum they usually gain in the same time; so
that the loss they sustained was not great, and the scarcity
was but little felt.-There are two or three tippling houses
in the parish, which have an evident tendency to corrupt the
morals of the people.  A good inn, for the accommodation
of travellers, is much wanted; and, it is presumed, a proper
inn-keeper would meet with good encouragement, as the pub-
lic road, from Aberdeen to Strath-don and the adjacent coun-
try, passes through this parish.
