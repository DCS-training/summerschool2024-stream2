	In the work above-mentioned, Mr Thorborn states, that the
population had decreased in number by 230 in the course of fifteen
years previous to the year 1791, which circumstance he accounts
for by "the town of Rothesay finding employment for day-labour-
ers and other workmen, and affording them higher wages than
they can receive in a country parish." Since that period, the most
considerable fluctuation in the state of the population is shows
in the increase of it by 148, betwixt the years 1791 and 1801,
for which no cause has been assigned: the decrease of it by 144,
betwixt the years 1821 and 1831, probably owing to the enlarge-
ment of farms, and the removal of cot-houses, which took place
about that time; and the increase of it by 94, betwixt the years
1881 and 1840, which is to be ascribed, partly, to the erection of
several villas in the interval; and partly, it is probable, to the
greater number of farm-servants required by the progress of agri-
cultural improvement in the parish during that period.
