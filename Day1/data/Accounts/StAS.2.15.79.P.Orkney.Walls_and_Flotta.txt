had much gratification in witnessing the Lord's Supper dispensed
on two successive summers in a place where it was never,before
known to be within the memory of man.
   Mr Macintosh, who is ordained as the minister, has done much
for the religious instruction of the young, and promoting a desire
for reading amongst the people. The happy termination of these
efforts calls for much gratitude, as the effects are already visible
in inducing a much more regular attendance upon ordinances in
both the parishes than when Divine service was so much inter-
rupted as under the former system. There are five licensed pub-
lic-houses in Walls, principally intended for the use of the ship-
Ping which frequent the Longhope; but I am happy to say, that
the sin of drunkenness, as well as of swearing, is now greatly redu-
ced, and we have good reasons for hoping, that there are indica-
tions of a very considerable improvement not only-in morals, but in
religious feeling.
