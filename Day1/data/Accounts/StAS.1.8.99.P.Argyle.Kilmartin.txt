attention to the regimen of their children upon these occa-
sions.  There is another complaint which prevails among
children, and generally those about 12 years of age and
under, called the hooping cough.  It is exceedingly severe, and
particularly dangerous, when it attacks very young children.
It is generally very lingering.  The continuance and severity
of it, may considerably depend, upon the season of the year
when it comes on.

   Wood, Cattle, etc.-The natural wood here, consists mostly
of oak and ash, with some birch and hazel, but not to any
great extent.  Within these 25 years, at different periods,
100,000 trees, it is said, have been planted upon one gentle-
man's property, of different kinds of fir, oak, ash, beech, elm,
and a variety of other trees.  Upon a few other properties,
there have been also some planted, though to a less extent.

   Cultivation and Produce.-There is no general survey of
this parish;  though a few of the heritors have got their estates
measured, yet neither the arable, nor the pasture ground, is laid
out by measure.  The arable land is divided into in-field and out-
field; the in-field into three equal parts; in one of these there is
bear, in another oats, and the third is mostly in potatoes.  Next
year, the bear follows the potatoes, oats the former bear, and
