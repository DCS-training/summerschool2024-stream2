for 4 months on the refuse of potatoes, and a little bruised
oats or barley, they weigh 10 or 12 stone.  Being killed so
young, they are very fine food, and of great service to a
family.  The number of sheep is about 2300, mostly of
the white-faced long-bodied kind, and weighing from
12 lb. to 14 lb. per quarter.  Till of late, little attention
was paid to the improvement of wool; but now the
couragement given by premiums, and the force of example,
have, perhaps, carried the flock of sheep here to as great
perfection in that respect as the climate and soil will admit.
The wool has sold for 18 s. per stone.  The common dis-
eases of the sheep are the rot, a kind of consumption occa-
sioned by overstocking the pastures, and by rainy seasons,
especially a rainy autumn; and the sturdy, or water in the
head, which attacks them when about a year old, chiefly in
the months of April, May, and June; and is of so corresive
a nature as to perforate the skull into holes large enough to
admit a pea or small bean.  One keep in 40 falls by this
disease.  Such as are affected by it become at first giddy, af-
terwards stupid, and seldom or never recover.  No ewes are
milked.  The theese and butter, made from cows milk,
are mostly consumed in the parish, especially the latter;
which is much used in solving the sheep, at the rate of
from 4 lb. to 6 lb. to the Scotch pint of tar.

   Population.-The population of this parish in 1755 a-
mounted to 672 souls. At present (January 1794) the
parish contains 217 families, and 860 persons; of whom
