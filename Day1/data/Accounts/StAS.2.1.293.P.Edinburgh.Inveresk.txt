   Commerce.--In the charter granted by the Earl of Lauderdale
in 1670, the dues arising from the harbour are mentioned as part
of the revenue. Previous to 1806, the harbour was enclosed by
bulwarks of dry stone; since that period a substantial quay has
been built, and the trade has in consequence increased. Former-
ly a very extensive trade was carried on by the inhabitants of Mus-
selburgh with Holland, and an annual fair was held which lasted
for a number of days in succession. The shallowness of the har-
bour, in which there is only 4 1/2 feet of water at neap-tides, prevents
all vessels but those of light burden from entering for the purposes
of trade. There is no vessel belonging to the port; those which
resort to it, besides coasting vessels belonging to this country, are
chiefly Dutch, Prussian, and Norwegian. Their cargoes consist
of rape and oil-cake, bone-dust, grain, wood, bark, hides, &c.
The shore dues are moderate on all imports excepting timber,
which pays one piece of the hundred. These dues let for about
L. 176 per annum. Since building the new quay, the magistrates
also levy 2d. per register ton on all vessels entering the harbour,
which may amount to L. 183 per annum. The following tables
of imports and exports for the years 1831 and 1839 will shew the
progressive increase of trade:
