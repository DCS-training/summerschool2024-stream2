N. W. boundaries of the parish, being less exposed to the sea
than other uncultivated places, might be planted, with profit
to the proprietor and advantage to the public.  For wood is
a scarce article on this coast, and does not thrive when much
exposed to the sea breezes.  The general inclination of the
ground is towards the S. and S. E.  Some farms indeed are
exposed to the S. W. fun, and decline to the river North Esk.
The whole lies well under the benign influence of the sun;
yet the crops come not soon to maturity.  The time of reap-
ing seldom begins before the middle of September; and harvest-
work is often not finished by the end of October.  This may
be accounted for, from the wetness and stiffness of the soil,
and the coldness of the climate.

   Soil.-The soil of the parish, in general, is deep clay.  In
some places, the clay is mixed with a little sand; and in
others, through long cultivation, and frequent application of
manures, a black loamy earth, from 15 to 18 inches deep, is
superinduced above the stiff clay.  The soil soon becomes wet
after rain, and unfit for tillage; but it also soon becomes dry
again, and fit for any improvement.  Its wetness is not so
much owing to natural springs of water, as to the rain water;
which being prevented from sinking to any considerable depth,
by the resistance of strong stiff clay, floats at or near the sur-
face, till it is exhaled by the sun, or dried up by the wind.
This accounts at once for the opposite impressions so soon made
upon it by rain, or fair weather.  The general depth of the
rain water, which annually falls on this part of the coast, has
been computed to be from 24 to 28 inches.  This computa-
tion is thought to be nearly accurate; but the rain that fell
last year, (1792) far exceeds it.  Such an immense quantity of
rain, in one year, is not in the remembrance of the oldest man
in the parish.
