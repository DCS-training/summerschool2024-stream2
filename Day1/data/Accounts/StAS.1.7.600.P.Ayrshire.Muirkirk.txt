There are no rocks either of size or shape sufficient to strike
the eye of the traveller, or deserve notice.  There are no re-
markable rivers that run through the parish, though a varie-
ty of lesser streams.  The principal are, the water of Ayr
and that of Greenock; the latter takes it name not from
its source, or from the adjacent country, but, in all probabi-
lity, from a range of farms near its banks; it joins the wa-
ter of Ayr at the boundary of the parish to the west.  The
last mentioned rises in this parish a few miles eastwards of the
manse.  It is soon swelled by a number of lesser streams; and
taking its course by Lorn, and the picturesque scenes of Bar-
skimming, at last runs into the sea, at the county town. 
Both of these waters abound with trout of a blackish colour,
but excellent quality, with some few eels, but here are scarce
any perch.  They have suffered much of late by the ravages
of poachers with nets, who, at once, pillage the rivers, and
destroy the more moderate sport of the angler, who seldom
fails to pour forth blessings liberally on them, as he returns
home with his basket much lighter than usual.

   Birds, etc.-The birds are much the same as in other parts
of Scotland.  It is to be regretted that there are few long-
sters of the grove; and indeed, except the sky-lark, few of
the spring, as the melody of the blackbird and thrush is sel-
dom heard.  The larger curlew or whaup, which hatches
here in summer; and returns to the sea shore in autumn, is
one of those early visitants that announce the approach of
spring, and call to begin the labours of the garden.  Like
the cuckoo*, it has little variety of notes, but it appears much

*The cuckoo has been celebrated in a little ode, that may
almost vie with the music of the spring (vide Logan's poems.)
