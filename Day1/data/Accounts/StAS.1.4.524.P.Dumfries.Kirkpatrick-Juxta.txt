two houses; now every house has at least one glass window.
In other respects, however, the houses of the common people
have improved little or nothing.  Seventy years ago, the
hire of 2 man servant was about L. 1, 4 s. of a woman
scarcely 10 s. a-year.-The common people were certainly
more ignorant 50 years ago than at present.  Several at
that time had not learned either to write or read; now they
can all read pretty well, and all the men at least can write.
Several of the farmers read history, magazines and news-
papers.  The vulgar read almost nothing but books on re-
ligious subjects.  Many of them are too fond of controver-
sial divinity; a taste which the Dissenters are very diligent
in promoting, and which the few books they are acquainted
with, are rather calculated to confirm.  To discourage this
unhappy propensity, so common through a great part of
Scotland, and to recommend books of a more rational and
instructive nature, seems an object worthy of a clergyman.
-Inoculation of the small-pox is far from being general in
this country.  The common people are strongly prejudiced
against it.  To this circumstance a large proportion of the
deaths which happen in this parish is to be ascribed.-Rheu-
matism is universally allowed to be much more common
now than it was 40 years ago.  I have heard no satisfac-
tory reasons assigned for its increase.  Thinner clothing,
and the more general use of linen next the skin, may per-
haps account for it in part.
