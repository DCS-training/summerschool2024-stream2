     of Galashiels.

   In the village of Galashiels, 581;-in Lindean, 51;-in
the country, 282.  There a re 209 families; of whom, 18 are
farmers, 28 are cottars, whose residence depends on their re-
maining in the same service; and all the rest are leaseholders
for a longer or shorter time.

   The number of deaths, marriages, and births cannot be as-
certained, because many bury at Lindean, and some in other
parishes; and many, from neighbouring parishes, bury at Ga-
lashiels.  Many of different sectaries also are not married by
established clergymen; and a still greater number neglect to
register the births of their children.  Yet the rapid increase of
population, and thriving state of the parish, are plainly evin-
ced by this circumstance, that, on the state of Mr Scot of
Gala alone, there have been built, within these 20 years, fix
farm houses, with complete office-houses, and 32 good dwell-
ing houses, in the village; besides 39 dwelling houses, (on a
part of the parish of Melrose, which lies immediately conti-
guous to it,) containing 201 inhabitants, not included in the
above statement; all of whom, except 4 families, removed
from Galashiels, for the sake of getting feus, in a spot more
convenient for carrying on their business.  This suburd, to
which hitherto no reference has been made, must necessarily
be included in the following information, relative to the dis-
eases, employment, character, and religious opinions of the
inhabitants.

   Air, Diseases, etc.-From the nature of the soil, the air
must be dry and healthy.  There never was, in the memory
of man, any destructive epidemical distemper in the parish.
Even the small-pox, measles, and chincough are not fatal, nor
very infectious.  Though each of these has repeatedly visited
the village, during the last 20 years, yet none of them, at a-
ny time, became general or violent among the children.  One
