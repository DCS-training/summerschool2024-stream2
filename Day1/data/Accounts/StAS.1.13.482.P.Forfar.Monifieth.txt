     Statistical Account

between the parishes of Dundee and Murroes, on the S.
W. and W.; that of Barry on the S. E. and of Monikie
on the E. N. E. N. and N. W.  No actual survey has
been made of the parish; but he who supposes it to con-
tain 3710 Scotch acres, will not be far from the truth.
The parish seems anciently to have been of less extent
than at present.  Its proportion of the links which skirt
the coast, may be safely supposed above 400 acres, and
seem all once to have been covered with water.  Adjoin-

   Surface, Rivulets, etc.-From the N. W. point of the
parish, out of a well at the foot of the hill of Dodd, in
that low range, reaching thence to the Knockhills near
Arbroath, and about 4 miles E. from the hill of Lorn, in
that high ridge of hills called Sidla, which extend from
Perth to Redhead, and are the southern boundary of Strath-
more, there issues a rivulet which waters for about a mile
the S. W. border of the parish, crosses it in an eastern di-
rection, and after meandring through the parish of Moni-
kie, returns, and dividing this parish for about 1/4 mile
from that of Barrie, and receiving the name of the Bud-
don Burn, loses itself in the aestuary.  About 1 1/8 mile S.
W. from the Buddon Burn, and about 1/8 mile in the same
direction from the village of Monifieth, the river Dighty
falls into the aestuary, after a S. E. course of abount 11
miles from its rise in the lake of Lundie, and about 1 1/2
mile from its entrance into this parish.  Where the Dighty
enters the parish, it is joined by the Burn of Murroes,
