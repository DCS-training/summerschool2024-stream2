   Ecclesiastical State.-The church was built by the late Earl
in 1773, and is one of the best small churches in Scotland.
There is a vault under it for the Kinnoul family, in which
the late Earl and one of his sisters lie interred.  The
manse, which was built in 1749, is pretty good and in to-
lerable repair.  The stipend was augmented last year,
and is now 32 bolls of meal, 16 bolls of barley, and
L. 74: 18: 8 9/12 ster. including L. 3: 6: 8 ster. for commu-
nion elements.  The Crown and the Earl of Kinnoul are vice-
patrons, the Bishop of Dunkeld having, before the union of
the two parishes, presented to the church of Aberdalgy,
which was in his diocese, and the proprietor of Duplin hav-
ing presented to the church of Duplin, which was in the dio-
cese of Dunblane.

   School.-The established school, which is the only one in
the parish, is well attended; several children come to it from
other parishes.  The schoolmaster has a house, school-house
and garden, and L. 10 ster. of a stated yearly salary.  As
session clerk, his salary is L. 1: 5 ster.  For some years past,
Mr Peddie, the present schoolmaster, has been allowed by
Lord Kinnoul, L. 3 ster. in addition to his salary, for his great-
er encouragement.  He deserves all the encouragement that
can be given him; few being better qualified to teach English,
writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and the first principles of
mathematics, and none more assiduous and diligent in teach-
ing them than he is.  It will not be deemed improper to add,
that he has acquired without any instructor, the rare talent of
communicating knowledge to the deaf and dumb, and of
teaching them to speak.  A boy of this description, not twelve
years of age, who never had another teacher, has made a very
great proficiency under him.  Already he articulates a great
many words pretty distinctly, and his articulation appears to
