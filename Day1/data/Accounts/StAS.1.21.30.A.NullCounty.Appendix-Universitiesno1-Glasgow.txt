branches are understood to require the study of five separate
sessions.
   During their attendance upon there courses of languages
and philosophy, and particularly before they enter the class of
natural philosophy, the students are expected to acquire a
knowledge of mathematics and algebra, for which there is a
separate professor, and which is understood to be subservient
to natural philosophy and to many of the practical arts.-
There is also a professor of practical astronomy, whose busi-
ness is to make observations, for the improvement of that
great branch of physics.-After the course of general edu-
cation, above-mentioned, a provision is made for what are
called the three learned professions, divinity, law, and medi-
cine.  For the peculiar education of churchmen there are
four professors;-the principal, who is primarius professor of
theology, and has, besides, the superintendance of the whole
University; and the respective professors of theology, of o-
riental languages, and of church-history.  This last is also
lecturer in civil history.
   In law there is only one professor.
   There are, by the constitution, no more than two profes-
sors allotted to the faculty of medicine; to wit, a professor of
the theory and practice of medicine, and a professor of ana-

with the assistance of private donations, has made an annual
provision for three additional lecturers; in chemistry, in ma-
teria medica, and in midwifery.
   The University has now the prospect of a great and impor-
tant addition being soon made to the faculty of medicine.
