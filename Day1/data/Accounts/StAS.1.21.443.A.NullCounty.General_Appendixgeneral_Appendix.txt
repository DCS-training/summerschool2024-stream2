   Climate.-That of Edinburgh is much drier; that of
Glasgow, moister; the town of Dumfries is warmer and
earlier.  Our climate is more fit for pasture than for crops; yet
an industrious farmer raises good crops, the soil favouring
him, which is kindly.  If the season be wet, our hill crops
are good; if dry, the low grounds succeed better.  There
was abundance here, even in the calamitous seasons of 1782
and I783.  West winds are prevalent, and they often bring
rain.  The south wind coming in from the sea, to the W. of
the Solway Frith, brings great rains.  Falls of snow, succeed-
ed by sudden thaws, or by alternate thaws and frosts, injure
the sheep stocks: and the injury is the greater, because the
pasture hills are bare of shelter; no large rocks to defend the
sheep; and the woods mostly in water courses, which are dan-
gerous under a thaw.  It is a thing, in course, to expect our
Lammas Flood.  Winds are seldom hurtful, unless they hap-
pen to catch the ripe corn on hill grounds.  A mildew,
sometimes, though not often, floats on the holms by Annan
side, and hurts the crops.  The 26th of Jan. 1794 brought a
heavy snow, which, in going off, did great damage to some
of our store farmers.  The greatest flood ever remembered
was in August 1797; yet it was local in a great degree, and
the damage less than one would have expected.  We consider
the climate to be salubrious; and the population tables, in some
degree, prove it so.  No climate can be fitter for the rearing
of all kinds of cattle; violent extremes of heat or cold not
being much known.
   The rising of high towering clouds from the sea in the south-
ern horizon, is a received sign of great rain.  A light coloured
vapoury cloud, hanging on the heights of Wamphray, on the
N. E. is the sign of wind.  Thin fleecy clouds, gathering in
the sky, (Virgil's 'tenuia vellera,') are thought to precede
rains; the same is observed with respect to parallel ranges of
