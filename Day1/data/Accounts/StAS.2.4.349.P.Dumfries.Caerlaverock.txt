		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name, Boundaries, &c.--ANTIQUARIES differ as to the import
of the name of this parish. Chalmers considers it to mean " the
castle with the rotundity or buttress jutting out," while, according
to Baxter, it signifies " the castle close upon the sea." It was an-

thography,--although at present it is as frequently written Carlave-
rock. The situation is entirely peninsular. Connected with Dum-
fries on the north-west, it stretches toward the English coast.
From this, it is separated by the Solway, which is here about twelve
miles in breadth. The Nith on the west, and Lochar on the east,
are the other boundaries. The Nith is generally fordable at low
water, and, in very low tides, people may wade across to the adja-
cent parish of New Abbey. But on the other side of the parish,
the extensive moss through which the Lochar flows, forms an in-
superable barrier to all communication, except during the driest
months of summer, and even then only to pedestrianr. The parish
of Caerlaverock is about 6 miles in length, and nowhere more
than 2 in breadth. It is in the form of an elongated hill, de-
scending gradually to the Nith on the one side, and the Lochar
on the other, and terminating in the Blackshaw flat towards the
Solway. About six miles are washed by the tide, which flows up
the Nith as far as Dumfries. The shore is a sandy mud, which
used formerly to be laid on the land as a substitute for lime. The
