     of Blair-Atholl and Strowan.

Dail-na-cardoch is the Dale of the Smith's Shop, or rather of
the Iron-work; Dail-na-mein, is the Plain of the Mineral.
Near these, and along the side of the hill, down to Blair, are
still to be seen the holes, wherein they melted the iron-ore.
At that time, the country was covered with wood of various
kinds, especially of Scots fir; the roots of which are still dug
up for fire-wood.
   A gun-shot above the church of Strowan, on the S.W. bank
of the Garry, is Tom-an-tich-mhoir, the Hill of the Great House,
a small square rising ground, partly artificial; and surrounded
with a ditch, or foss, said to have been raised by Allan Dirip,
one of the family of Keppoch.  In the church yard of Strow-
an, there is a large obelisk, on which a cross is cut.  At Pit-
agown, on the west side of the Bruir, is one large stone stand-
ing, and two or three lying by it, which probably formed a
Druidical temple.  On the Minigcog road, above Blair, is
Carn-inhic shims, ( vic himi ), or Lovat's Cairn, (properly the
Cairn of the Son of Simon, ) who came to plunder the coun-
try, and sell there.
   Atholl house being in good repair, and well furnished, not-
withstanding the high antiquity of great part of it, does not

fore, to observe, that, till the year 1747, or later, it was a-
bout three stories higher, than it is at present, and was fortifi-
ed with many Gothic turrets and battlements, mounted with
guns.

   Natural Curiosities,-To the east of Atholl-house, there is
a deep pool, with a rock in it, whence adultoresses were of
old thrown, fewed up in a fack, and drowned.  A little above
it, on the east bank, and opposite to a curious hermitage, on
the west bank, and in sight of the highway, is a pretty cascade.
On the west side of Beinn-glo, are Carn-torcy (torky) and
