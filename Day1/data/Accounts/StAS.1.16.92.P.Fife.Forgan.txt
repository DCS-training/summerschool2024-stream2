per boll.  Pease are by no means a lucrative crop, but they
serve to meliorate the ground when the crop is rank, and
the straw is excellent fodder for horses.  It is chiefly on
these accounts that the farmers continue to sow them, for
the price of pease is generally low, and their returns very
inconsiderable.  The soil is very much adapted to the cul-
ture of turnips; of there they raise good crops, with which,
during the winter, they feed their cows and cattle, some of
which they fatten for slaughter, and for which they some-
times draw good prices.  They have also good crops of
potatoes, from the light and dry soil.  These yield a salu-
tary support to the poor people, when they do not use them
to excess.  To this, however, they are strongly tempted,
when the meal is high priced.  On such occasions they feed
upon them thrice a day, by which their health is sometimes
hurt.  With the refuse, and the smaller potatoes, they com-
monly feed swine, which they salt up for winter provision.

   Rents.-Their rents are from L. 100 to L 400 per an-
num, and upwards.  The tenants are all in easy circum-
stances, and some of them are opulent.  All of them are
sober, active, and industrious.  Those of them that have
lately got new tacks pay double, and some almost triple
their old rents.  Several of the tenants have subset some
acres of their ground, lying at a distance from the farm
houses.  They who enjoy these small possessions are called
Pendiclers.  Some of them have 10 or 12 acres, some more,
some less.
