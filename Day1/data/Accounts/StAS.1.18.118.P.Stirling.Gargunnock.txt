     Statistical Account

   Roads.-The military road from Stirling to Dumbarton,
made betwixt 30 and 40 years ago, and which passes through
the centre of this parish, is now by Act of Parliament to have
a new line of direction, and to be made a turnpike road.  It
is hoped the trustees will confine the exercise of their power
to what is immediately useful and necessary.  Any alterations
in order to avoid heights, or to lessen the distance, where that
can be conveniently done, would be readily submitted to by
all, from the evident advantage resulting from them.  But,
if new lines of considerable length are proposed, where the
grounds must be purchased and re-inclosed; or, if the road
shall be so formed as to render plantations and improvements
useless, which have been carrying on for years in the faith
that the present line of road was to be permanent; if it shall
be so directed, as to abandon a number of thriving villages, or
so unnecessarily widened as to break in upon many beautiful
strips of planting, by which means a debt must be incurred
that can only be repaid by a heavy toll on the grain, the coal
and the lime, it is doubtful, whether the good or the evil of
such alterations would preponderate.  The trustees have no
interest but to act for the general advantage of the country,
and there is no reason to doubt that this will be the object of
their chief attention.

   Game, etc.-In this parish there are the heath-fowl, hares,
and partridges.
   The commencement of partridge shooting, as early as the
beginning of September, is very often a cause of their scarcity,
as the tenants are tempted to destroy the eggs for the sake of
the crops, which are sometimes much injured by the sports-
men and dogs.
   The cleft of Ballochleam is still remarkable for the hawks,
