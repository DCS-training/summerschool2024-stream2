     PARISH OF DOUGLAS.

     (County and Presbytery of Lanark-Synod of Glasgow and
     Air.)

     By the Rev. Mr. WILLIAM M'CUBBIN.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE account of it given by Mr. Hume of Godscroft, is,
that in the reign of Solvathius king of Scotland, about
the year 767, one Donald Bain (i. e. the white or fair), aspired
after the crown, gave the king battle, and had almost gained.
the victory, when a certain nobleman, with his sons and fol-
lowers, came to the king's aid, and behaved with such courage
and resolation, that Donald's army was defeated, and he him-
self slain.  The king, anxious to know to whom he was so
much indebted, and the nobleman being present, one of his
lieutenants, pointing to him with his finger, said, Sholto
Duglasse, i. e. "Behold yonder black grey man." Upon
which the king gave him much land, and the surname of
Douglas, which his posterity still retain; and from him too,
the parish, as well as the town, castle and river, derive their
names.  Others say, that the river Douglas, which runs
through the parish, gives name to the town and the noble
family to whom the parish belongs.  The name is doubtless
of Gaelic original, and signifies Black Water, which is an ex-
ceeding proper appellation for the river, as it is black, having
its source and all its supplies from a mossy country*.
