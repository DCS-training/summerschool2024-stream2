   School, &c.-From its natural healthiness, as well as
the easy access in all directions, Linlithgow is peculiarly
fitted for a place of education.  Many of both sexes have
been trained here.  That fewer now resort to it, may be
accounted for from the variety of new erections in that
line, and the ever-changing humour of the publick, with-

circumtance ought certainly to be attended to, as it is
improper to alienate to strangers funds destined for the
necessitous, who have a natural interest in the parish.  Nor
are the proper objects of charity those who often scroll about
from idleness, and waste what is given them; but the
