   The fishermen carry many articles of provision from their
own houses to the fishing stations, such as butter, milk, etc.
on which no value is here put.  Neither is any thing stated 
for insurance, which in this trade ought to be very high, as
the risk is great.

   The fishery is carried on in these open boats, at the di-
stance of 10 or 15 leagues from shore; and when bad wea-
ther overtakes them during the night, which is often the
case, the poor men are obliged to desert their lines, and make
for the shore, which, alas! in many instances they never
reach.  The present minister remembers two boats being lost
in one night, by which accident 10 widows and 53 fatherless 
children were left.

     Annual Expence, and Annual Returns.

   The fish is delivered to the proprietors, as caught, at 42 s.
per quintal.  At the principal fishing stations, each boat may
catch, at an average, 800 ling, which may weigh 100 quin-
tals, a little more or less.
