   Miscellaneous Observations.-What the state of the fisheries
once was, and how much they have declined, will appear
from the following facts, which are either taken from the
records, or related on undoubted authority.  The minister
drew the teinds (i.e. tythes) of fish, as part of his stipend;
the rown generally farmed them at the rate of ten, twelve,
or sometimes fifteen pounds a year.  For these last twenty
years they have never let for more than 13 s., and have been
sometimes so low as 5 s.  The late Mr Nairne, minister of
Anstruther-Easter, drew L. 55 per annum for the teinds of
the herring fishery alone; but his son the present minister
let them to the town for L. 22:4:5 Sterling.

   The town of Anstruther, and many others on this coast,
suffered much in the civil wars, in the reign of Charles I.
both by sea and land.  They were zealous covenanters, and
there are few old inhabitants of the parish, who do not talk
of some relations, that went to the battle of Kilsyth, in the
year 1645, and who were never afterwards heard of. In
this disaster, and in temporary failures of their fishing, An-
struther shared the fate of its neighbours, about the year
1670, by an inundation of the sea, which destroyed or
chocked up the harbour, washed away the bulwarks, and
rendered many of the houses unsafe to dwell in. An inun-
dation of a similar kind happened about the end of last cen-
tury; when about a third of the town seems to have been
destroyed.  A long street, called the sore street, was totally
destroyed; scarce a vestige of it now remains.  The rock on
which the town house once stood, is covered by the sea
every spring tide, and every tide the sea washed the street,
where the principal houses of the borough were situated.
