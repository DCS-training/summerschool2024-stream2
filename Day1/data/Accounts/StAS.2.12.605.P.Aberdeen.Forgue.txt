quarter of a mile from the church.  In 1715, the parish minister,
who was very popular and much asteemed by the people, was de-
posed by the General Assembly for the part he took in favour of
the Pretender.  This gave great offence to the parishioners, and
induced many of them to leave the church and join the Episcopa-
lians.  Hence Forgue has long been a Stronghold of Episcopacy.
The Connection, however, it would appear, is not gainig ground.
as, at the time of the last Statistical report, according to Mr Ding-
wall, the Episcopalians amounted, within the parish, to 220,
whereas they now amount to about 180.
   There is no Catholic chapel in the parish, and only three or
four individuals of that persuasion in it.  The other Dissenters
may amount to about 40.  The number of families in connection
with the Church is about 464; do. of persons, about 2200.  The
average number of communicants for the last six years is about
920.  146 families are within two miles of the church; 212 fami-
lies are more than four miles; 64 families are more than six miles;
and 92 families or so are still farther, distant,-some upwards of
eight miles.  The above statistics are given from my own census
taken in 1835.
   Ecclesiastical History.-Stipend at different timesL: Previous
to 1731, the stipend was 800 merks Scots in victual and money,
with L.20 Scots in addition for communion elements.  It appears
by the presbytery record, that, in 1731, an augmentation of 100
merks Scots of stipend, and 20 merks Scots of element-money
was given unanimously by the heritors, which was paid partly in
money and partly in victual.  The victual consisted of 44 bolls of
meal, and 20 bolls of bear, and was valued, as it had been by the
Comissioners of Tithes both in 1617 and 1633, at 100 merks per
chalder, or about 6s. 8d.  Sterling per boll.  Hence it would ap-
pear that the price of victual had continued stationary fvom 1617
1731, a period of 114 years.  The stipend and element-money
was by this augmentation made up to 950 merks Scots, and was
paid from the great teinds (parsonage), and the small (vicarage).
in the following proportions, namely, 550 merks from the great,
and 400 from the small, or vicarage-teinds.  This shows the re-
lative value of the parsonage to the vicarage-tends to have been
at that period, as 550 to 400, or exactly as 5 1/2 to 4.  It shows,
farther, on the supposition that both the parsonage-teinds and the
vicarage improved afterwards, pari passu, that in all future aug-
mentions, for every I.5, 10s. paid by the parsonage, L.4 ought
