not exceed L. 1 Sterling per annum.  The great concern of the
farmer, or any other head of a family here, is to provide
provisions, cloathing, bedding, etc. for his herds, milk-
maids, etc.  The dearness of these several articles, together
with the expence and trouble of carriage, mentioned above,
is the reason why the fees of domestic servants cannot be
so high in this as in corn-parishes.  Of old times, and at
this very day, there is a proverb used in the Highlands,
which, when translated, expresses literally, That it is
for decent food and accommodation, and not for wages,
they (domestic servants) serve.  Labour by the day is ac-
counted high, being 8 d. 10 d. etc.; and therewith they
are fed thrice a-day.  The reason why day labourers are
so high in their demand, is, that all those not serving in fa-
milies always resort to the numerous fishing-vessels on the
coast, where men well skilled in packing, may gain at
least 2 s. per day; strong old women, and industrious lasses,
1 s. 6 d. per day, by gutting the herrings.

   Caves and Pigeons.-There is a very large one in Lofty-
su-il-vine, another at Knockan; also a very spacious one at
Cul-kin-ach-na-karnan, Go-an-dun-an*, otherwise called,
Go-na-kal-man.  This cave is no great distance from the
point or land-end of Row-store.  Besides these there are ma-
ny more; to such, and to the clefts of rocks, the pigeons
resort to hatch and for shelter.  There are no other dove-
cotes here.

*Go-an-dun-an, called so by reason of its being near the remains of a
dune, built by Scandinavians, when upon their being defeat near Dor-
noch, and in the adjacent parts of the county of Ross.  To that place they
resorted, and built a dune.  Then they burned the large fir-forests of
Assint, etc. Go-na-kal-man, i.e. the Pigeon-cove.  The Scandinavians ha-
ving built a large hire-lin or ship, they went to their own country.
