hill is about 500 yards from the level of the country.  At
the foot of it, immediately south of the castle, there is an ap-
pearance of a crater of a volcano, and all around something
that resembles lava.

   Rivers.-The river Esk runs through the parish; and, it
is thought, might easily be made navigable from the Kirk-
town of Tannadice to Montrole, about 12 miles distant.  In
its present state, it runs in a serpentine direction through a
very fertile country.  Formerly it abounded with salmon;
but, on account of the number of crubs, there are now few
or none.  The rivulet called Lemno has lately been turned
into a canal, which runs the whole length of the parish, from
east to west, and bisects it.  It might easily be made navigable
for small boats.  It joins the river Esk below the old castle
of Finhaven.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants in this parish is
believed to have been nearly the same for several years past.
