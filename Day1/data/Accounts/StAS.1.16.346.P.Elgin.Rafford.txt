By his unremitting attention to the morals as well as profi-
ciency of his pupils, during a period of more than 40
years, the present teacher has acquired a just degree of ce-
lebrity.  Many characters now respectable in the literary,
the commercial, the civil, and military departments, among
others the learned Rector of the High School of Edin-
burgh, who is a native, received their classical education
here.

   Obelisk.-The only piece of antiquity worthy of remark,
is the standing pillar near Tarres, commonly called Sueno's
Stone.  It is allowed by all journalists who have viewed it,
to surpass, in elegance and grandeur, all the other obelisks
in Scotland, and is said to be the finest monument of the
Gothic kind to be seen in Europe.  Some time ago, when
it was like to fall, Lady Anne Campbell, late Countess of
Moray, caused it to be set upright, and supported with se-
veral steps of freestone.  The height of this stone cannot
now be easily ascertained; it rises about 23 feet above
ground, and is said to be 12 under it.  Its breadth is about
4 feet.  What is above ground is visibly divided, on the
east side, into seven parts, containing a variety of military
sculptures.  The greatest part of the other side is occupied
by a sumptuous cross, under which are two august person-
ages in an attitude of reconciliation.
