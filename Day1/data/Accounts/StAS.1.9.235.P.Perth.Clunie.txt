wren, the lapwing, the swallow and martin, the stone-chat-
ter, the cuckoo and tit-lark, the fieldfare and snow-flight, and
sometimes, as in November 1791, the Bohemian chatterer
and butcher-bird.  The sandy-lark haunts our lochs in sum-
mer, and great number of sea mews, pitarnies and gulls,
come up in the spring.  The aquatic fowls of the country
abound here; we have the wild-duck, the widgeon, the
smaller and larger teal, and the water rail.  The wild-
geese rest here, though rarely, on their passage; and like-
wise the wild swans, (perhaps 12 or 18 of them together),
in their way to or from Loch Spynie near Elgin, their great
place of rendezvous; a few of them generally remain on
the Stormont lochs all the summer.  The cormorant, here
called the scart, frequents the island in the loch of Clunie,
and sometimes the osprey, but neither has been known to
build there.  The herons used to hatch in numbers on the
trees of the island, but not since the late reparation of the
castle.  Of the sucker-birds, the snipe nestles here, the
woodcock comes in October, and departs in February or
March; and the curlew visits us in spring and autumn.
We have plenty of the grey plover, and common grouse in
our moors, and the black-cock begins to make his appear-
ance among our plantations.  The partridge nestles in al-
most every clover field, where, sometimes the poor dam,
while the sits on 18 or perhaps 24 eggs, has her head cut
off by the scythe; a disaster the more to be regretted, as it
cannot be prevented unless her nest be discovered and mark-
ed before the hay-cutting begins.  The pheasant was com-
mon here some years ago, being introduced at Dunkeld by
the Athole family.  It became so tame, as frequently to
join the domestic fowls in the barn yard, and often there its
tameness proved fatal to it.  It was also a good mark, and
an easy prey to the poacher, and in spring its eggs being
deposited rather carelessly, were, before hatching, eaten
