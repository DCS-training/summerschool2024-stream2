and completely remove their prejudices; especially as the
practice of inoculation has, within these few years, become
general in the village of Catrine.  In this parish, one man
has, from his infancy, been dumb, deaf, and blind; two men
are blind from age, and two women in consequence of the
small-pox.

   Longevity.-A considerable number of both sexes arrive
at 80 years of age, and some even exceed 90.  Within a
very small distance of the church, there are just now living
a shoemaker in the 90th year of his age, and who still occupies
the house in which he was born; the church-officer, who is
in his 85th year; a gardener in his 95th, and his wife, near
ly of the same age*; also the possessor of a small farm, who
is now in his 97th year.  The last of these is the most vi-
gorous of them all, and walks 2 or 3 miles every day.  It
is not a little remarkable, that all these aged persons, ex-
cept the first, were servants to the late Countess-dowager of
Loudon, who herself lived, at Sorn Castle, till within 3 or
4 months of her 100th year.

   State of Property.-The valued rent of this parish is
L. 5416 Scotch; and the real rent, including that of the
lands occupied by the proprietors, may amount to about
L. 4000 Sterling.  This property is divided among no less
than 27 heritors.  Of these, Mr Tennent of Sorn, the most
considerable proprietor, resides occasionally; Mr Gray of
Gilmillscroft, Mr Campbell of Auchmonnach, and 10 small
proprietors, reside constantly; the rest do not reside at all.
The non-residing heritors, arranged in the order of their re-
spective valuations, are the following, viz.
