and price, must be produced to the session, before more 
money is advanced.

   School, etc.-The school-master's salary is 100 merks Scots,
(L. 8:6:8 sterling,) paid partly by the heritors, and partly
by the tenants.  He has also 20 s. as precentor and session-
clerk.  His perquisites and school fees through year, will
not exceed 20 s. more.  No person qualified for the instruc-
tion of youth, can be supported to subsist on such a pittance,
while an ordinary plowman, or barnman, can make at the rate
of L. 14 or L. 15 a year.-The want of proper school-
masters is the principal cause of the ignorance, bigotry, and
sectarism, which now prevail in many parts of this country.
In former times, the commons of Scotland were justy accoun-
ted the most enlightened people of their station in Europe; but
they will probably soon cease to deserve that honourable dis-
tinction, if the plans, which are now in agitation, for addi-
tional couragement to schood masters, are treated with neglect.
It is only from the well informed, and well educated part of the
community, that candour, moderation, rational piety, and
decency of manners can be expected.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-No new honse or cottage has
been built in the parish for these ten years past.  About 6
have fallen down, the inhabitants having emigrated to Edin-
burgh or elsewhere.-The wages of a male servant is about 
L. 15, if he lives in his own house, or L. 8, and his maintain-
ance, if he resides with his master.  Maid-servants wages are
about L. 3, and their maintenance.  The circumstances of
the lower orders of the community, in this neighbourhood, if
they are industrious, are, on the whole, easy.  But indolence
or vice, clothes a man with rags, in this as well as in order
countries.
