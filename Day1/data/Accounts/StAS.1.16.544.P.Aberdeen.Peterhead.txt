     Statistical Account

   The ground in the parish rises gradually from the sea to
the westward, nearly to the extremity of the parish in most
places.  The only eminence that can be called a hill, is
the Stirling Hill, which separates this parish on the S. from
the parish of Cruden.  The highest part of this hill is scarce-
ly 200 feet above the level of the sea.  In time of war,
persons often resort there to observe if any ships are on the
coast; it is seen at a considerable distance at sea, and was
of great service to the fishers on this coast as a land-mark,
before they carried a compass in their boats, which is only
a late precaution, and still not generally used.

   Bays.-There are two bays in the parish, the bays of
Peterhead and Invernettie.  The bay of Peterhead is formed
by the town and neck of land, which projects betwixt it
and the sea on the N.; this promontory is called Chalk
Inch, Keith Inch, and Greenhill, is unquestionably the
eastermost point in Scotland, and ought to be called Bu-
channess.  The bay is terminated on the S. by the lands of
Invernettie, terminating in a point called Satie's Head.  The
other bay is formed from this point on the N. and part of
the lands of Boddorm, the termination of the Stirling Hill
on the S.; this point is called Boddom-head; but in charts,
and by most strangers, is slyled the Buchanness.  The di-
stance from Boddorn-head to the eastermost point of Keith
Inch, is about 3 miles; and a line drawn through these two
points is considerably to the eastward of Satie's Head,
which divides these two bays.  The shore on the south side
of the parish is rocky and high; at the head of each
bay there is a sandy beach.  In the bay near to Boddom-
bead, there is a small rock about half a mile, or a little
more, from the land, called ? ? in maps denominated
Craig Hurlie, where people often go to gather dilse, where
some sea-fowl resort and where the free masons of this
