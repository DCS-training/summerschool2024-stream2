   Potatoes.-In 1788, Dr. JAMES ANDERSON, in the Memoirs
of the Society for Encouraging Agriculture, etc. gives the fol-
lowing important facts respecting this valuable esculent root,
and which ought not to be omitted, as they may be of use to
the practical farmer, especially in the remote parts of the
kingdom; viz.
   1st, It is found, from actual experiment, that it is a matter
of indifference, whether the potatoes, employed as sets, be
whole, or cut in pieces, provided the sets be of the same size;
but that a variation of the size planted, always affects the
amount of the crop in a remarkable degree.  The larger sets,
in all cases, produce the greater crop.
   2dly, If the stems of potatoes be cut over, while they are
green, and succulent, the increase of bulbs, from that moment,
is stopt, and the crop by this means greatly diminished.
   3dly, Potatoes advance much more, after the time they are
usually thought to have attained their maturity, than is in
general suspected.
   The following table shews the weight of the produce of six
stems, taken up at periods of one week intervening between
each.
