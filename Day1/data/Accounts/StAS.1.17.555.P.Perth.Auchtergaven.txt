   Heritors.-His Grace the Duke of Atholl, the Earl of
Mansfield, George Stewart, Esq; of Grandtully, and Robert
Robertson, Esq; of Tullybelton, are the heritors of this
parish.
   The barony of Tullybeagles included, as before mention-
ed in this Statistical Account, belongs to the family of Aldie.
The valued rent of the parish is about 5,000 l. Scotch money.
None of the heritors reside at present in the parish.

   Improvements in Agriculture, etc.-The progress of im-
provements in agriculture, in the manufactures, roads, and
buildings here, has been so rapid within there ten years past
that the country has assumed quite a different aspect from
what it had before that time.  Though good crops of oats,
barley, and flax, were long ago raised upon particular spots of
ground, yet, till the year 1784, or 1785 there were not
above three or four farms upon a regular plan, and very few
neat farm steadings in the parish.  The public road from
Perth to Dunkeld passed through a large plantation of Scotch.
firs, and then along a track of bleak, wet, muir ground, which
tended to impress travellers with a very unfavourable opinion
of the adjacent country.
   At present, there are from 20 to 30 regular farms, from
80 to 200 acres each; ands upon all of them, neat elegant
houses and offices covered with slate.  The farmers find is
their interest to adopt, in the management of their ground,
the method recommended by the proprietors, of summer fal-
lowing, and mixing, alternately, white and green crops.  Till
lately, a field of wheat was seldom to be seen here, now, se-
veral of the farmers low from 10 to 20 bolls of wheat yearly,
and have excellent crops.  To encourage them in raising
this useful grain, the Duke of Atholl has erected a flour
mill upon his estate in this parish.
