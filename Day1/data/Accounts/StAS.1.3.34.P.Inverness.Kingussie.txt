     NUMBER III.

     UNITED PARISHES OF KINGUSSIE AND INCH.

     (County of Inverness.)

     By the Rev. Mr J. ANDERSON.

     Name, Extent, and Situation.

   From the name of this parish, which, in its literal ac-
ceptation, signifies+ "the Head of the Firewood," it
seems evident that a large tract of the lands adjacent to the
church had been formerly covered with fir trees; though at
present there is not a single tree of this kind within some
miles of it; and the country in general, owing to scarcity
of planted wood, has, to the eye of a traveller, a bleak and
naked appearance.

   The extent of the parish from east to west, is nearly 17
miles, and from north to south upwards of 20; but of this
only the low part and the glens along the rivers are well in-
habited, the rest being in general a range of hills appropri-
ated to pasturage, where but a few hamlets are thinly scatter-
ed, for the accomodation of those who attend their cattle
during the summer months.  It is bounded by the parish of
Laggan to the west, the united parishes of Moy and Dala-
rossie to the north, Alvie to the east, and Blair in Athol to
the south.
