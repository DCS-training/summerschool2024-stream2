   The smithy is an altered coal, and along with its accompanying
splint seems to be the same as is found at Kirkmuirhill, in the pa-
rish of Lesmahago.  From the undermost coals only being found
here, it appears that the great carboniferous group is beginning
to crop out, and that in due time it will gradually wear out and merge
into the calciferous deposits found a little to the south-east, in the
parish of Carnwath.  The distance from the limestone in most
parts of the parish is, however, very great, and, if calculated from
the lowest coal alone, includes a succession of 147 different strata.
The succession of the strata at Curry side, near Shotts Ironworks,
is as follows:

   The Lady Anne coal, as already mentioned, is a splint coal.
The first Shotts coal is known in the west end of the parish by
the name of the Cleland Wee coal.  It has a stratum of balls and
a band of ironstone above it.  This is a soft coal, and, being en-
tirely free of sulphur, is of excellent quality for making iron.  The
second coal is chiefly used for house fires.  The Shotts smithy
coal, from eight to nine fathoms below the Shotts second coal, is
apparently only apartial deposit, but where found, if of good quality is
one of the most valuable coals in Scotland.  It averages from about
twenty-fout, to thirty inches thick, and is always best when found
near to the igneous or dolerite rocks.  In this condition, it is known
to extend all over the glebe.  It is at present wrought on the Duke
of Hamilton's lands, and to the north of the glebe, in a pit about
fifteen fathoms deep, in which there is an engine to lift the water,
and the coals to surface.  This, like the Shotts first coal, is
wrought by room and rance.
