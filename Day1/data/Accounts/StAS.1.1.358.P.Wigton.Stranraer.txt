Dunlop.  Contigous to this village is a very safe and com-
modious bay, with good anchoring ground, and depth of wa-
ter sufficient for ships of any burden; and all vessels entering
into, or coming out of the Frith of Clyde fly to it for shelter
from storms.  King William's fleet anchored here in their
passage to Ireland.  Opposite to the village of Cairn, in the
Kirkholm side, a sand bank, called the Scar, runs a consider-
able way cross the loch from N. W. to S. E.  To prevent
their running soul of this bank, vessels keep pretty near the
east shore.  Few accidents have ever happened in this bank.
It even contributes considerably to the safety of the southern
part of the bay, breaking the force of the tide by direc-

most excellent flavour.  They are found indeed all round
the shores, and might be got in great quantities would people
drag for them.  At present they are only gathered at low
water, in spring sides, for a few months in the spring.  Loch-
ryan immediately spreads out, on both sides, into a very beau-
tiful circular figure, extending about four miles in breadth.
Besides the Cairn Bay, there are several other good anchor-
ing bays in the loch; such as Portmore Bay, a little within
the loch on the west side; the Wig, just on the west side of 
the of the same name, about two miles fourth of the Scar;
and the Bay  of Dalmennock on the east side, about two miles
above the Cairn.  In short, the anchoring ground is good, and
safe every where through the whole loch.  A variety of fish, as
skate, slounders, small cod, haddocks, whitings, lobsters and
crabs, and sometimes turbot, are caught within the loch.  Be-
tween the mouth of the loch and the Rock of Ailfa, and to
the west of Millar Point, along the shores of Kirkholm, the
cods and haddocks are larger, and of a most excellent quali-
ty.  But these fishing grounds, lying at 12 or 15 miles from
