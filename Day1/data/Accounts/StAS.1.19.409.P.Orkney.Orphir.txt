ware.  Very good marl has been discovered, but little use
has been made of it.  There can hardly be said to be any
rotation of crops, the same fields having been sown, for
time immemorial, with bear and cats alternately, and sel-
dom yield above 3 or 4 of increase.  The grain of this pa-
rish is esteemed to be of a superior quality, and the best
malt in Orkney is made here.  The bear raised from fea-
ware is observed to be husky, and small bodied.  Pease
thrive very well; but, except a few for the table, little at-
tention is paid to them.  Cabbages and garden roots grow
in great perfection; and perhaps the finest and largest arti-
chokes in the world are to be found in this country, in the
common kail-yards, springing up amongst the grass with-
out any cultivation.

   Woods.-There are a few currant or berry bushes, and a
few apple trees, trained up along the garden-walls; but no
forest trees ever have been, or perhaps ever will be, raised
in this country.  The atmosphere is evidently too much
impregnated with salt-water; for, in stormy weather, the
sea-spray flies over the whole country, and frequently ruins
the crop, particularly if it happens in the first of August,
before the corn is greenful.  There are a few natural bazles,
mountain-ash, and willows, in one of the vallies of the hill
of Hoy; and although these, owing to the winding of the
valley, and the height of the surrounding hills, are remark-
ably well sheltered, yet they do not exceed 12 or 14 feet
in height.  A great many roots or small trees, seemingly
such as these, are also dug up in several peat-mosses; but it
does not appear that there have ever been trees of any size
in this country; and this fact is incontrovertibly established
by the Icelandick historians, who relate, that Einar, Earl
of Orkney, about the end of the ninth century, "Dictum
