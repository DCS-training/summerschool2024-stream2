family for its own consumption.  They are generally set af-
ter the plough, but hand-hoed.  The little time that can be
spared from other work, causes a smaller quantity to be cul-

   There being no limestone here, or in the vicinity, and
very little sea-ware got for manure, and even that of the
worst kind; the common manure is the dung of the 
cattle, mixed with ashes and dry seal in the bytes, which
is carried to the dunghill, and laid in alternate rows with
mossy turf.  To increase the quantity of ashes, turf pa-
red from the moors, where there is some mixture of peat
moss with grit or clays, is burnt for fuel in the houses.
with a few peats. * Marl of different kinds is found in
both parishes, but little of it used for manure, owing to
the difficulty of taking it up rainy seasons, and perhaps
still more so to the little time many of the people can
spare from working, and leading their masters peats, and
partly to their ignorance of its value as a manure.  Very
few of the farms exceed 12 or 13 acres of arable
land.  A farm of 16 or 18 acres is considered as a great
one; and many of them are from 8 to 5.  The rents va-
ry considerably, according to the quality of the land, the
opportunity of rearing cattle, making butter, and other
local circumstances.  In 2 or 3 instances, the rent is near-
ly 20 s.  the acre; but, in general, even good land does
not exceed 10 s. or 12 s., and in many places is far below
that rent+.

*In digging up marl in Stenness, flags horns and bones are sometimes
found.  An instance of this occurred last summer, and another about 4
years ago.
