part of the rest, had the good fortune to fall under the phy-
sicians care, and all of them learned his cool regimen. (A
young gentlemen in the neighbourhood inoculated above 200
there, and did not lose one).  There are still about 250 in this
parish who would not submit to inoculation, and had the
good luck to escape the infection.  The small-pox spread
over about half the parish in 1740; and it appears, from a
register of deaths at that time, that there died 78.  About 40
years ago, they were in a small corner of the parish, especi-
ally about Cullswick; there are at least a third more inhabi-
tants there now, than were then, and there died 17 in that
place, 11 of which were buried in one week, In 1791 there
were 58 inoculated in Cullswick, and not one died.
   A number of young men from this parish go to sea.  Some-
times they engage with the Greenland ships for the season,
and are landed again in the autumn.  Their wages are high
but they learn many bad habits, and seldom put their money to
good use.  Many of them bind apprentices to Greenland, and
other ships, and make fine hardy seamen.  During the Ame-
rican war four men enlisted for soldiers,  which is very un-
common here.  The country, in general, agreed with go-
vernment for a certain number of men during the war, for
which they got protections to fishers from being impressed.
Of there 20 went from this parish, and only eight returned,
or are alive.
