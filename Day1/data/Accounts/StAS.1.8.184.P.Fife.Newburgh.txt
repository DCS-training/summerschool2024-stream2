burghal heritors of Newburgh, bears evident marks of im-
provement.

   Rent, Proprietors, etc.-The valued rent of the parish
amounts only to 1908 L. 17 s 6 d. Scotch.  Its real rent may not
at present be great; but, on the expiration of some leases, it must
rise considerably, as land, in the lower grounds, on the east of
Newburgh, lets, at from 2 L. to 3 L. per acre; and, in the higher
grounds, at from 10 s to 2 L. per acre.  The territory of the
parish is divided among two greater, and about 30 smaller
proprietors, called here, as well as in other parts of the coun-

proprietors, usually reside in it.  Besides the four farmers
already mentioned, there are few tenants in the parish, who
do not reside in the town, or at the shore of Newburgh; and
their number is not great, nor their portions of land extensive.

each; the other tenants pay much below that sum.

wheat, beans, and a mixture of beans and pease.  Notwith-
standing the richness of the soil in the lower grounds, it is not

wheat has been sown, not only in the lower grounds, but al-
so in the hilly parts of the parish.  As turnips are not found
profitable crop in clay lands, they are not cultivated in the
lands attached to the Abbey of Lindores.  Any trials made
to raise them in the higher grounds, have succeeded.  But it
is matter of regret, that farmers, in this part of the country,
shew some backwardness, in extending a species of crop, which,
when properly conducted, not only meliorates the land, and gives
it fresh life and vigour, but also furnishes a delicate and nonrish-
