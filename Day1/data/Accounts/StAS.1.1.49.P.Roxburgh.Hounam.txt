     Of Hounam.

be called a hilly or mountainous district; but the hills are
green, and rarely incumbered with rocks or covered with
heath.  The land is wet and spungy; the soil light, and
better calculated for grass than grain.  The air is healthy,
and the people long lived.  Three persons who had resided
in the parish from their youth, died lately, at the advanced age
of 100.

   Sheep.-The principal circumstance for which this district
is remarkable, is the Kale-water breed of sheep, so called from
a small stream running through the middle of the parish.  The
sheep are of a moderate size, and produce excellent wool.  Their
number usually amounts to 18,000.  Attempts have been made
to improve the breed, by crossing with a larger kind, but the
experiments did not succeed.  Though the sheep became lar-
ger, and the quantity of the wool was  increased, its quality
was inferior.  The most approved stock-farmers, however,
have not the leaft doubt that the wool might be brought to
still greater perfection by proper management, and by crossing
with sheep nearly of the same size, but whose wool is the
finest possible.  The sheep not only produce excellent wool,
but, as the farmers term it, they feed well, come to a tolerable
good size when fat, and are exquisite mutton.

   Productions.-The quantity of grain produced is very in-
considerable.  Several of the farms in the higher part of the
parish have scarcely been ploughed in the memory of man.
The soil being light and sandy, excellent turnips might be
raised.  Some have been produced in the parish weighing
above 26 lbs. avoirdupoise.  But the farmers have not as yet
succeeded in raising this useful root, thought they are extreme-
ly sensible of the great advantage that might be derived from
