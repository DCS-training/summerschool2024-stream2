number of sheep, cows, and horses, on the hill or common
pasture.  This little republic was governed by a birley
court, in which every proprietor of as freedom had a vote.
If the proprietor resided not in the place, his tenant voted
for him.  The great business of the court was to determine
which the respective proprietors should keep on the common

fields, as they threw it out of their byres; and, if they
found any man more industrious than themselves, that was

which is at no great distance, they never thought of driving.
With the natural, I had almost said with the spontaneous

of our present farmers!  Hence I conclude, that in order to
excite industry in a country, something more is necessary
than that every man have his house and his field.  It is ne-

barbarians, be banished, and a spirit of ambition and inter-
prise be introduced.  There is still great want of industry
in our village; yet the old people speak of the easy life of
former times, as making the most striking difference be-
tween them and the present.  Since the division of the
town, cultivation is mended.  There are now more stone
