is sometimes impassable even with boats.-The inhabitants 
of this parish are in general a peaceable, social, hospitable,
obliging, humane and well disposed people.  Many of the 
principal farmers, not to speak of heritors, besides all the 
qualities mentioned, possess a measure of information and 
politenes, which render them agreeable companions to men
of superior rank and education.  It is remarkable, that even
the most idle, dissipated, and worthless part of the inhabi-
tants, are not destitute of all those good qualities which dis-
tinguish the rest.  Scarcely any of them, for a long period, 
have been convicted of capital crimes, though there are a 
few, especially in the village, who are said to be addicted to 
fraud, pilsering, lying, evil speaking, and several other im-
moralities.-The number of sheep, (besides a few goats), is
about 13,000, of black cattle about 1650, of horses about
140, of carts about 40, and of ploughs about 40.  The me-
thod of managing sheep and black cattle in this part of the 
country, is fully described by Mr Anthony McMillan of 
this parish, in the 2d part of his Treatise on Pasturage, and
Essay annexed.  The same author has published also seve-
ral Treatises on Law and Forms of Writs.
