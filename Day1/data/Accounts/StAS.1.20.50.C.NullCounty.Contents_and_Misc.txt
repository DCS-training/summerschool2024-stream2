<APPENDIX>

Clergy in particular, to return to England, leaving that Work in an unfi-
nished state; and as the press is actually stopped for want of copy, I beg
that you would have the goodness to send me, in course, the Statistical Ac-
count of your parish, which, I am persuaded, must be ready before this
time.  I remain, with esteem, Sir, your faithful and obedient servant,

     JOHN SINCLAIR.

     EDINBURGH,
     2d Sep. 1795.

   N.B.  I will trouble you to acknowledge the receipt of this letter, in
course, even if it were not in your power to send the Account for a fort-
night or three weeks to come.  It is so essential to have the Work done
without any further delay, that I shall be under the disagreeable necessity,
of sending a Statistical Missionary, to every parish, from which I cannot pro
cure a return in the course of this month.

     No XI.  Circular Letter, sent in January 1796.

   SIR,

   However much occupied with other business, yet my anxiety conti-
nues unabated, for having the Statistical Account of Scotland com-
pleted, without delay; and I hope that the Account of your parish, is in
such a state of forwardness, that you can transmit it to me, in the course,
either of this, or the ensuing month of February.  It is of real importance
to have this Work brought to a conclusion, as it hampers all my other un-
dertakings.  I remain, with esteem, Sir, your faithful and obedient  ser-
vant,

     JOHN SINCLAIR.

     WHITEHALL,
     January 1796.

     No. XII.  Circular Letter to the deficient Clergy, 23d January 1796.

     SIR,

   At the commencement of a new year, it is natural for a person, anxious
to fulfill the duties of the station in which he is placed, to revolve in
his mind, the mistakes, the errors, and the omissions of the former.
