       			 PARISH OF STRICKATHROW.

		PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--THIS parish orginally consisted of two distinct parishes.
Strickathrow and Dunlappie, which werw united in 1612. Ac-
cording to a recent writer, * Strickathrow or Rtracathro, (Strath-
cath-ra,) signifies either "the Battle in the Strath," or " the
Valley of the Forts;" and is supposed to have been so called from
a battle which was fought in its neighbourhood, not far from the
celebrated hills Cater-thun, in 1130, between King David and
Angus Earl of Moray, grandson of Lulach, the son of Gruoch,
grand-daughter of Kenneth IV. The name, which is evidently a
Celtic compound, signifies according to others, the " srath or
valley where the King fought."
