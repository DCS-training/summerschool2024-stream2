advantages, and one of the most remarkable of these is the encou-
ragement of virtuous and industrious habits, arising out of the ha-
bitual sentiments of self-respect and self-dependence. This is no
imaginary statement; its effects have been manifested in the re-
markable fact, that, with the increase of trade and manufactures,
a rapidly multiplying population, and in an extensive district of
country, within a few miles of Glasgow, no poor's rate was ever,
imposed by law, till within these few years past: all was done by
voluntary contributions. This fact of itself speaks volumes in be-
half of the orderly, industrious, and virtuous habits of the people
of Kirkintilloch.

  When the last statistical account of the parish was drawn up,
there were-weavers, 185 ; stockingmakers, 11 ; smiths, 15;
house-carpenters and cabinet-makers, 20 ; masons, 10 ; shoe-
makers, 10; saddlers, 4; coopers, 6; a good many tailors, and a
few hair-dressers. At that period, namely, 1791, there were in
the burgh 1536; but in 1828, when the total population was 5518,
there were in the burgh 4172. The following is the state of the
principal trades at present, as drawn up by Mr William Moffat,
preacher of the Gospel: Slaters, 5; masons, 12; house-carpen-
ters and cabinet-makers, 30; tailors, 20; bakers, 12; shoemakers,
24; blacksmiths and locksmiths, 10; house-painters and glaziers,
4; hair-dressers, 2; saddlers, 2; weavers, 2000.
  It will be observed, that there is a decrease in the stocking-
making trade, also among the saddlers and coopers, and an as-
tonishing increase among the weavers. Some of these articles are
probably supplied from Glasgow. In the Church Extension list
I also find the following heads of families, namely, 7 founders
10 printers in cloth, 13 sailors, 5 maltmen, 20 merchants and
grocers, 7 carters, 2 plasterers, 2 thatchers, 2 quarriers, 1 mill-
