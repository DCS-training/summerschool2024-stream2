     the parish are composed, is the universal clayslate, or dark-blue
     flagstone of the county.  This, when the stones are well selected,
     and squared, makes a beautiful wall.  Buildings of it, however
     from the darkness of its hue, have a very sombre appearance'
       Many houses in Pulteneytown, and throughout the landward
     part of the parish, are built without lime. The wind sifts through
     their walls,  and makes them very cold. The houses of many of
     the smaller tenants, and of the cottars, are built partly of stone
     and partly of turf.  Some of them are of turf altogether, and are
     wretched hovels.  But these very miserable huts are happily be-
     coming rare in the parish of Wick.

        It is impossible to ascertain the yearly average of births, mar-
     riages, and deaths, seeing that there is no register of deaths; that
     the Dissenters do not register t1feir children's births ; that great
     numbers of Churchmen are guilty of the same culpable negligence;
     and that a register of marriages solemnized within the Establish-
     ment, was commenced only about four months ago.
