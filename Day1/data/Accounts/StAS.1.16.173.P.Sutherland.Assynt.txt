course from Kirk-ag river to the point of Row-store, runs
from S. S. E. to N. N. W.  All this coast is importance,
as the sea abounds with every species of fish, cod, ling, etc.
there are likewise a variety of shell fish, viz. oyster, lobster,
etc.  But the annual resort of herring to this and neigh-
bouring coasts, S. and N. of the parish, (now for several
years past), is what affords great advantage, both in respect
of living and profit to those residing there, far superior to
all the resources which the inhabitants residing on the
heights of it can have.  By the side of Loch-Inver is the
fishing station of Culag, built at the expence of L 2000
Sterling, by John Joseph Bacon, Esq; of the Isle of Man,
and one Mr Donald Ross partner, for a certain share of that
sum.  Of late years the lease and buildings have been all
transferred to other adventurers.  There is a small cruive
on the little river of Culag, where perhaps a barrel of sal-
mon may be catched throughout the season; its contiguity
to the salmon-fishing of Inver river can be the only season
for the expence of its having a cruive and small chest across.
   At Inver river, which has also cruive and two chests,
there may be cured throughout the season two lasts of sal-
mon; a favourable year may produce more, but very sel-
dom, if ever, does it complete three lasts.  Inver river,

tion, especially from Goin-vaul-hill, and also from Loch-
Ah, near Ledbeg farm, on the height of this parish, it
disgorges itself into the large and very safe harbour, of Loch-
Inver, where, when the herring-fishing offers successfully,
there may be seen occasionally two, three, or four score,

the coast.
