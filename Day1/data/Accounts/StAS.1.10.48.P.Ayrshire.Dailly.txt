number of children produced, at an average, from each mar-
riage, is nearly 4 1/3.
   In the calculations offered above of the probable amount
of population at different periods, it was supposed, as usual,
that the annual averages of births and of deaths were, to the
total number of inhabitants, respectively, as 1 to 26 and to
36.  On a comparison, however, of the annual numbers of
births and deaths from the year 1781 to the year 1790, with
the actual state of population in the year 1791, the respective
proportions appear, during that period, to have been as I
to 29.6 and to 47.6.  Of course, the number of births is
to that of deaths as 47.6 to 29.6; or nearly as 5 to 3.  The
proportion between the annual marriages and the whole po-
pulation is nearly as 1 to 160.
   By far the greater number of the present inhabitants have
been born and educated in the parish.  Almost the whole
are Scotch, with exception of a few Irish, whom the rising
wages of labour have of late induced to settle in the parish.
The number of settlers, from other parts of Scotland and
from Ireland, is, however, much more than counterbalanced
by that of those who leave the parish and resort to towns,
tempted by the higher wages of manufactories and domestic
service.

   Occupations, Mode of Living, etc.-The inhabitants live
mostly in the open country, and chiefly in the lower and more
cultivated part of the parish; only an inconsiderable propor-
tion, not exceeding 170 souls, reside in a small village conti-
guous to the church.-The great body of the people derive
their subsistence from agriculture, and the common mecha-
nical arts connected with it.  It is computed that nearly one
third of the whole families in the parish are supported by the
wages of common labour.  Most of them, however, also rent
a garden, and a piece of indifferent ground for pot-herbs,
potatoes, and sometimes a little corn and slax.  No consider-
