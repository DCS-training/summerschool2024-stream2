be said for their wool.  It is of the coarsest kind, and little
adapted for manufacture.  A stone of it does not bring more
than 6 s.  The number of sheep is about 30,000, and there
are about 230 head of black cattle, and 40 horfes.

   Population.-The ancient state of the population of this
parish cannot be exactly ascertained. It seems, however, to
have been considerably greater in former times than at pre-
sent.  In one place, about 50 years ago, there were 32
houses; but at present, there are only three.  From this
circumstance, it would appear, that the population hath de-

In Dr Webster's report, the number is only 397.

   Productions.-Nothing but the common vegetables and

species of wood to be seen here, and that in very small quan-
tities.  Indeed, there is not so much as to answer necessary
purposes.  In former times, this country abounded with

Etterick Forest.  Not a vestige, however, of the ancient wood
now remains.  As great quantities of oak are still dug up in
the mosses, this seems to have been the prevalent species.
The number of acres employed in raising corn, roots, etc.
is not exactly known.  But it may easily be conceived, that
they are very few, when, in a square of 10 miles, there is
not so much arable ground, as to maintain 400 people with
its produce.  Barley, oats, and potatoes, are the only crops
raised.  Wheat, rye, turnip, and cabbage, are never attempt-
ed.  The parish both exports and imports articles of provi-
sions.  It exports mutton in great quantities, and imports
