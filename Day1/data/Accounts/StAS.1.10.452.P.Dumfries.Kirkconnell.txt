they did, was to establish a market, to be always held at
Kirkconnel village, twice in the year viz. on the 1st Tues-
day of May, and on the 1st Tuesday of November, for the
hiring of servants, and the sale of cattle, and of woollen yarn
and cloth.  Aware that, in every promiscuous concourse of
this kind, there may be some people too much disposed to
create disturbance, especially when, in a place like this,
there is no magistracy near at, hand to keep them in awe;
the Society have taken proper measures for preserving peace
and, good order during the time of the market.  To prevent
mistakes in buying and selling, and to facilitate the progress of
business in this way, the Winchester bushel is fixed upon as
the standard measure for grain, and the rate of markets is to
be duly notified to the clerk, from time to time, in order to
be communicated.  Such too as want either to buy or sell
any article, or to hire servants, or to be hired, are to apply to
him for information, either way, relating to the persons with
whom they may transact.  All these matters are to be insert-
ed in a journal kept for the purpose.  By means of this plan,
all the commerce of the parish is brought into in easy com-
pass, or rather concentrated in one point.  Suppose the same
thing to be done in every parish, and a communication es-
tablished with any centrical town or considerable village; es-
pecially suppose this plan improved to all the extent of which
it is capable; the utility of such a measure can need no illus-
tration.  To prevent strife, animosity, and law-suits, the
bane and scourge of any society or country, every dispute or
difference, that shall happen to arise between any of the mem-
bers of this society, relative to claims, bargains, injuries, or
offences, is to be submitted to the determination of three
neutral persons of their own number, selected by the preses,
approved by the parties; and their judgment is to be fi
nal.
