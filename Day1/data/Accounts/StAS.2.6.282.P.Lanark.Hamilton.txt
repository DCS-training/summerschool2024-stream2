	Cambric Weaving.--Hamilton has been the principal seat of imi-
tation cambric weaving since the introduction of the cotton trade
into Scotland. The reeds run from 1200 to 3000, which are the
finest setts that cotton has been wrought into. The number of
looms in Hamilton is 1291, and in the country 53. This was
at one time a thriving branch of trade, which in the course of fifty
years added to Hamilton whole streets of houses, chiefly built and
inhabited by industrious weavers. For the last fifteen or twenty years,
however, it has been on the decline; and, if possible, is still getting
worse. The average wages are from 6d. to 1s. 6d. per day; out
of which must be deducted 1s. a-week for expenses, and 10s. per
annum for loom-rent. A house with a room and kitchen, and a
four-loom shops lets at from L. 5 to L. 6. Many of the older and
more experienced hands better their circumstances considerably
by teaching apprentices. The females are employed in winding
weft, or in tambouring.
	Lace-Manufactory, &c.--The old lace-manufactory of this place,
which was introduced by one of tbe Duchesses of Hamilton, has for
many years been all but extinct. But about eight years ago a
Mr Galloch introduced a new manufactory of lace, which was im-
proved on by Mr John Gowans, and is still increasing. About twelve
respectable houses are now engaged in this lucrative and thriving
branch of, trade, and new firms are daily forming. It employs
upwards of 2500 females, in this and the neighbouring parishes.
The lace is a sort of tambotired bobinette. Vast quantities of
black silk veils of peculiar patterns are also manufactured here.
There is a great and increasing demand for both of the above ar-
ticles throughout the whole of Britain, and also in America, and
the colonies. A weaver's wife can make higher wages at this trade
than her husband. Many thousands of check-shirts have of late
been manufactured here, and sent out to Australasia. The stock-
