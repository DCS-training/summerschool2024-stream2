members to have frequently observed the vestiges of an en-
campment, on the south side of the moor, having a large mo-
rass (the mosses of Balbithan and Kinmuck) on the back, and
the burn of denmiln, or Danemiln, on the right of the camp.
The field of battle extended the whole length of the parish of 
kinkell, on the north, or above two English miles.  The
Danes were defeated, and pursued to the burn of Dennyburn,
or Danes-burn, on the other side of the parish.

   Eminent Persons.-The famous Johnston, next to Buchan-
an, the best Latin poet of modern times, was born at Caskied-
bean, which he celebrates.  He mentions a curoious fact, viz.
that the shadow of the high mountain of Benochic, distant a-
bout 6 English miles, extends to the house of Caskiebean, at
the equinox.  The High Constable of Dundee, Scrimgeour,
who fell at Harlaw, was buried at Kinkell, and has a Latin
inscription on his monument, ill preserved.  Many others,
who fell in this battle, are said to have been buried at Kinkell,
which was the principal church in that part of the county.
Tradition also speaks of an eminent woman, The Lass of
Patie's mill.  Her maiden name was Anderson.  A great
grandson of hers, aged 89, and a number of her descendants,
reside in this district, and in the parishes of Kinnellar and
Dyce.  Her father was proprietor of Patie's mill, in Keith-
hall; of Tullikearie, in Fintray; and Standing Stones, in the
parish of Dyce.  From her beauty, or fortune, or from both
causes, she had many admirers; and she was an only child.
One Sangster, laird of Boddom, in New Machar parish, wish-
ed to carry her of, but was discovered by his dog, and very
roughly handled by her father, who was called black John
Anderson.  In revenge, he wrote an ill natured song, of which
her great grandson remembers these words:
     Ye'll tell the gowk that gets her,
     He gets but my auld sheen.
