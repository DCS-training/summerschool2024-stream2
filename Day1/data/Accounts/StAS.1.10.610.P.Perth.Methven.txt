     Statistical Account

   Extent and Surface, etc.-This parish, from E. to W. is, at
an average, about 5 English miles; and between 3 and 4 from
N. to S.  The surface is agreeably varied by hollows and
rising ground : But, in general, it slopes from north to south,
where it terminates in a narrow plain, the west part of 
which is a morass, which supplies with peat the neighbour-
ing inhabitants, and from whence two streams take their
rise; the most considerable of which runs westward into the
Earn, and the other eastward into the Almond:  Both have
the name of the Pow.  The cultivated soil is, in general,
good; one part clay, another loam, and a third gravel; but
the clay soil predominates.  There is a tract of waste ground,
above 800 acres, on the north side of the parish, which was
a common, and is now divided.  A considerable part of it
is very improveable; and it is hoped, that, in due time, the
hand of persevering industry will transform the uncultivated
heath, into verdant pastures and plentiful fields.

   Rivers, etc.-The ALMOND, which bounds the greatest
part of this parish on the N. and E. is large and rapid
current of water, and, in its course, turns a number of mills
of various kinds.  Its banks are bold and rocky, and in ma-
ny places agreeably wooded.  It furnishes some very pic-
tureque and romantic views, as it passes the estate of
Lednock, the property of Mr Graham of Balgowan.  It
was formerly well stored with fine trout, etc.; but the late
erection of a high dike to raise the water, which supplies
the cotton spinning, and other works, of Cromwell Park,
prevents almost every kinds of fish from penetrating any far-
ther; and probably, in a short time, they will entirely desert
the river.
