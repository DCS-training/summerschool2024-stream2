tigate the evils of compulsory provision. There are instances of
backward ness on the part of individuals to apply for parochial re-
lief; but they are rare.
   Fuel.-The fuel used is coal, and a small quantity of peat. The
coal is principally carried from the Lothians, and costs about L.1,
Is. per ton. English coal can be purchased in Kelso at a cheaper
rate, but it is considered to be of inferior quality and is little
used.
