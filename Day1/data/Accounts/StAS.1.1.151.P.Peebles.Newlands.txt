The annual average of births from 1719 till 1749, both in-   
   cluded                                             26 9/10
From 1770 till 1790, both included                    24

   The inhabitants are composed of farmers, quarriers, other
labourers, and a few of the most indispensible mechanics.
There are 13 heritors, of whom 5 reside.

   Wages, and Prices of Provisions.-Nearly the same as was
mentioned in the foregoing parish of Linton.

<TABLE>

Rent.-The gross rent of the parish is   L.2500
From lime and coal about                   100

   Church, etc.-The value of the glebe and stipend is L. 115.
The present minister, Charles Findlater batchellor, succeeded
Dr James Moffat in June 1790.  The manse was built 30 or
40 years ago, and the church was then repaired.  The manse
has received several additions and repairs within the last ten
years.

   Poor.-The poor are supported from a stock of L. 80, se-
cured on a bond of the trustees for the roads at 5 per cent.
and from voluntary contributions, and dues for proclamation
and funerals, without poors rates.  The annual average ex-
pence of the poor, from July 1773 till July 1782, L. 12 2 4 1/4
From July 1782 till July 1790,                       21 1 11 1/2
The difference from year to year in the last period is incon-
siderable:  The L. 80 stock having been got within that pe-
riod, the poor were probably more liberally treated.  In 1782
-3, meal was bought in by the session, and sold at an under
rate.  Some heritors maintained all the poor on their own 
lands.  The roads in Newlands are under the fame act as in
Linton, and statute labour commuted at the fame rates.
