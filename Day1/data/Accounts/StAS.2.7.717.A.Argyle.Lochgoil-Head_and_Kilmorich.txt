one another in plying them with this dangerous indulgence. It
will scarcely be believed, that 1O per cent. of the price of the fish
is expended in whisky, yet this is the estimate formed by persons
thoroughly acquainted with the business. Many of the fishermen
are beginning to see that so many drams are not given them gratis,
but are paid for out of their own industry, and would willingly give
up the practice.  This happy step has been taken to some extent
in the northern lochs; and it is to be hoped the good example will
be followed by those in the south.

		     PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Villages.--The principal village is Lochgoil-head, which only
contains a population of 117 persons.  Several neat cottages have
been built last year at the head of the loch, and as the locality is de-
sirable, and the proprietor disposed to feu, it is probable that the
village will be soon considerably increased.
   Ecclesiastical State.--Both the churches are in an excellent state
of repair, and afford accommodation for 800 sitters.  The present
manse and office-houses were built in 1841, and, it is believed,
there are not any in Scotland more complete.  The glebe and
servitude attached to it may be valued at from L.30 to L.40.
The amount of the stipend is, meal, 9O 1/2 bolls, money, L.34, 7s.
2 1/4d. Exchequer allowance, L.42, 15s. 10d.  The average
amount of collections for religious purposes is from L.6 to L.10.

                MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

would not only impart an increased air of civilization, but also be

paring these two lines of business, greater progress appears to have
been made in the business of grazing than in agriculture.  The
