   There are other remains of camps in the parish, but none of
them so entire.  There were found a few years ago, in a tumulus
at the bottom of Tinto, on the east side, some bones of a human
body, but not the skull ; and as the grave was shorter than the
ordinary dimensions, it was supposed that the body had been bu-
ried after being decapitated.  About a quarter of a mile north
from this, another tumulus was opened about the same time, and
in it were found two urns, one of which was broken by the work-
men.  The preserved one fell into the hands of Mr Carmichael,
Younger of Eastend.  About fifty yards north from the village,
in an enclosure, the plough still turns up occasionally stones with
lime adhering to them, where there has been a building, (said to
have been called the Place,) understood to have been the residence
of Symington of Symington.  The moat is still visible on all sides;
and although the field has been long cultivated, some old people
recollect of part of a building standing.
   On Tinto, a little above the base on the south-east side, there
are the remains of an ancient castle, called Fatlips: a piece of
the wall, about two yards high, is still standing : its thickness is
fully six feet, and it adheres so firmly, that persons building a
stone fence lately chose rather to quarry stone than take them
from the wall. *
