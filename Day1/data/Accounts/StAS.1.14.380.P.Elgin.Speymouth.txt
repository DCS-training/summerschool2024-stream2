as they say they have the rye over and above what they
would otherwise have in oats.  They allow the ground
to rest in ley, sometimes 4 years, but generally no more
than 3: The proportion of such ley is not above a fifth,
or even a sixth of their farm.  This frequency of crop-
ping will no doubt appear strange; yet it is not peculiar
to this place.  It was pretty much the universal prac-
tice over the N. of Scotland, not very many years ago,
and is still pretty general among the smaller tenants:
They seem to acknowledge the error of this practice
here, but say, they cannot do otherwise, as they must
raise so much corn, for bread to their families, and fod-
der to their cattle.  Oats is the staple produce of the
parish, and seem to answer best with the soil in general.
The oats here generally used are of a kind peculiar to
the place, called Haugh or Dipple oats; and when sown
in ground properly prepared, are of an excellent qua-
lity.  They are a middle kind, between the early and
late oats; and are beginning to be in request in the
neighbourhood.  Rye succeeds very well in our light
soil.  In some places, barley is used; but in general
Scots bear or big is preferred, as a richer crop.  Neither
the one or the other are found to succeed very well in
the upper parts of the parish; nor are pease or red clo-
ver found to answer well, except in the grounds below
the bank or nigh the Spey.  To produce grass fit for
making hay, or pease, or even barley or bear, in any
proportion, lime is found necessary in most parts of the
ground above the bank.  But with the assistance of lime,
all these crops succeed very well: and, from the expe-
rience of the best farmers in this neighbourhood, it is
found, that lime is particularly adapted to light, thin,
dry soil, especially such as has been originally improved
