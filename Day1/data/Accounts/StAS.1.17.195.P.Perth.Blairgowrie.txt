long let at 100 merks; it now gives 30 l. Sterling.  Plenty
of trouts are found in the Ericht.  The Ardle also washes
this parish for a short way on the north.  Sometimes salmon
are caught in it, and it abounds with trouts.  Like the Isla

two burns, or rivulets, remarkable only for their exoellent
trouts, and for driving some corn and lint mills.

   Lakes, Islands, etc.-The parish abounds with lakes of
different sizes.  Till lately there were more, but some have
been drained, and now supply the neighbourhood with peats
and marl*.  In the lakes which still remain, great quantities
of pikes and perches are caught, partly with the rod, and
partly with nets.  They are much frequented by wild fowls
of different kinds.  In the middle of one of them are the
remains of an old building on a small island in it, in which
tradition says treasures were concealed in perilous times.  A
district in this county is said to have acquired the appella-

exercise at which the inhabitants of this district excel.

the parish, neither is it well supplied with free-stone, though
there are two quarries of this kind.  Some whin-stone qua-

plenty.  There is one chalybeate spring in the Cloves of
Mawes, which was formerly much resorted to by persons in
its neighbourhood.  It has been used, it is said, with success
in scorbutic disorders.  There are appearances of several

animal was uncovered, at least 12 feet below the surface.  The
horns resemble those of a deer, and are of a very large size.
