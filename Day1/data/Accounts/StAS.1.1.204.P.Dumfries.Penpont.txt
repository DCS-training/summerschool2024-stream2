     Statistical Account

   The lower end is washed by the Nith, a considerable river,
which divides Penpont from Durrisdeer and Morton, and by
the Scarr, which is the march between it and Tynron and
Keir.  On the south-west, the Scarr runs between Penpont
and Tynron for 5 miles.  The hills on both sides are so steep
anh high, and the bottom so narrow, rocky, and woody, that
the general view is pleasant to those who have any taste for 
romantic scenes.  At Chanlocksoo, the ridge, which springs
up suddenly between two valleys, has its face wholly covered
with trees, both of which views are particularly delightful.  In
the bosom fo the north-east ridge you discover Glenquhargen
Craig, almost perpendicular, and above 1000 feet in highth.
It has two faces that strike the eye, and no other rock is to be
seen on either side.  It is a hard brownish whin stones.  Some
samll pieces are fallen down, with sharp edges and angular
points.  It is one of the greatest curiosities in the south of Scot-

lower down, is called the Canal.  The general prospect down
the rivers Nith and Scarr is extensive and bearutiful, consist-
ing of level ground highly cultivated, gentle risings, wooods,
villas, and mountains.  The manse and church stand on a 
plain, about 30 feet above the Scarr, which winds about, in
the form of an S, from south-west to north-east.  There is
from hence a distinct view of the rivers for 8 miles, first se-
perate and then united.  The pools here and there shew them-
selves as smooth sheets of water; and in floods the low ground
is inundated for a mile broad, and 6 farm towns surrounded to
the very doors.  Prospects worthy of notice every where pre-
sent themselves.  At the old bridge, already mentioned, the
banks of the Scarr are high, and skirted with wood; the chan-
nel rocky, and full of large stones; the bridge itself venerable,
by a complete mantle of ivy and woodbine.  Very near it, the
