head of it with this compliment-"My Lord, I am very glad to
see you, but by - you have been very dilatory, and we can
give you nothing to eat."* To which his Lordship answered
laughingly with his usual good humour-"I assure you, Sir An-
drew, I made all the haste I possibly could; and I hope that you
and the officers will do me the honour to partake with me of such
fare as I can give you."
   The Hessians would not march from Dunkeld with lord Craw-
furd against the Highlanders. They were horror-struck at the
thought of Killiecrankie. Their commandant feared the swords
of the wild mountaineers, as he called them, and which had but
recently twice beaten the King's troops with their regular artillery
and fire-arms.
   Public thanks were afterwards given to the garrison by the Duke
of Cumberland, for its steady and gallant defence of the castle, and
Sir Andrew Agnew was rewarded with the colonelcy of a regiment
of marines.

   Parochial Registers.-The register of marriages, or rather of
the proclamation of bans, is well kept.  There never was a re-
gister of burials; and the register of births and baptisms, pretty
regular and well kept from 1750, fell into disrepute with the pa-

<FOOTNOTE>Of Sir Andrew's peculiarities and fiery temper, there are many reminiscences.
The writer used to hear the following related, and long before he knew the scene of
its operations, by a much esteemed and particular friend.

One morning in a loop-hole in the castle. The trick succeeded, and the Highlanders
instantly commenced pouring their fire upon the window.  Sir Andrew was startled
at the sudden incessant fire directed against one particular spot, and, upon going to
reconnoitre, he soon discovered the reason; and a loud peremptory order was issued,
that the playful hero should remove from the view of the Highlanders the object
which had excited their hostility, and that, too, without delay, during the hottest of
their fire.
          These are shealings, or summer grazings, to which no valued rent is attached.
