tions have taken place in this spot three or four times with-
in his recollection, at the distance of twelve or sixteen years
from each other.
   I have heard of no figured stone but one, which was
lately found in the foundation of an old house; the back
of which house formed part of the wall of the church-yard.
It exhibits the figure of a man, very rudely cut, with his
head uncovered, and having a loose garment, like a High-
land plaid, thrown over his shoulders.  With the one hand
he lays hold of the mouth of an animal, which has been
thought to be a lion, but has more appearance of a wild
boar.  With the other, he brandishes a sword or dagger,
with which he threatens destruction to his prey.  There
has been an inscription over the head of this figure as
would seem, in Saxon characters.  But only two or three
of these are now discernible; as the stone has not only been
broken into two pieces, but has been otherwise mutilated,
by the unsparing hands of some workmen employed to
repair the wall. It is not improbable, that this might be
an ancient grave-stone.
   In a rock, at the western extremity of the parish, exactly
on the north side of the bridge of Cortachie, a very coarse
kind of marble is found, in small veins.  Not far from this,
in the parish of Cortachie, is a rock, the stones found in
which, from the description given of them, seem to resem-
ble quartz.  They have somewhat the appearance of gold,
most probably in consequence of metallic impregnation;
whence the rock itself is called the Golden Craig.  The pa-
rish of Tannadice abounds with free-stone and moor-stone.
The large stones found in the field in detached pieces, are
here generally called outliers, to distinguish them from
those sound in beds.  There is also abundance of the stone
vulgarly called scurdie, the same which is commonly known
by the name of whin in the western parts of Scotland, and
