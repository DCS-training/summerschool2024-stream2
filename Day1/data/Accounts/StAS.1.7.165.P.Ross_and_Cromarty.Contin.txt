rishes, principally from Easter Ross.-About 50 acres are in
sown-grass on the Mains of Coul, and a few acres on another
farm.  The farmers have seldom sowed any, (except a few
pounds in their gardens); nor can they be prevailed upon to
do it, though they have got long leases from Colonel Mac-
kenzie of Coul, (19 years) to encourage them to raise grass;
and the soil is found to be admirably calculated for it, yield-
ing from 200 to 300 stones the acre.  Colonel Mackenzie
has not imposed one shilling of additional rent upon his
whole property in this parish.-They begin to sow oats and
rye in February; but, in most places, in the latter end of
March, and whole of April.  Barley is sown by the begin-

the neighbouring parishes, and was safely ingathered even
this very year by the end of October.-There is great plenty
of shelly marl now discovered in the Loch of Kinellan, upon
the estate of Coul; and the proprietor, at his own expence,
has so far drained the Loch, as to have easy access to the
working of the marl; and the tenants have full liberty to take
from it whatever quantity they please for the use of their
lands.  The Lake is also surrounded with stone-marl, which
has been found by the farmers there to meliorate the ground
very much.  This Lake lies five miles to the west of Ding-
wall.  There is lime-stone also found on the Coul property,
but difficult to work.  There was this year discovered, on
the property of Mr Mackenzie of Strathgarvie, (a minor), a
rich lime-stone quarry, which could be easily wrought, and
to great advantage, there being plenty of peats and wood
close by the quarry.  The proprietor of the quarry has close
by it betwixt 300 and 400 acres of arable ground admirably
calculated for lime, on which property there are no less, at
present, than 50 or 60 families, without any industry, or any
