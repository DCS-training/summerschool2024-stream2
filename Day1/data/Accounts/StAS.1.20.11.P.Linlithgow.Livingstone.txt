the small end, and the same operation repeated.  This clay
pipe has conducted a small rill of water a considerable way
under ground, for more than 20 years, without any sign of
failing.
   This suggests what would be a great discovery, were it
practicable, viz. the leading of water into a city, etc. by
means of a pipe made of lime-mortar.  It is an established
fact, that lime-mortar, when immersed in water, acquires a
greater degree of hardness and cohesion than when exposed
to the air*.  There appears to be no difficulty in furnish-
ing a pipe of this kind with both air and cleanging cocks;
but it does not so readily occur how a fracture might be
repaired.
   Before concluding this subject, we cannot help communi-
cating to the public a hint, which, if well founded, merits
their attention.  It is but too well known, that sheep who
have been breed in a moorish country, and fed chiefly upon
heath, when brought to a low country, and fed upon a rich
pasture, are liable to die of a disease called the rot, a species
of dropsy.
   It is said that the diuretic quality of parsley, of which
sheep are fond, prevents this disease.  When a field, there-
fore, intended for sheep-pasture, is laid down, 2 or 3 pounds
to an acre of this seed, added to the other common grass-
seeds, would be no hazardous experiment; no seed can be
more easily procured.  Hares are also said to be fond of
parsley, if so, this kind of stock, which affords both food and
diversion, may be thus brought to hand without much trouble
or expence.

   Antiquities.-On this head we beg of our readers, and
the patron of this work, a little indulgence.
