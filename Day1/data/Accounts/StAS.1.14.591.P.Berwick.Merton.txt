lars, throughout the year, may be from 30 to 40.-Poor's
rates were established in the 1771, and are nearly 21 L. a-
year; which, with the average annual collections 11 L., is
generally sufficient.  The heritors, however, by no means
restrict themselves to this, but cheerfully assess themselves
to the full amount of what the minister and session deem
necessary.  The landlords and tenants pay in equal pro-
portions; and though the latter are not consulted when
the assessment is made, they have never been known to
grudge their share.

   Fisheries.-There are no rivers in the parish, but the
Tweed, forming the southern boundary; there are 3 incon-
siderable salmon fisheries, which together may amount to
20 L. or 25 L. a-year.  They might unquestionably be greatly
improved, were the mode of fishing altered.  The proprie-
tors, however, have never as yet bestowed any attention
on this object; and consequently the fishers follow the
practice of their forefathers, angling, setting small nets in
cairns, when the river is in flood, and killing them with
listers, when the river is small and the evening serene;
and this they call burning the water, because they are ob-
liged to carry a lighted torch in the boat.  Long nets,
such as are used near to Berwick, and upon the Tay and
Tummel in the N., might certainly be employed in many
places with great safety and advantage.

   Proprietors and Rent.-There are 5 heritors, all of whom
have dwelling-houses in the parish.  The valued rent is
5675 L. 10 s. 6 d. Scotch.: real rent about 2400 L. Sterling.

   Minerals.-There is an inexhaustible store of free-
stone all along the banks of the Tweed; but one quarry
