     Statistical Account

   That the poverty of the ministers of religion is not only,
injurious to them, but also to the peace and order of so-
ciety, will be allowed by every person who thinks a Na-
tional Church of any use.  He who is in easy circumstan-
ces will be forward in acts of goodness, and shew a pattern
of that charity which he recommends.  He will diffuse a
spirit of contentment joy, and industry, every where about
him.  In him the Church will find an enlightened friends
and the State a prudent, firm champion.  When he goes
about the sacred duties of religion; he commands respect by
the integrity and benevolence of his life, which gives
weight to all he says.  He, on the contrary, who lives on
L. 75 or L. 80 per annum in a parish where there are many
tithes, is in danger of becoming sullen and indifferent to a
Government where he suffers so much injustice.
