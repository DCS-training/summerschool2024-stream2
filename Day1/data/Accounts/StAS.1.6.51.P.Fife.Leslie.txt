   Since 1785, the population has not materially altered.

   The great disproportion between the males and females in
the town, and the difference in the country part of the parish,
will appear strange, but may thus be accounted for: In the
town, the number of maid-servants is greater than that of
men-servants, and the reverse, in the country.  Another rea-
son may be, that the farmers in the neighbourhood purchase
houses in Leslie for their wives to inhabit, after their death,
and to which they come with their unmarried daughters.  Be-
sides, in the country part of the parish, the farmers have no
more dwelling-houses than are sufficient for themselves and
their servants: when, therefore, a cottager dies, his cottage
must be let to another man to carry on the work of the farm,
and the widow of the former, in that case, unless she hath
a son to supply his father's place, or a married daughter to
whom she might go to live with, rents a house in Leslie, that
she may get coals driven for hire, and such other things to
buy as are necessary for her subsistence: and, besides all
these, some old women get houses in Leslie that they be near
the church and the meeting-houses, of which there are two
in town, one of the sect of Seceders, called Burghers, and
the other Antiburghers.  The town is choakfull of people,
and has neither an empty nor ruinous house in it.
   The increase of inhabitants in the country part of the parish,
from 1759 to 1785, is probably occasioned by the establish-
ment of two bleachfields; for the farmers in general keep
