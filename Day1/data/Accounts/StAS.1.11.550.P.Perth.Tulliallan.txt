     Statistical Account

   Village and Markets, etc.-KINCARDINE is a pretty large
village on the banks of the Forth, containing 312 houses, sub-
stantially built, and are generally finished neatly in the inside.
A considerable number of them consist of two, and some of
them of three flats.  They are mostly covered with tiles, and
built upon pan ashes; which, being naturally dry, contributes
greatly to the health of the inhabitants.  There are two mar-
ket days in the week, viz. Wednesday and Saturday, which
are generally well supplied with provisions. Beef, mutton,
veal, and lamb, sell from 3 d. to 5 d. the lb; butter from 8 d.
to rod; and cheese from 3 d. to 4 d. the lb: fowls, from 1 s. to
14 d. a piece; aduck at 8 d.; a chicken 8 d.; eggs from 4 d. to
6 d. the dozen.  There is a post office in the village of Kincar-
dine; and we have two posts from Edinburgh regularly every
day in the week, the one by Stirling, and the other by the
Queensferry.  By the latter, all letters from Fife, Perth, and
the North Country, are conveyed.  For these last three
years, the amount paid into it, by this parish only, was
247 l. 10 s. 7 d.

   Roads, Ferry, and Harbour-The roads are extremely bad
in winter, in soft weather, though good in summer.  The pa-
rish affords no materials to make them of, but free-stone and
pan ashes, which carriages soon grind to powder.  There is
passage boat between Kincardine and Higgin's Nuek, at present
on a very incommodious footing.  It is only within 2 hours,
before and after flood, that they can pass with a horse; and foot
passengers are often obliged, at low water, to wade through
mud for 40 yards.  The shipmasters here, by a voluntary
contribution, have begun to build a pier.  If their finances
allow them to finish it, it will be a great advantage to those
who have occasion to pass here.
