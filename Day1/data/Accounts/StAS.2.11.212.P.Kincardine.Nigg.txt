	Fuel.--Peats and turf are used a good deal in country houses,
and by the white-fishermen in Cove and Burnbanks for smoking
and curing Finnan haddocks; the turf being procured from the
mosses belonging to Mr Menzies and others, in the upper part of
the parish, and in Nether Banchory. But many use coals, par-
ticularly in Torry and neighbourhood.

	Revised 1838.
