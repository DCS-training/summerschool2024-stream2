     Statistical Account

   Fuel.-There is a small quantity of moss in the S. E. part
of the parish, from which a few peats are dug, but these are
solely appropriated to the kindling of fires, coals being the
only fuel used in this district, as they abound both in this
parish and in the neighbourhood.  The average price of great
coal is 2 s. 6 d. for 40 stones, and, for the same quantity of
chows, or small coal, 1 s. 3 d. The carriage paid for a single
horse cart of coals is 4 d. per mile.  But here it will be pro-
per to give a particular account of the coal mines on the dif-
ferent estates in this parish.

   Blair Colliery-There are two reins of coal, the one 4 and
the other 7 feet thick; both of which have been wrought
some years, and are still working.  They are of a stoney qua-
lity, and emit a very considerable heat when used as house
fuel.  They are fold at 1 s. 3 d. per cart (of 40 stones weight),
exclusive of carriage.  The small coal has been found to
answer well for burning lime, and for falt-works.  Under
these two veins of coal there are other two; the one 2 feet
10 inches, and the other 3 feet thick.  The former is a Splint
coal, the latter a Smithy coal of a good quality.  Of these two
veins only a small part has yet been wrought, as they are
under level.  Preparations, however, are now making for
working both*.

   Merrylees Colliery.-This coal-work is the property of Mr.
MUTTER of Annfield, and has been wrought to a considerable
extent for these 8 years past.  The last lease taken of it was
at the rent of 100 l. Sterling, and a steam engine was erected

<FOOTNOTE>

*On the Blair estate there is also iron stone, both of the bed and ball kind
but,no proper trial has yet been made to ascertain quality.
