     NUMBER XXV.

     PARISH OF PRIMROSE, OR, CARRINGTON,

     (COUNTY OF EDINBURGH, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND 
     TWEEDDALE, PRESBYTERY OF DALKEITH)

     By the Rev. Mr. JOHN FLEMING.

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   THE original name of this parish seems to have been
Carrington, which is always pronounced, and very
often spelled Cairnton.  Of the origin of this name, no sa-
tisfactory account occurs.  As far back as the year 1711,
it seems to have received the name of Primrose, most pro-
bably from the family of that name having acquired a
very large proportion of the landed property which it con-
tains.  But although, since the period above mentioned.
which is the earliest at which any parish records appear,
it has always passed under the name of Primrose in writ-
ing, such is the attachment of mankind to whatever is
ancient, that, in the oral communications of the neigh-
bourhood, it still, for the most part, retains the name of
Cairnton.  At the extreme points, its length, from E. to
W., is about 3 1/2, and its breadth, from S. to N., 2 miles.
