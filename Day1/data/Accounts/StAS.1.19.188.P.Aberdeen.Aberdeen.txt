   Anno 1739, the town of Aberdeen formed a resolu-
tion of erecting an Infirmary in Aberdeen, for the benefit
of the diseased, in all the northern parts of the kingdom.
For carrying this purpose into execution, subscriptions were
set on foot, and the well disposed were so liberal in pro-
moting this pious design, that a part of the house for the
accommodation of patients was finished anno 1742, in a
plain but decent manner.  An addition was made to the
house anno 1745, by which they were enabled to admit a

funds are about L. 400 Sterling; and for the other L. 900
they depend upon collections through different parishes,
and upon donations.
   Anno 1786, Baillie James Cruickshank, merchant in
this city, represented to the managers, that some persons,
desirous of promoting the prosperity and success of the In-
firmary, (but who wish to remain unknown), had resolved
to ease it, in a great measure, of the debt it then laboured
under, by paying a sum of L. 500 Sterling for that purpose.
He also informed them, that some persons had agreed to
make a donation of L. 1500 Sterling, to be stocked for the
benefit of the Infirmary, and the interest thereof for ever
to be applied for the use of the patients in general; and he
