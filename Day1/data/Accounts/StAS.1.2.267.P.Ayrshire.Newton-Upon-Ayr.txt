   From the above statement, the number of births, at an a-
verage, amounts to above 46, and of marriages, about 13 an-
nually.  No exact account can be given of the number of
deaths, as no proper burial ground has been allotted for the
use of the inhabitants; the greatest part burying in Prestick or
Ayr, in St Quivox, and the burying ground belonging to the
Seceding meeting-house, in the parish of St Quivox.  Burial-
ground is much needed; which the community might pro-
vide, at a small expence, by inclosing a part of their waste land,
in the vicinity of the town. The number of deaths is suppos-
ed to amount to 30, annually.-The whole of the inhabi-
tants belong to the Established Church, a few families excep-
ted, (About 12 in all,) who are mostly of the sect, called the 
Antiburgher Seceders.
