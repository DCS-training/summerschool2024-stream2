dually decreases in price, as the season advances, to 2 1/2 d. 2
pound.  It is all sold in the town of Dumfries, and to the
families in the adjacent country.  Dumfries being so near,
and many of the fisherman living in the town, the price in
that market, and on the spot where it is caught in this parish,
is always the same.  The prices of the other kinds of fish are
always a little lower than that of salmon; and they rise and
fall with it.  About ten years ago, the price of fish in this
country was scarcely half of what it is at present.  The in-
creased price is perhaps owing, in part, to the increased con-
sumption, and luxury of the inhabitants, but principally to
the great demand for this fish, to supply the rich and popu-
lous manufacturing towns in Lancashire; for, within these
last ten years, very considerable quantities of fresh salmon
have been sent, by land carriage, into that country, from the
Solway Frith, and the mouths of all the rivers that run into
it.

   Soil.-The soil of this parish is of four different kinds, via
a considerable tract of land, about a fourth part of the parish,
in the east, along the river Nith, and, on the south, for about
seven miles up the river Cluden, is a deep rich light loam, and
free from stones:  2d, Another fourth part, contiguous to the
former, is a light dry fertile soil, lying on a bed of sandy gra-
vel, producing heavy crops of corn and grass in a showery
season; but it is greatly parched up in dry seasons:  3d, An-
other fourth part, which joins this last, is a deep strong loam,
interspersed with stones, upon a tilly bed; it is naturally wet,
liff to plough, and not so fertile as either of the two former
but, when drained, limed, and properly wrought, more pro-
ductive both of corn and grass than either of them, in
all varieties of season, excepting only a cold and wet summer-
job, The searching part, which is hilly, is somewhat similar
