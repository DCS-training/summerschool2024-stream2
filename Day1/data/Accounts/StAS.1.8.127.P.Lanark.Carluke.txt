     of Carluke.

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-The air here, is thought to be as
pure and salubrious, as in any part of Scotland.  Hence few
epidemical distempers have prevailed in this parish, even when
raging in other places, owing perhaps to the S. and S. W.
exposures, and the quick circulation of air, which our situa-
tion must necessarily occasion.  There are many instances of
longevity in this parish.  There were 3 in the same family,
(a brother and two sisters), all above 80 years of age, and
alive at the same time.  Two died lately at the age of 89, and
other 2, who had lived to the advanced period of 99.  A com-
plete year elapsed, not long ago, without the loath of a full
grown person.  At present, there are several people living
here, all above the age of 80*.

*The Iliac Passion, within these few years, has proved fatal to 6 or 8 in this
parish.  It is proper to mention, that injections have proved the most aficaciou*
remedy in this disorder.  A young man lately, who had been affected with it
for 18 days, and every dangerous symptom had appeared, was entirely relieved
by the frequent use of them.
