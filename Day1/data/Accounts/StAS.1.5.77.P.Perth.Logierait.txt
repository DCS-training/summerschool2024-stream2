sionally dug up in our mosses.  The woods growing through
this parish, occupy about 800 acres of ground.  The trees
are oaks, ashes, elms, beaches, planes, poplars, birches,
larches, allers, willows, the Scotch and the spruce fir, the
liburnum, and the walnut-tree.  The soil and situation are
friendly to fruit trees, and equally so to the currant and the
gooseberry bush, and to other shrubs of a similar character.
The vegetables cultivated here, as articles of crop, are bar-
ley, oats, rye, pease, potatoes, and in our gardens, the com-
mon pot herbs.

   Agriculture.-Of the lands in this parish, between 2500
and 3000 acres may be arable.  Several thousands of acres
are waste, and in common; 200 acres are annually planted
with potatoes; 50 may be covered with rye and pease;
200 are kept for pasture in gentlemen's inclosures; about
1200 are sown with oats; 100 acres have been sown with
artificial grass feeds, of which the farmers made the first
trial in 1790; 200 are sown with flax; and the rest of the
ground which is annually plowed, is sown with barley.
The fields, whether in crop or in pasture, are in general
open; but of the advantages of inclosures, we are all fully
sensible.  About 200 ploughs are employed in the cultiva-
tion of our lands; on the uplands, the plough is drawn by
4 horses yoked a-breast, and the driver walks backwards.
On the plains, when 4 horses are employed, they are yoked
two and two; and in some instances, 2 horses draw the
plough, without a driver; 400 carts are used in the parish,
although 30 years since we had not 50 among us.

   Exports and Imports.-An hundred stone weight of but-
ter, 200 stone weight of Scotch, and from 3 to 4000 lbs
of Suffolk cheese, are annually consumed in this parish, in
