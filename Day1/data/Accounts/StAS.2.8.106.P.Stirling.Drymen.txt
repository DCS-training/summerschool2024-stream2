the two oldest of which are now in a very decayed and imperfect
condition. The earliest date is 1676. The record from 1677
to 1721 is wanting. After that period, with the exception of a
gap from 1740 to 1743, they seem fully and accurately kept.
The earliest date of the minutes of session is 1723. The oldest
date in the church-yard is, 1618.
  Antiquities.-On the farm, of Garfarran, and within the barony
of Drummond, are the remains of a Roman fort called the Peel of
Garfarran, (castle of vexation.) It is at the western extremity of
the Flanders moss,-and was erected by the Romans, probably
to protect them from the assaults of the natives, who had bdtaken
themselves to the forest. This fort is nearly square.
  The outer and inner rampart are still quite discernible-as al-
so the fosse surrounding it, with the opening through which it
might be filled from the rivulet which runs near.
  The names of two places in the parish indicate the sites of re-
ligious houses, viz. Chapel-Laroch, (site of a church or chapel)
near Gartmore;-the ruins of this chapel, which existed in 1724,
when the laird of Duchray wrote his account of the parish, have
now completely disappeared. And Knockinhaglish, (hill or knoll
of the church,) on the lands of Finnich Drummond, not far from
the sainted well already spoken of.
  At a short distance from this, on the farm of E. Cameron, a
large cairn was broken up, about twenty years ago,-in which a
number of stone coffins were discovered, and human bones found
therein; but there is no tradition as to the origin of the cairn, or
the occupants of these kist-vaens.

    By the returns made to Dr Webster in 1755, the population was 2789
    By census of                         1791,          .     .   1607

           Do.                           1821,           .    .   1652
           Do.                           1831,       .      .     1690

  The great decrease which took place from 1745 to 1791, was
mainly owing to the union of small farms-the breaking up of the
system of cotteries-and the inducements held out to the rural popu-
latiop to settle in manufacturing towns. The vestiges of such de-
populations are very visible. The desert walls and ruins of many
a cottage, with the solitary trees overhanging them in the different
districts of this parish, show the change, somewhat melancholy,
that has come over it. And the many unclaimed lairs in the church-
yard, tell of many families having passed away, who once lived, here
in simplicity and peace. It is for the moralist and the philanthro-
