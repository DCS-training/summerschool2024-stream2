few years; but in general thrive better here, than in much of 
the clay soil in the neighbourhood.

   Cattle-There are about 66 labouring horses in the parish,
besides a few young ones, and about 200 milk cows, the 
young ones of which, annually reared, may be between 40 
and 50.  Few sheep are reared in the parish; but in the parks 
around the manor house, there are always a number fed for 
slaughter, and no where is better mutton to be found.  It
deserves here to be remarked, that an experiment was made 
a few years ago, of smearing some of these sheep with tar.
But it seems, in these warm sheltered fields, it was improper
to continue such a practice, the smeared sheep turning out 
inferior both in mutton and wool.  As this experiment, how-

down as a general rule. 

   Fish-The proprietor has a salmon fishing on the river
clyde, of which he avails himself only for family use, giving
away, to friends and neighbours, what fish are caught more 
than necessary for his own table.  The other fish found in 
the river, besides salmon and their progeny of grauls, fry, 
and pars, are trouts, lampreys, silver eels, pike, perch, roach,
minnows, and a few horse or pearl mussels.  In the river Cal-
der, near its mouth, salmon are also found, and farther up, a
good deal of small trouts, silver eels, etc.

   Roads and Bridges.-A turnpike road, from Lanark to
Glasgow, runs, form south east to north west, through the
parish; and upon the west boundary, there is a bridge over
the Calder.  The turnpike road from Edinburgh, through
Hamilton, which crosses this parish from north east to south
west, enters it by another bridge over the same river.  Be-
