from 10 s. to 1 L. Sterling per acre.  There are two farms let
for grazing, without the liberty of plowing, for 1 L. 1 s. and
1 L. 3 s. Sterling per acre.  Since 1763, the arable land yields
above four times the rent it drew then:  And one farm, be-
longing to the Earl of SELKIRK, yields 14 times the rent it
paid in the year 1761; yet the rents are better paid, and
the farmers live better, than they did at that period.

   Cultivation, lnclosures, etc.-This is a country fully bet-
ter calculated for grazing than for the plough, though it
produces large crops when properly rested and manured.
Hence the best farmers have constantly in view the me-
lioration of their grass.  Though sensible of the benefit of
inclosures, and even willing to pay 7 1/2 d. per cent per annum
of the money laid out upon them, very little as yet is effectu-
ally done in that way, owing to our stones being hurt by the ac-
tion of the sun and air, which makes the fences soon give way;
our ground, interrupted by rocky and gravelly knolls, renders
hedging and ditching ineffectual, unless a degree of labour,
care, and attention be given them, which the farmer has nei-
time nor inclination to bestow.  The want of wood for
coping exposes the young thorns to the ravages of cattle;
and a polled Galloway cow, if once she can thrust in her
nose, with shut eyes will force her way through a strong
hedge.  To remedy these defects, Lord SELKIRK plants his
hedges in a stone facing, and builds up the stones for coping
and fencing.  One thing is still wanting; viz. that his Lord-
ship should agree with a gardener, or skilful workman, to keep
his hedges in proper order, at so much per rood, the tenants
paying the expence along with the rent; this he has already
done with respect to clearing his estate of moles.
