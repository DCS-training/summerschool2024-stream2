   Cattle.-The number of horses cannot well be ascertained,
as the farmers very seldom keep more than what is necessary
for labouring their land.  Then number may be betwixt 80
and 90.  A few black cattle are bred for sale, especially year
olds; but, in general, they content themselves with as many
milk cows as they can conveniently keep, finding this equally
profitable.  The number of black cattle may be about 190.
Sheep being the staple commodity of this country, the store-
masters appropriate most of their time to that employment:
And as other parts of Scotland, similar to this, have improv-
ed their breed of sheep, they are no behind their neighbours
in this respect.  Accordingly, within these 10 years, the
sheep farms have greatly increased in value, at the same time
that the tenants appear to be doing well.  The breed of
sheep is the same with those in other parts of Tweeddale,
which are too well known to need description.  Their num-
ber may amount to 8700.  The wool, for several years past,
has sold from 7 s. to 9 s. the stone.

   Rent of the Parish.-The valued rent is 3301 l. 18 s. 2 d.
Scots; the present rent may be about 1685 l. Sterling.
There are five heritors, two of whom occasionally reside, and
are improving their lands with much spirit and success.  There
is one tenant who pays about 100 guineas per annum, but does
not reside in the parish; there is another who pays 220 l.;
two others pay 150 l. and five 100 l. a year each.  The
other seven pay from 20 l. to 60. l. of yearly rent.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants appears to have
greatly decreased since the beginning of this century.  About
50 years ago, there were 35 tenants, whereas at present there
are only 16, as above enumerated.  The population, in 1755,
amounted to 320; at present, it is only 229.  This diminution
is difficult to be accounted for, as it can hardly be ascribed to
