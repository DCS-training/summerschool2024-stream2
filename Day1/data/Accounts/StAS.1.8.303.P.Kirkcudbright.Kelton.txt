     of Kelton.

   Wages, Servants, etc.-The common rate of wages given to
a man' servant, fit for every branch of husbandry, is from 8
to 9 guineas per annum.  And the wages given to the best
women servants, are from 3 L. 10 s. to 4 L. 10 s. per annum.
Forty years ago, the very best men servants received no more
than 2 L. per annum, and the best female servants 15 s. Ster-
ling.  The common rate of wages, then, was considerably
lower than is stated above.  Cotter's wages are now about 15 L. 
Sterling per annum.  Tradesmen have 1 s. 8 d. per day, and
some receive more, exclusive of victuals.  The number of
men servants in Kelton, including cotters, of whom there are
30, amounts to about 100.  The female servants are nearly
double that number.

   Mills.-There are three corn mills in the parish, one barley
mill, and one flax mill.  Though flax is not much attended to in
Kelton, the mill is supplied from the neighbourhood around*.

   Lake and Marl.-Near the north corner of the parish,
there is a lake, commonly called The Carlinwark Loch, along
the west side of which runs the military road.  The extent
of this loch, before it was partly drained in the year 1765,
was 116 square acres.  Ten feet of water were then taken off
from it by a cut, or canal, to the water of Dee.  Now it is only
80 square acres in extent.  This loch is one great source of
improvement to Kelton and the neighbourhood.  It contains

land.  About six years ago, the portages received at this office, amounted only to
about 48 or 50 L. Sterling, and did not defray the expence of the establishment.
Now it yields a revenue of 140 L. Sterling per annum, and is still upon the increase.
*The rate of living bears a full proportion to the increase of wages.  It is a
well known fact, that 50 years ago, 50 L. was more than equal to 150 L. now;
so great has been the advance of every article of living.  Provisions etc. of
of all kinds, still continue to rise in their price.
