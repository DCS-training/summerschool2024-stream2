                         Ill.-POPULATION.

	The following is the population of the parish, at different pe-
	riods, within the last fifty years :-
				In 1791, it amounted to 1616
				   1801,	.	1525
                 		   1811,	.	1552
				   1821,	.	1454
	                           1831 	.	1605

    	   The decrease in the period between 1791 and 1811 was mainly
	owing to the enlistment of numbers of the young men in the 42d Regi-
	ment, under the command of their countryman, the late Sir Hector
	Munro of Novar. Between 1811 and 1821, a new system of farm-
	ing was introduced, which sufficiently accounts for the extraordi-
	nary falling off in the numbers. In 1821, when, according to the
	annual increase of 25, the population should have amounted to
	1800, it was found to be only 1454, shewing a falling off to the
	number of 346 persons. During that period, numbers of small
	tenants were ejected in order to make way for farmers from the
	south, possessed of some capital, who, by their superior manage-
	ment, were able to afford higher rents. The more elevated dis-
	tricts of the parish, which were altogether unsuitable for cultivation,
	were converted into sheep-walks; and numbers were thus deprived
	of all means of subsistence, and driven to seek in a foreign land
	for the shelter and protection which were denied them in their own.
	The right of landlords, however, to manage their properties accord-
	ing to their own pleasure, no one will pretend to doubt.
	   As no material changes have occurred since 1831 to affect the
	ordinary increase, the population at present (1839) must amount
	to rather more than 1800. Of these about 500 reside in the vil-
	lage of Evantowin, and the rest in the country. The yearly ave-
	rage of births for the last seven years is about. 40 ; of deaths,15;
	and of marriages, 9. This last average has continued unaltered
	since 1702. The annual number of deaths should properly be no
	more than 12, but the average for the last seven years has been
	raised to 15, by the great mortality in 1834 and 1837. In the
	former of these years, the number of deaths was 23, and in the
	latter no fewer than 28 died, chiefly old and sickly persons, who
	were, cut off by influenza.
   	   During the last three years, there have been 4 illegitimate births
	in the parish.
	   Character, &c. of the People.-The language generally spoken
	is an impure dialect of the Gaelic ; but it is rapidly losing ground.
	In the more Highland parts, it is better understood than English,
