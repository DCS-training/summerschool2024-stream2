              THE REV. JAMES ALLAN, MINISTER.

             I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   THE parish of Newhills, in former times, was a part of the
then extensive and incommodious parish of Saint Machar, or
Old MacHar, whose church is situated in Old Aberdeen.  The
distance betwixt the church and the remote confines towards the
west was so great, that it was hardly possible for the people resi-

religious purposes.  This circumstance had excited, it appears, the
notice and sympathy of a pious and humane individual, Mr George

salvation he took a deep interest,-mortified for the endowment of
a resident clergyman in this western part of Saint Machar the lands
of " Keppelhills," consisting of nearly 700 Scotch acres, which he
had previously purchased from the town of Aberdeen. He also
caused a church to be built upon these mortified lands, about five
miles distant from Saint Machar; and all at his own expense, in
the year 1663.
   This property be disponed and made over to the officiating
clergyman at the time, the Rev. George Melville, and to his suc-
cessors in office in all time coming.  The place of worship, there-

for about three years.
   This benevolent individual also built a large-stone bridge over
the Buxburn, in the line of the old road to Aberdeen, for the ac-
