                         III.--POPULATION.
	The earliest authentic account of the population is contained in a
Statistical Account of Ayrshire, published in 1791, from which it ap-
pears that, in 1755, there were 1497 inhabitants, and in 1790 only
1200. This diminution seems to be accounted for by the fact, that
during the latter period, considerable numbers of the cottars repair-
ed to the manufacturing districts. For it appears from Mr Ains-
lie's tables, that during that period the population in all the ma.
nufacturing villages of the county increased, while it proportion-
ably diminished in the rural districts. Agriculture had not then
made such improvement, as to counterbalance the influence of the
manufacturers. The following table exhibits the state of the po-
pulation in 1831.

and dumb person in the parish.
