                       WISTON AND ROBERTON.                    95

   Parochial Registers.--The books belonging to the kirk-session
of the old parish of Roberton have unfortunately been lost, and
no trace of them can be discovered.  The earliest of those belong-
ing to the old parish of Wiston bears the date of 1694, and with
occassional, but trifling interruptions, they are extant from that pe-
riod to the present.

                       III.--POPULATION.
   The return to Dr Webster in 1755, the earliest account of the
population of the parish that we have been able to discover, gave
from Wiston 591, and from Roberton, 511, in all 1102.  From
a census taken by the writer in the month of February last, it ap-
pears that the present population of the united parish is 949, or
153 less than it was about eighty years ago.  In 1791, the popu-
lation was only 740, or 362 less than it was about forty years be-
fore.  This large decrease was easily accounted for, from the cir-
cumstance, that beween the years 1755 and 1791, the system had
come into vogue of throwing several small farms into one large
farm, and, as a matter of course, driving the small tenants, with
their families, out of the parish; and the very gradual increase
which has since taken place is as easily accounted for on merely na-
tural principles.  There are three villages in the parish, Roberton,
Wiston, and Newton of Wiston.  And from the census taken in
February last, it appears that there were then residing in the vil-
lage of Roberton, 235; in the village of Wiston, 123; in the vil-
lage of Newton, 56; and in what may be called the country parts
of the parish, 535.
   There is no register of deaths kept in this parish.  The births
average from 15 to 20, and the marriages about 7 a year.

   Perhaps it may be worth mentioning,  that a week or two ago,
an aged couple, who, for upwards of half a century had trode
the path of life together, died within a few days of each other;
the husband at the advanced age of 82, and the wife ten years older.
