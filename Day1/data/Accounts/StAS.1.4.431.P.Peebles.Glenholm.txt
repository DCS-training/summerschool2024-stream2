grounds were then parcelled out in smaller possessions; and
this is generally the case throughout this country, especially 
with respect to the sheep farms, as the management of a
sheep farm does not require such a constant superintendance
as renders the residence of the possessor to be necessary;
hence there are many instances of one farmer holding se-
veral farms, and some of them at a considerable distance
from the placen of his residence.  One consequence of this
practice is, that in this way, a sheep farm will let at a high-
er rate than otherwise, as the support of this family
is not to depend wholly on the profits of that one farm.
At present there are 300 souls: was the account to be taken
in the summer season, it would amount to some more,
by the additional number of maid servants, hired for the
purpose of milking ewes, and an addition of herds.  Of
the above 300, 135 are males, 165 are females, 76 are un-
der the age of 10, 72 are from 10 to 20.  The annual a-
verage of births is 9.  So far as can be collected from ob-
servation, the annual average of deaths is 3 or 4 at most.
The annual average of marriages is 2.  There are 10 han-
dicraftsmen, 42 male servants, 24 female, 3 students at the
University of Edinburgh, 14 Seceders, 2 persons who were
born in Jamaica, 158 who were born in other parishes in
Scotland, 44 married men, including widowers, and 18
bachelors, reckoning them from 20 years and upwards.
Marriages have produced 4 children at an average: none
have been obliged to leave the parish for want of employ-
ment.  There are 55 inhabited houses.

   Agriculture, etc.-The land rent is at least L. 1000.  There
are about 5000 sheep, 150 black cattle, 60 horses, 340 bolls
of grain sown, 50 acres is sown grass, 28 acres in turnip,
a part of which are allotted for sheep to pasture on, and
part to fatten cattle for the butcher, with 14 acres of pota-
toes.  The parish is able to supply itself with provisions.
