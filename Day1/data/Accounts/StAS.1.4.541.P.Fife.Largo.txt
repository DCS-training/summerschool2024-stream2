     of Largo.

a spirit of schism has prevailed in this and all the adjacent
parishes.  Clergy abound here.  There being 1 of the E-
stablishment, 1 of the Relief, 1 of the Independents, and 2
of the Anabaptist.  The number of souls belonging to the
Establishment is 1211; belonging to Separatists, including
3 of the Episcopal persuasion, 702.  There are 9 heritors.
-The funds for the public school amount to about L. 30 a-
year.  A man of ability and application may look to this
place as an object, as he would have a numerous school
from the parish, and the safe and healthy situation of the
place would attract boarders from all quarters.-At an ave-
rage, the number of regular poor is 25, each of whom re-
ceives from 2 s. to 4 s. and 5 s. a-month.  The funds a-
mount to from L. 40 to L. 50 a-year, arising from money
at interest, collections at the church-door, and mottcloths.
From this state of the poor, and their provision, it may be
justly observed, that the heritors and tenants, upon whom
the legal support of the poor depends, save annually a con-
siderable sum, on account of the management being vested
in the kirk-session.  Were the heritors to appoint a factor
or treasurer for supplying the poor, were the poor to know
that they are entitled to a legal support, they would soon
discover either their real or fictitious wants, and boldly de-
mand a supply; whereas the present mode of supporting
them is attended with an opposite effect.  By daily fecing
and hearing of collections for the poor, they needy will suf-
fer much, and work hard, before they can think of being
classed among the number; and should this spirit be at last
vanquished, either by distress or poverty, their children and
friends will exert their utmost, to preserve their needy re-
lation from what they think a reproach.  If any at last be-
come beggars, their monthly allowance is immediately
withdrawn, with a view to induce them to return to some
usefulness in society.
