be added, the evident necessity of a little more attention in
rendering the several farms accessible by roads.  It is almost
impossible to conceive how, for centuries, these roads have
been permitted to lie in a state of nature, unpassable to any
stranger without a guide, and often to the inhabitant himself
without much danger, which in a few days the idle shepherd
or farm servant could have repaired.
   The other disadvantage of the parish already hinted, viz.
that of its local situation, must for a long time, and indeed
for ever, in a considerable degree, act as a bar to the improve-
ment of that part of it whose soil is abundantly adapted to
agriculture.  Almost 20 miles distant from lime in every
directions it is not to be wondered that this sort of improve-
ment has been but partially attempted.  The Carlinwark
marl, which is six miles nearer, and which may be brought
up Loch Kenn to the verge of the parish, together with the
original costs and the additional expence of water carriage,
is thought to be a manure of too bulky a kind to be carried
to any distance from the landing place.  On the whole, the
attempts both in lime and marl which have been already
made, have, in themselves, answered the most sanguine ex-
pectations.  Their distance, hitherto, is the only objection to
their general introduction in this neighbourhood.  It is to be
hoped, however, that the conveniency of better roads, which
is fast taking place, together with a higher spirit for farming
in general, will combine to rescue this part of the country
from that supineness under which it has hitherto laboured.
   A great advantage to this neighbourhood are its public
roads.  The two great roads from Wigton to Edinburgh, and
from Carlinwark and the lower parts of this county to Ayr-
shires intersect each other at this point.  But what offers
principal advantage is the road proposed to be opened be-
tween Dumfries and Newtonstewart by this place.  This,
