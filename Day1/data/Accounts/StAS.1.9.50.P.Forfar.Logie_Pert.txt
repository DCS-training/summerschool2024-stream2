when the son of sober and discreet parents inlists to be a
soldier, they give him up in a manner for lost.  Though
the parishioners here in general cannot be charged with
want of oeconomy, or with being more expensive or luxu-
rious than their neighbours, yet it must be acknowledged,
that their mode of living now is widely different from
what it was 30 or 40 years ago.  About that time, except-

general, every farmer has his eight-day clock, and almost
every servant has his watch.-With regard to the style in
