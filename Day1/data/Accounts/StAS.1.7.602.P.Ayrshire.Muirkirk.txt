man body from receiving injury from there circumstances that

   State of Property.-Property has been changing its posses-
sors for some time past, and is still in a fluctuating state.  For-
merly the greater part of the whole parish was divided a-
mong a number of smaller heritors.  But as a gentleman of
extensive fortune has bought the lands of several of them,
the number of proprietors is considerably diminished of late.
The number of these, who reside, does not exceed 4, whose
property is not very extensive.  The non-residing heritors
amount to about 10, including the two principal ones; one
of whom comes into the parish only occasionally, and the
other seldom or never at all.
   The value of property is much increased in this parish
within these few years.  A sheep farm, for instance, which,
a few years ago, was bought for 300 L. within this twelve-
month gave 1000 guineas; and this is by no means dispro-
portioned to the price of other lands lately sold here.  What,
at first sight at least, makes this appear extraordinary is, that
the rise above mentioned is not, as in some like cases, owing
to the advanced improvements of agriculture, or cultivation,
or, indeed, to any material change of the soil in any one re-
spect, but the discovery, and expectation of farther disco-
vering, those useful minerals, which even the most barren
spots cover and contain, and which are so necessary for car-
rying into effect the manufactures lately established here, has
stampt a superlative value on those grounds, on whose sur-
face the traveller was formerly apt to cast his eye with indif-
ference, and sometimes with disgust.
