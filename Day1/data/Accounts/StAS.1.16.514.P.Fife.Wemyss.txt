terwards rises gently to the N.  The shore, from high
water mark outward, is lined with rocks, which are not
high, being mostly covered at high water.

   Climate and Diseases.-Like all the S. and E. shore of
Fife, being much exposed to the E. winds in the spring
months, it is unfavourable to pulmonic complaints, but in
other respects, the climate cannot be said to be unhealthy.
Some of the fishermen are afflicted with calculous con-
cretions: and the reason which they generally assign for
this, is their being so much exposed to cold with wet feet.
Many children die of the small-pox in the natural way.  In
the village of Buckhaven upwards of 30 were lately cut
off.  It is to be hoped, however, that the prejudice against
inoculation will not in future be so general as it has been.
Many persons live to upwards of 80; and within these
two years, 3 persons have died above 90.

   Villages.-Wester Wemyss is a burgh of barony, with
2 bailies, a treasurer, and council.  There are other 3 vil-
lages on the coast, viz. Easter Wemyss, Buckhaven, and
Methil.  There are 2 villages in the country called E.
and W. Coaltowns.

   Soil and Agriculture.-The soil varies both in the coun-
try and on the coast.  In some places it is fine black loam,
in others light and brown, sometimes approaching to sand;
and a small part, particularly in the N. W. corner, is cold
and wet.  It is all arable, and, with a few acres excepted, pro-
duces good crops of wheat, bear, beans, pease, oats, potatoes,
and turnip.  The farmers are, in general, active and in-
dustrious, and attentive to every improvement in agricul-
ture.  In farms near the villages, land is let to trades
people for planting potatoes, who must all afford manure,
