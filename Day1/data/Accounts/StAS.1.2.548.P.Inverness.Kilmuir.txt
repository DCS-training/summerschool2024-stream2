     Statistical Account

The general appearance of the inhabited part of the country
is flat.  The hills, in the lower part of the district, are green,
but the mountains are covered with heath.

   Coast, Fist, etc.-The extent of the sea-coast may be
computed at 30 English miles.  The shores are in general high
and rocky.-There is a great quantity and variety of fish to be
caught on the coast,-such as herrings, cod, ling turbot,
skate, etc. but the fish are caught, not by regular fisherman,
but by the country people, for the use of their families, when
their domestic occupation will permit, and are not sold or sent
to foreign markets.  When a shoal of herrings comes on the
coast, whales of various kinds and magnitudes follow it.
Some seals always frequent the rocks and island, belong-
ing to the parish.-Strong gales from the north-west very fre-
quently throw into several creeks in the parish, great quan-
tities of common sea-weed and tangle.  When this happens
in the months of March and April, the people lay it on their
fields as manure, and it produces an excellent crop of barley.
-There are about 80 tons of kelp made annually from the
sea-weed cut from the rocks.-At the northern extremity of
the parish, there is a high and rocky promontory called Hu-
nish, at the point of wich, there is a most rapid current.
It is believed, that a light-house would be of great service to
mariners at the place, more especially, as it is not far distant
from the dangerous rocks of Sker-na-mile.-There are nume-
rous creeks, in which boats can enter; but only two places,
in which vessels of large burden can anchor with safety. The
first is the harbour of Duntulm, which enjoys the advantage
of most excellent holding ground, and is admirably sheltered
on all quarters, the north-west, perhaps, excepted.  At the
south end of the harbour, which is the proper place for ves-
sels to enter, there are the ruins of the superb castle of Dun-
