   6th, Mr Archibald Denniston was ordained the 30th of March 1649:  He
was deposed by the protesters in 1655, about which deposition Principal Bail-
lie, in his letters, makes the following remark:  He was restored in the year
1661, and died 1679; there is a traditionary anecdote mentioned of him,
which somewhat marks the character of the man.-In the year 1655 he had

when restored, he took up the second, prefacing his discourse, by saying, that
the times were altered, but that the doctrines of the gospel are always the
