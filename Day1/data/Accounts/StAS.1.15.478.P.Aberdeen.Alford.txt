those habits of labour and industry, that have bettered the
condition of the lower classes of people, in other parts of
Scotland; an acquisition which must always and every where
be gradual in its beginnings, and which it is hoped, a few
years will hasten on in this country.
   That predilection and prejudice in favour of ancient modes
of husbandry, which has still some strong roots in this corner,
is not so blameable, as it has been so very general, and exert-
ed itself so vigorously in every country, in the commencement
of improvements; but when fair means are taken to open
the eyes of the people, by examples and indisputable experi-
ments, persevering in them is not so excuseable; and some
degree of this censure must be applied to our farmers, in per-
sisting in their old practices, when they see 10 or 12 bolls of
grain raised by good husbandry, where they could only raise
3 or 4, and excellent crops of turnips and artificial grasses,
where they denied the possibility of producing them.  This
censure, however, is much lets merited than it was, some
years ago; and the operations of a few years more may
change it into applause.

This account cannot be concluded better, than by a paper, found in the
charter chest of Mr Farquharson of Haughton, of a court of the barony of
Alford, during the Usurpation of the Convention Parliament of Scotland.-
The transaction which it records, shews, that the means which they or their
adherents (for the then proprietor of the barony was a most zealous cove-
nanter) employed, to supply their treasury, maintain their forces, and sup-
port their power, were not very dissimular to those that have been so recent-
ly and tyrannically put in practice in a neighbouring Kingdom; for when
the low state of agriculture, the general poverty of the country, and the flen-
der means of the commonalty, at that time, are contrasted, with the heavi-
ness of the taxation imposed, and the severity of the regulations for enfor-
cing payment, it is well entitled to be compared to a forced loan.
   It furnishes a strong proof, that in this, as in every other country, arbitrary
exactions have followed hard, after the fall of equitable government; and it
is a striking example of the burdens and oppressions which, when lawful
authority is overturned, must be born, not only by the rich and the great,
