     of Maxton.

memory of which, a tomb stone was erected upon her grave,
in the field of battle, with this inscription:

     'Fair maiden LILLIARD lies under this stane,
     'Little was her stature, but great was her fame;
     'On the English lads she laid many thumps
     'And when her legs were off, the fought upon her stumps.' 

   Some remains of this tomb stone are still to be seen.  It is
near a Roman causeway, or road, which runs through the pa-
rish of Maxton, about two miles, and goes southward to-
wards the foot of Jed water, and northward toward the foot
of Eildon hills, on the west side.
