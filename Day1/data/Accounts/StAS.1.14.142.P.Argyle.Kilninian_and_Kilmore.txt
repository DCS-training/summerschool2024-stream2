mild than in the inland parts of Scotland.  The ground
is seldom wholly covered with snow; nor are the frosts
of any long continuance; but our summers are often to
be complained of, as too rainy and cold, and of short con-
tuinuance.  Yet the climate, upon the whole, is not unfa-
vourable to health; many persons live to the age of be-
tween 80 and 90, and a few have exceeded 90 years
who died in the present incumbent's time.  The most
common distempers are, colds, rheumatisms, and a
pain in the breast, or pit of the stomach; all of which
may, perhaps, be attributed to poverty of diet

   Roads and Bridges, &c.-The roads through this pa-
rish are, in many parts, very bad, and the improvement
of them proceeds but slowly.  This may be partly the
fault of proprietors, who pay much less attention to the
making of proper roads, than the importance of such im-
provement deserves.  But the frequency of hills, great
or small, as also of rocks or mosses, which occur on most
of the lines of roads in this country, is the principal ob-
struction.  The fund allowed, and the money collected for
roads and bridges, is so disproportionate to the extent
and surface, and to the epense requisite for overcoming
these natural impediments, that it will take many, many
years, before they can be brought to any tolerable per-
fection.  At present, there is but one bridge in the whole
parish, though there are many torrents intersecting the
roads, which a few hours of heavy rain will render im-
passable, till the sky clears again.  Another bridge is
