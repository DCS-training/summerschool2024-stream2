   Miscellaneous Observations.-This parish lay formerly
under disadvantages, which are now, in a great measure,
removed, by means of inclosures and good road.-There
are 3 old castles, the most remarkable of which is called
Barbiston.  A battle is said to have been fought between
Dick of Barbiston and Kennedy, the latter of whom was
killed.  And from the stone which killed him, the place
is reported to have been called Barbarous Stone, or Barbi-
ston.  Some stones of the old vaults were found, and bear
the dates of 1340 and 1345.  A spear, and several large
bones, which dissolved when exposed to the air, were also
found near this spot.-The price of provisions has increased
much within these few years.  A day's wages for a labou-
rer in husbandry, are generally from 10 d. to 1 s. 5 d. the
day.  The wages of a common labourer, when married,
are from L. 3 to L. 3 10 s. in the half year, and are found
little enough to bring up a family.  The fuel commonly
used in coal and peat.  Very little wood is used.  The
price of coal and peat is nearly the same, from 4 d. to
6 d. the load.  The people in general are disposed to in-
dustry and are economical.
