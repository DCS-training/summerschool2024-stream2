the joint contributions of the inhabitants, without the smallest
assistance from the heritors.  These have hitherto supplied all
demands, and none were ever known to beg.  The elders are
so attentive to the distressed, that they have seldom any occasion
to call for assistance; and there is no distinction made, whether
they belong to the Establishment or not.  Besides supplying
the ordinary poor, the kirk-session are always ready to ac-
commodate industrious persons, who have met with any un-
foreseen misfortunes, or who are unable to work, with small
sums, to be returned on a change of circumstances.  This
practice is attended with happy consequences, not only to the
persons thus relieved, but to the public; and it is found to
be a most effectual method of advancing the interest of virtue
and industry.
