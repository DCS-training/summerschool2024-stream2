been the metropolitan church of the whole island of
Sky.
   Several vestiges of druidical temples are to be met with,
and some of them pretty entire.  There are also duins, all of
a circular form, and built without either lime or mortar.
These duins or towers are thought to be Danish, and were
used as garrisons, or rather watch towers, or perhaps both;
what makes the latter probable, is, that from each of these
towers, another is seen from either hand; and when any one
was alarmed at the approach of a hostile train, a signal could
be immediately made, (perhaps by fire or smoke), which
being soon discovered by those who were next in sight, they
could instantly repeat the signal; and thus the whole inha-
bitants of the country capable of bearing arms, might in a
very short time be collected and armed to repel the common
enemy.
   Many cairns or heaps of small stones thrown together are
to be seen.  In these cairns are contained urns, wherein the
ashes of some renowned chiefs who fell in the field of battle,
are deposited; in one of these lately dug up, was found a
large stone chest or coffin, made of four stones, its dimen-
sions were about five feet long, by four and a half broad; up-
on the layer, which is a large single stone of nearly six feet
by five, and a foot and a half thick, was found the handle of
some weapon, resembling much the hilt of a small sword, but
quite corroded with rust; and a pin which seemed to be com-
pound metal, about seven inches long, somewhat rounder
than a pretty large probe, at the one end flat and broad, and
the other round and sharp pointed.  Within the coffin was an
urn of burnt clay, nicely carved, yet without any inscription;
the urn being broke by the tools employed in removing the
layer, none of the contents were discovered.  Other urns of a
similar kind have been formerly dug up in this district.
