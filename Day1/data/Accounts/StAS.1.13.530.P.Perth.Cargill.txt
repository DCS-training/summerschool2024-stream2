surface diversified by wood and water, and variegated by
ascents and declivities.  Rising gradually in the form of a 
ridge for about a mile from the river Tay, which bounds
it on the N. it reaches a plain of near 2 miles in breadth,
which, with some unevennesses, it preserves till it comes to
the Sidla hills, which bound it on the S. Excepting the wood-
lands, it is mostly all arable; and if improvements go on
as they are doing at present, it will be soon all under cul-
tivation, and laid out in regular enclosures.  The soil is ex-
tremely various and different.  In the lower part of the
parish, along the banks of the river, it is a wet mortary
clay, which produces strong crops; inclining as you rise in
elevation to a rock marl, which is cold and unproductive.
The level grounds on the top of the ridge are partly loamy
and partly moorish.  Towards the foot of the hills the soil
is a light dry gravel.

   The air is extremely pure and salubrious.  Owing to
the rapid course of the river, the high elevation and va-
ried position of the grounds, it has at all times a free and
strong circulation, and is hurt by none of those noxious
damps, which prove so detrimental in low lying grounds.
Accordingly the inhabitants are in general stout and
healthy, and many of them live to a very advanced old age.
Not to mention many who are upwards of 80, it is wor-
thy of remark, that the late Duchess of Perth lived here
without an ailment, to her 90th year; and there is now
residing in the parish a Lady of Quality born in the last
century, who has still the entire use of all her faculties, 
enjoys life as much as she did at 20; and to the wisdom
of age, adds all the chearfulness, and much of the gaiety
of youth.  If there be any particular disease more preva-
lent in this parish than others, it is the consumption and
rheumatism; and these are probably owing to the seden-
tary life of many of the inahabitants, who are weavers, and
