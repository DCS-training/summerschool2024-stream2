			III.--POPULATION.
		In 1801, the population w`s             980
		   1811,                               1204
		   1821,                               1248
		   1831,                               1220
	The decrease during the last twelve years has been occasioned

the proprietors to continue this practice, as the present cottars die
out or remove.

trious, strictly honest, and abundantly comfortable and contented
with their situation and circumstances. Oatmeal pottage, with
milk, is the general breakfast of the peasantry and of the younger

supper.

acres under wood, 350 in meadow, and 1647 which never have
been cultivated. Of the last there may be a few acres, perhaps,
