them by common day-labourers.  Unfortunately, however,
more than one third of these houses may be called gin, or
rather whisky shops, as they all fell that pernicious liquor.  What
effects this must have upon the morals of the people, not
only in the village, but in the neighbourhood, may be 
foreseen.

   Air and Climate.-The climate is mild and temperate,
and the air falubrious.  Many of the inhabitants live to a
very considerable age.  The ministers of Kirkcolm have,
in particular, been distinguished by longevity.  In 1643,
Mr James Bell was settled minister, and held the cure,
with some interruption when Episcopacy was established
in Scotland, until the year 1700.  His successor, Mr. Mar-
shall, possessed the charge until 1705, when the present in-
cumbent was admitted; who, in April 1791, was on the verge
of eighty.

   There are no mineral or medicinal wells in this parish,
and the holy wells, that, in times of ignorance, were such
objects of superstitious veneration, are now treated with con-
tempt and ridicule.

   Antiquities.-This parish furnishes no antiquities, but
the ruins of an old building, which has been large and
capacious.  Tradition has not so much as preserved the
name of the founder or its inhabitants.  It is only certain, that
it has not been habitable for above a century.-It may be
proper to add, that, in digging among the ruins some months
ago, a small cannon was found, seven feet long, and about
three inches in the bore.  This circumstance tends to prove,
in addition to the thickness of the walls, that it was built
as a place of strength for the protection of the neighbouring
country.
