     Statistical Account

   School.-There is an established schoolmaster, with a salary
of no more than 100 merks Scotch, which is by far too
small, as he enjoys no other advantage whatever, except the
wages he receives from his scholars, together with the emo-
luments of session clerk and precentor: He is obliged to
rent his dwelling house and garden.  The heritors pay rent
for a school-house.  As the most populous parts of the pa-
rish are at the distance of four miles, it is very inconvenient
for young children to attend the public school.  Private
schools are therefore kept in these parts of the parish.

   Population.-As this article is most important and essential
in statistical accounts, it demands peculiar attention.  There
has been preserved an old session register, conducted with
great exactness, from 1611 to 1661, and from 1694 to the
present day.  The following is an extract from Dr Webster's
account of the population in 1755: `The number of souls
`in Kirkoswald is 1168, number of fighting men from the
`age of 18 to 56 is 233.'  From these, and a careful inspec-
tion and visitation of the parish in 1791 and 1792, the po-
pulation of the parish at different periods may be ascertained.
On the ninth of February 1640, the solemn league and
covenant was sworn to, and subscribed by the inhabitants of
this parish.  The original was deposited in the hands of the
minister, Mr John Burne, and a copy inserted in the records
of the kirk session.  This copy is still extant.  From it we
learn that the parish contained precisely 300 males, who
were disposed and qualified to engage in this transaction.
Fifty-eight, including the minister, subscribed their own
names;-242, with their hands at the pen, authorised pu-
blic notaries to subscribe for them.  Supposing the numbers
who subscribed to comprehend only the males above 20,
the population at that time must have been little inferior to
