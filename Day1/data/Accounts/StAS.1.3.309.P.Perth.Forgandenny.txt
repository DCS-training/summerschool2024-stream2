miles on each side, through the Ochills to Fife.  It is there-
fore imagined by some, that it might have been an outpost
of the Romans, whilst they were in Strathearn.  Beside
Ardargie, a village in the hills, there is a place, which for time
immemorial has been called the Roman Camp.  It is situated
upon a height above the May.  Its figure is a square, each
side of which is about 90 yards in length.  On the one side
it is defended by a deep hollow, through which runs a
brook; and on the other three sides by trenches.  The
width of these trenches, at the top, is about 10 yards, their
depth on the side next the camp about 14 feet, and on the
outside 10. Somewhat more than a mile south from For-
gan, is a place called Castle-law.  It is situated upon the
summit of a very high hill, which resembles a low cone.
The circumference of its area is about 500 yards.  This spot
is defended on all sides by a stone wall, the vestiges of which
are yet to be seen; these vestiges are of a form nearly circu-
lar, and the walls seem to have taken their form from the
top of the hill on which they were built.  Besides this wall,
there are also several outworks, which seem to have been
formed for defence; particularly on the south, where the
hill is less steep, and the ground below higher, there are
three mounds of earth parallel to the wall, and to each o-
ther.  Within the area of this castle or fortification, are the
vestiges of buildings; and there was erected, by the former
Lord Ruthven, on this spot, a sort of half tower, which is
yet standing.  This place commands a prospect of the coun-
try, to the mouth of the Tay, or the German ocean on the
east, all Strathearn to the Grampian mountains on the west,
a great part of Perthshire and Angushire on the north and
north east, and the top of the Lomond hills on the south.
The general opinion concerning Castle-law is, that it had
been a Danish fortification.  About half a mile north from
