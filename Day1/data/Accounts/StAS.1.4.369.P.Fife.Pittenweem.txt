The extent of the parish is about an English mile and a

bounded by the parish of Anstruther-Wester on the E.;

in the parish are flat; the soil is in general black and
loamy, and very fertile; the air is dry and healthy; the
water remarkably soft, while that of the neighbouring
towns is hard and brackish.  The most prevalent distemper
