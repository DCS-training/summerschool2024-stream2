                   MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
     Since the publication of the former Statistical Account, the po-
pulation has nearly doubled, and the rent of the parish has increas-
ed from L.6350 to L.17,712.  A great extend ofmoss waste
land has been brought under cultivation.  New roads have been
formed, and the old ones greatly improved.  Several hundred acres
of land have been planted, and are now thriving plantations. Fur-
row-draining has been most extensively practised.  Improved farm
steadings* have been erected, and are still increasing.  Improved
implements of husbandry have been introduced; iron ploughs have
entirely superseded those ofwood; and the old cumbrous stone
cheese-presses have given place to the iron lever press, a portable
and neatly contructed article.
     The Ardrossan canal was destined to have passed through this
parish.  But having been finished only from Glasgow to John-
stone, an act of Parliament was obtained in 1825, to complete the
communication from Johnstone to Ardrossan by a rail-road. It has
only, however, been carried from Ardrossan to Kilwinning.  As it
would have passed, had it been completed, for six miles through
Dalry, intersecting extensive fields of coal, limestone, and free-
stone, it would have proved of essential benefit to the parish.  A
survey was lately taken of a rail-road fromGlasgow to Ayr by Dal-
ry, for which the requisite funds have been subscribed.  It is pro-
bable, therefore, that this parish will ere long enjoy the advantages
of this mode of communication.
