renders it in a great measure abortive.  As the soil is chiefly
moss, and becomes dry by draining, great numbers of moles
work among the drains and throw up a black mould, which,
if allowed to lie undispersed, produces a coarse kind of grass
very unhealthy for sheep.  The next step, therefore, after
draining, is to catch the moles.  At first sight, this appears
an endless talk.  But experience hath shown, that it is neither
so tedious nor so expensive as at first sight may appear.  Some
of the farmers have accomplished it, and find the
happiest effects from it.  Proposals have been made to clean
the whole parish for 3 d. the pound rent the first five years,
and for 1 d., or 1 1/2 d. ever after.  Plantations would also be a
great improvement, not only for beautifying the country, but
also for sheltering the stocks in times of storm.  There has
been a report, that two new roads are to be made, which
would be very beneficial to this parish.  The one is from the
church (where the road from Dumfries ends) to Hawick,
either by Borthwick water; or by Glendinning and Tiviot
