                         PARISH OF TRANENT.

                  PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND
                                    TWEEDDALE.

                   THE REV. JOHN HENDERSON, A.M. MINISTER.

	I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE etymology of the word Tranent, or, as it was an-
ciently written, Travernent, is involved in some obscurity; but we
must reject, as altogether fanciful, its derivation from the circum-
stance of a party of Danes having landed on the opposite coast of
Fife, and being repulsed by the natives, who exultingly exclaimed,
Tranent! Tranent! "Let them swim over." Neither are there
any better grounds for attributing it to a corruption of the word
"Trinity." The explanation of Chalmers * is much more satis-
factory, that it took its name from its natural situation. The
oldest part of the village stood along the edge of a ravine, once
finely wooded, and in the ancient British language, Trev-er-nent
is said to signify a village on a ravine or river, which is exactly
descriptive of its site,-the ravine or glen, through which a small
stream runs, being immediately to the west of the oldest houses.
   Boundaries and Extent.-The parish is bounded on the north,
by the Frith of Forth; on the east, by the parishes of Gladsmuir
and Pencaitland; on the south, by Ormiston and Cranstoun; and
on the west, by Inveresk and Prestonpans. Its greatest length
from north-east to south-west is about 5 miles, and its extreme
breadth, 3 miles. Its area is about 9 square miles, or 5464 acres,
1 rood, 16 falls imperial. Its former extent was much greater,
as will be noticed under its Civil History.
   Topographical Appearance.-The surface of the ground slopes
gradually, with gentle undulations from the southern boundary of
the parish, towards the sea;-its greatest elevation being about
320 feet above the level of the Firth of Forth. The parish is
