   Ecclesiastical State.-The ancient name of the parishes of North
and South Knapdale when united, was Kilvicocharmaig.  They
were disjoined about the year 1730.  By the deed of disjunction
the minister of this parish was appointed to preach alternately at
Achoish and Inverneill, and every sixth Sunday at Tarbert.
About the year 1775, a mission was established at Tarbert by the
Committee for the management of the Royal Bounty, comprehend-
ing the south part of South Knapdale, and the north part of the
parish of Kilcalmonell.  A church was then built at Tarbert, and a
missionary appointed to preach there every Sabbath.  Thus (ex-
cept during vacancies) the minister of South Knapdale was relieved
from preaching at that station.  But in terms of the deed of disjunc-
tion, he continued to officiate alternately at Inverneill and Achoish
until the year 1829, when, in consequence of the annexation of the
north part of the parish to the quoad sacra parish of Loehgilphead
and the smallness of the congregation that was to attend pub-
lic worship at Inverneill, he was directed and authorized by the
Presbytery to preach there every third Sabbath, and at Achoish
two Sabbaths successively.
   There are two churches in the parish, the one at Achoish near
the manse, the other at Inverneill, six xniles distant.  The road
between the two churcher is excessively hilly, ill lined, and not
kept in good repair.  Both churches were built about the same
time, in the year 1775.  A few years ago, they were seated and
are in tolerable repair.  Including the communion table seats, they
contain 25O sitter each.  In the church at Achoish, there are no
