stricted to the parish, and that part of it, amounting to a full
third, which forms the property of Mr Gordon.  The old ortho-
graphy was "Fyvin," in correspondence with the etymology al-
ready assigned.  It seems to have been a royal park down to
the time of Robert II., and the castle was no doubt a royal
hunting-seat.  In 1325, mention is made of the "King's Park
of Fyvin."  Between 1370 and 1380, it was given by Robert
II., to his eldest son, John, then Steward of Scotland, and af-
terwards king by the title of Robert III.  He soon resign-
ed it in favour of his cousin-german, Sir James Lindesay.  It
was acquired by the Prestons in 1390; by the Meldrums about
1440; by the Setons in 1596; and by the present family, the
Gordons, in 1726. *
   Eminent Citaracters.-Reginald le Chen or Cheyne.-This dis-
tinguished person was proprietor of the lands of Ardlogy and
Leuchendy, which he gave to the Priory of Fyvie, in connection
with the Abbey of Arbroath, in 1285.  He is generally styled
Pater, to distinguish him from his son of the same name.  He was
Baron Of lnverugie, Strabrock, &c. and Great Chamberlain of
Scotland from 1267 to 1269.  He was one of the Magnates
Scotie who concurred in settling the succession to the crown
on Margaret of Norway, grand-daughter to Alexander III., in
1284.  He was one of the barons who addressed Edward I.
on the subject of a marriage between the young Queen of Scot-
land and the Prince of Wales, with the view of uniting the king-
doms, in 1289.  He made his submission to Edward I, at Aber-
deen, on the 17th July 1296, and his name is found in the Rag-
man Roll.  Of this ancient family of Cheyne of Inverugie came
Henry le Chen or Cheyne, Bishop of Aberdeen from 1281 to
1329. +
   James de Lindesay.-He was the ninth in descent of the fami-
ly of Crawfurd, and is designed "Dominus de Crawfurd et Bu-
chan."  He was nearly connected with the royal family, his
mother being Egidia, sister to Robert II.  He was present at
the coronation of his uncle at Scone 1371; and he was a com-
missioner to treat with the English in 1374 and 1381.   About
1380, he became proprietor of Formartine, on the resignation
of his cousin John, afterwards Robert III; and in 1382, was
