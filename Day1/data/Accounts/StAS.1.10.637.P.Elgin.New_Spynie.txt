     of Spynie

   Advantages.-One great advantage, which this parish in a
peculiar manner enjoys, is the abundance of stone so well
adapted both for building and inclosing; of which, however,
the inhabitants have not yet availed themselves in any great
degree.  Besides this, no part of the parish is inconvenient-
ly distant from either of the harbours of Loffiemouth or
Findhorn, or the markets of Elgin, to which last there is at
all times an uninterrupted access by a handsome stone bridge,
where the post-road to Forres crosses the Lossie, about the
middle of the south side of the parish.

   Language.-The language of the parish is the Scotch dia-
lect.  Some of the names of places are evidently Gaelic,
such as Kintrae, Inshagarty*, (Innis-ant shagairt), the Leggat,
(an lag-shad), etc.  And it is highly probable that many
more of them are of Gaelic origin, though they are now
corrupted or disguised so much, by having been so long in
the mouths of Lowlanders, that it is hardly possible for a
Highlander to recognize them for his native tongue.

   Character, etc.-The people are industrious and frugal, pos-
sessing also other virtues, not so much the necessary conse-
quence of their situation; being in general honest, benevo-
lent and friendly, and entertaining a high respect for the
ordinances of religion.  The dress of the poorer tenants and
day-labourers is of the cheapest kind, chiefly of home ma-
nufacture; that of the more substantial farmers, and their
servants, is purchased from the shops of Elgin.
