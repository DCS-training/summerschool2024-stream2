   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The parish is totally
free from the baneful consequences of religious controversy.
Some years ago there were a few Episcopalians; but these
now join in communion with those of the Established
Church.  The name of Seceder is unknown.  The
justices of peace, in the district, hold regular quarterly
meetings, for the purpose of deciding differences among
their tenants.  One obvious good effect of this measure is,
to put a speedy end to their disputes, and to save them the
heavy expence of attending the tedious proceedings of a
sheriff-court, at the distance of 30 miles.  Thre parish en-
joys the benefit of good roads, and an easy access to the
low country, and to the nearest market towns, Dunkeld
and Perth.  A few farms are still intermixed together, in
the way called run-ridge; that is, the ridges of arable land
belong alternately to different tenants, a most incommo-
dious and absurd arrangement.  Much time and labour is
spent in procuring fuel, and lost to agriculture.  This dis-
advantage is yearly increasing, because the mosses which
used to supply the people with peat, are in some parts
exhausted, and those which remain, either lie at a greater
distance, or are of more difficult access.  Some parts of the
parish must soon labour under a scarcity of fuel, an incon-
venience which will not easily be remedied; for coal is at
a great distance, there is no water carriage, wood is dear,
and wood plantations neither extensive nor much advanced
in growth.  One cause which accelerates a scarcity of fuel,
is the distilling of whisky; for one still consumes as much
peat as would serve five families.

   Distilleries, Alehouses, etc.-There are 2 licensed stills of
30 gallons each in the parish, and 24 licensed retailers of ale,
beer, and other exciseable liquors.  The number of distillers
