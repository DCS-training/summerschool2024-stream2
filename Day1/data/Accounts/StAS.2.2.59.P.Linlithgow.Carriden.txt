   There are several dikes that throw the strata up, partly to the
south, but generally to the north. These dikes vary from one to
twenty fathoms, running chiefly from south-east to north-west,
and may be termed slips rather than dikes, as they seldom occa-
sion any rise, and merely disjoin the metals without producing
much alteration in their relative position. To the east of Burn-
foot, after passing the crop of the Carsy coal, it is thought that
no coal is to be found. No attempt by boring has been made to
ascertain what minerals exist beneath the surface; but it is sup-
posed that the strata lie beneath the coal measures.  It is a cu-                    
rious fact, that in a district where so many seams of coal occur,
whinstone should be found so abundant. The Irongath hills
consist of hard whinstone, resting on the coal strata; nor does it
present itself only in crops on the to of eminences, but is found
in regular seams between, and sometimes even in actual contact
with the coal. In these hills, there is a bed of coal, varying from
one to eight or ten feet in thickness, which has whinstone both
for its roof and pavement; and between the western main coal
and the red coal, the seam of whinstone is about 70 feet thick.
The fossil remains that have been found in the coal formation
consist of reeds of different kinds. Shells and impressions of
leaves are also of more or less frequent occurrence; and a few
years ago, the workmen fell in with a beautiful specimen of that
curious extinct genus of fossil plants, the lepidodendron, but, un-
