grounds, burning the heath, or any brush-wood which can
be collected about the stocks, is found to have an excellent
effect.  After the woods are cut, they are, for 5 or 6 years,
carefully preserved from cattle.  At that period, at 10 or 12,
and at 15 or 16 years of age, they are weeded or cleared
from broom, briars, or whatever else is prejudicial to them,
and properly thinned.  The first weeding is much for the
benefit of the wood, but makes no immediate returns to the
proprietor.  The hoops got at the second will bear about one
fourth of the expence; and at the third, will do something
more than clear the whole.  Trees of every kind thrive in
this country amazingly.  An oak in the Bandry wood 96
years old, is 7 feet 3 inches in girth two feet above the
ground, has in its trunk, which is 21 feet high, 45 solid feet
of timber, and is computed to have 4 bolls of bark.  Ano-
ther oak near the house of Camstraddan, which is about 80
years old, is 7 feet 2 inches in girth two feet above the
ground, has in its trunk 36 feet of solid timber, and is com-
puted to have 2 1/2 bolls of bark.  But the trees of the great-
est size in this parish are at Rosedoe.  A yew tree there, at
the height of 2 1/2 feet above the ground is 12 1/2 feet, and a
sycamore, at the same height, 13 1/2 feet in girth.  Their age
is uncertain.
   The natural woods of this country consist of oak, ash, yew,
holly, mountain ash, birch hazel, aspen, alder, crab, haw-
thorn, and willows.  Oaks shive only in dry ground.  Ashes
abound on the banks of the lake and near rills of water.
Yews are rarely found but in the islands.  Hollies are scat-
tered through the woods, and mountain ashes often grow in
elevated situations.  The remaining kinds are less valuable,
and frequently, therefore, distinguished by the name of bar-
ren timber.  The other indigenous plants are nearly the same
as in other parts of the Highlands, in similar soils and situa-
