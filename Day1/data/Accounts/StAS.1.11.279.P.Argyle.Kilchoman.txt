   Horses.-We are said to keep too many horses, which is a-
gainst the system of black cattle: Yet these horses bring a good
deal of money into the country, the Irish being very fond of
them, as they are neat lively creatures, and fit for the saddle.
Our manner of husbandry requires also a good many horses, 4
being yoked in each plough; and peats, corn, and fulzie car-
ried home on horseback.  As the country is champaign, and
the roads good, an Islayman will scarce stir from home with-
out his pad.

   Sheep.-It is much to be wished, we had got more into the
rearing of sheep than we have, as the country would answer
them well; and the higher lands would be excellent sheep
walks, being green to the top, and there being no foxes or other
vermin to destroy them.  The tenantry content themselves,
however, with rearing no more than serves their own families:
Hence mutton and wool sell high.

   Population.-By a late enumeration, the number of inha-
bitants in this parish amounts to 2300
The population in 1755 is uncertain.  Dr. Webster says,
that the island of Islay contained then only the two parishes
of Killarow and Kildalton; under which, it is probable, that
Kilmenie and Kilchoman were included.  We are enabled,
however, to state the exact increase of population in the
whole island; as the total number of people in Islay, at

present, amounts to above                    9500
From which deducting the return, in   
   1755, from Killarow,               1761
And that from Kildalton,              3583   5344
                                             ----
The total increase in the island is          4156
