weaknesses.  On Catlaw, and the adjoining mountains,
partly green, and partly heath, there is excellent pasture
for sheep; and Catlaw mutton is remarkable for its supe-
rior delicacy and flavour.  There is but little flat land; al-
most the whole of it sloping gently with a north or south
exposure.  The climate is nearly the same throughout the
whole parish, and any variation is owing to exposure and
local situation.  Along the braes of Balfour and Baldovie,
lying to the south, and sheltered with a rising ground on
the north, the air is rather milder and more temperate
than in any other part of the parish; and both spring
and harvest somewhat earlier.  The air, however, in gene-
ral is cold and sharp, yet extremely healthy; and to the
salubrity of the air and the water, it may probably be ow-
ing that agues never make their appearance.  The preva-
sent diseases are fevers, colds, fore throats, and consump-
tions.

   Soil, Produce, and Rent.-The soil is various: In some
places it is a kind of clay, cold and wet; in others a light
sand; but in general is a rich black mould.  The principal
crops are barley and oats.  Of late years wheat has been
raised in particular places, especially in the braes of Kenny
and Baldovie, with great success.  Turnip and potatoes,
clover and rye grass, are common in every part of this pa-
rish.  A small quantity of pease is sown chiefly for fodder,
and on every farm more or less flax seed, for domestic uses.
More grain is raised than is consumed by the inhabitants;
a part of their barley is bought by a distiller in the parish,
and the remainder, with the oats, wheat, and meal, are
carried to the Dundee and the Kirrimuir markets.  Both
spring and harvest are later than in the vale of Strathmore,
to the south, owing to more frequent showers among the
hills, and to a kee¤er air in the narrow openings between
