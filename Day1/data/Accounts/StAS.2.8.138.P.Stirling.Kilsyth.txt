                          PARISH OF KILSYTH.

         PRESBYTERY OF GLASGOW, AND SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR.

                  THE REV. WILLIAM BURNS, MINISTER.


        I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name.--ANCIENTLY, Monaebrugh was the name of this parish,
supposed to be a compound of Monaugh, hilly, and Ebrugh, streams;
and the name is very descriptive of the eastern district of this parish,
which, till 1649, constituted the whole parish. At that period, what
is called the West Barony was disjoined from Campsie, and added
to Moniabrugh, * or the East Barony,which continued to be the name
of the parish till about a hundred years ago, when the whole pa-
rish was more usually designated Kilsyth. The Rev. James Robe,
who was ordained minister of Kilsyth in the year 1713, and wrote
his "Narrative" in 1743, speaks of the parish "Kilsyth, till
lately called Moniabroch." The oldest set of tokens, so late as
the year 1755, have MK stamped upon them, doubtless "Moni-
brugh Kirk;" and the communion cups, 1731, are marked "For
the Kirk of Monaebrugh." Thus, in solemn affairs, the older name
was longer retained than in common usage. The estate of Living-
stone, Viscount of Kilsyth, tbe "great proprietor of the district,
when the West and East Baronies were both included in the same
parish, naturally gave name to the parish. I conjecture that the name

<FOOTNOTE>The spelling in the records is always Moniabrugh.
