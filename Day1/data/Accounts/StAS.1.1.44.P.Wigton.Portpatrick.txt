   Besides the castle imported here, There are also consider-
able number sent from Beltfast, Bangor, Newry, &c.  directly
to England.  The English coal vessel always take back cattle
from Ireland when they have it in their power; but it is believ-
ed that largest import is at Portpatrick.  The great ex-
tent of sea by any other passage, especially in the winter sea-
son, is much against the safe and successful transportation
of a cargo, so perishable in itself, and liable to so many acci-
dents.

   This trade depends so much upon the quantity of grass, of
hay, and of turnips in England, and sometimes even upon the 
prospect of large crops of these articles, that there is much
speculation in it.  Great gains and great losses are, therefore,
sudden and frequent.  Hence the import is unequal.  Some
people suppose that the trade is favourable to smuggling,

black cattle are bred; and there seems to be rather a hard-
ship in permitting such numbers of cattle to be imported in-
to North Britain, or even carried through it, in order to rival
the productions of the very country, in the only market to
which it has access.  Without entering, However, into these 
speculations, it may be sufficient at present to remark, that
the import will probably diminish of itself, in consequence
of the rapid progress which ireland is now making.  The
time is fast approaching, when that kingdom will be in the

within itself sufficient for the consumption of its own pro-

other commodities, besides cattle.  The Irish are rapidly im-
