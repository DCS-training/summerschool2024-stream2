lands.  There is no great deal of natural wood in this parish,
that of any extent is upon the estate of Kilcoy, consisting of
alder, and is kept with great care and attention.  There are
very large plantations of firs of various kinds, ash, beech, oak
etc., on the estates of several of the heritors; but the most
extensive, is that on the estate of Bellmaduthy, being above
500 acres, all in a thriving condition, and many of them fit
for market. By the time all these plantations come to per-
fection, or are fit for sale, there will be great abundance of
wood for supplying the parishioners with timber and fuel, an
article much wanted here, as the mosses in the parish are
quite exhausted, and the inhabitants will be necessitated to
purchase coals, which, with the high duty, is far beyond the
reach of the poorer, and middle class of people, and which,
if not speedily withdrawn, will oblige the inhabitants to emi-
grate to other countries, where fire is to be had in greater a-
bundance.  Every poor man's countenance here sparkled with
joy, at being told of Mr. Secretary Dundas's intention of
bringing a bill this session into Parliament, to take the duty off
coals coming to this country.

   Antiquities.-There are evident marks of a battle's being
fought in this parish.  It is said to have been between the peo-
ple of Inverness and the M'Donalds, an to have happened
in the 13th or 24th century.  The plain on which this bat-
tle was fought, is to this day called Blair-na-coi; a name
given it from this particular circumstance, that as one of the
contending parties was giving way and flying, a tenant and
his son who were ploughing on that field, had taken off the
yokes with which the oxen were fastened together, rallied the
rooted troops, and with them recommenced the action and
carried the day*.
