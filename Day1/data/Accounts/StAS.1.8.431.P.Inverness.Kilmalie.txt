perty it is.  It is in a thriving way, and with their court.,
tenance and patronage, is likely to become a distinguised place.

   Fort-William-Stands upon the south side of a small gulph
of that arm of the sea, called Locheile; where, by the turn of
the mountains, it forms itself into an angle, and receives the
rivers Lochy and Nevis.  It is situated upon a plain, almost
level with the sea.  Upon the opposite shore, there is another
of a much larger extent, upon the same level, which widens,
and exceedingly beautifies the prospect.  These plains are
surrounded with mountains, which were once covered with
woods, and are watered with many springs and rivulets.
   The fort was first built during the usurpation of Oliver
Cromwell, by the advice and direction of Monk.  It occupied
more ground at that time than it does now, and consisted of
2,000 effective troops.  Colonel Braym was the first, I be-
lieve, who was appointed governor.  The fort was then dis-
tinguished by the name of the "Garrison of Inverlochy."-
In the time of King William, it was rebuilt, on a less scale,
with stone and lime.  In the year 1746, it stood a siege of
5 weeks, which commenced 24th February, and was raised
3d April following, with the lots only of 6 men killed,
and 24 wounded *.  The fort is, by no means, a place of
strength, For there two years past, all the men in it have
been only a company of invalids.  Besides, some years ago,
about a fourth part of the wall was undermined, and swept
away by the river Nevis:  It has ever since been fast going to
ruin, and there appears not the most distant prospect of its
being repaired.  General James Murray is the present go-
vernor of the fort; Lord Forbes is deputy-governor; and
