	This parish affords but little scope for the husbandry of
sheep. About 320, however, are generally kept throughout the
year by gentlemen and farmers, who keep them partly for do-
mestic purposes, but chiefly for enriching their fields. The kinds
kept are various. The proprietors of the parish usually keep
in their lawns a small mixed flock of the Linton, South Down,
and Merino breeds, which in summer are subsisted on grass,
and in winter, partly on grass, and partly on turnips, hay, and
straw; and, from the excellent shelter afforded them, they thrive
uncommonly well, and are generally very productive. Some
of the farmers keeping sheep, particularly in winter, more for
the market than for family use, generally keep the Linton, Che-
viot, and Leicester breeds. In summer, such as keep them,
graze them in their enclosures; and in winter, when the great-
est stock is kept, after drawing the one-half of their turnips in
alternate drills, or in alternate doublets, they employ their sheep
in consuming the other half, which they usually do, enclosed in
nets or hurdles, provincially called flakes, constructed for the pur-
pose, and which easily shift from one place to another. Along
