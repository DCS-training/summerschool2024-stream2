that the proportion of this parish, subjected to it, is not much
less than 3000 L. a-year.-Some complaints are also made on
the subject of the late corn law, as tending to diminish the
freedom of trade in this important article, and to render it
more precarious.  The merchant alleges, that, while his ship
is at sea, he is not sure whether the port, to which, from con-
fidence in the law, he ordered his corn, may not, by procla-
mation be shut up: and certainly it has been attended
with some considerable inconveniencies; for, during the last
spring, seed-corn, even from England, though often of the ut-
most importance to this country, and various articles of
household provision, which the country does not yet supply,
were, by its operation, laid under an absolute prohibition, or
a duty which, with equal efficacy, prevented importation.  The
intercourse for corn was not at that time permitted, even with
the county of Fife, from which we are seperated only by the
river; and at the present time, (November the 12th 1792,)
though the harvest has been bad, and the price of grain con-
siderably raised, two vessels with grain and meal, one of which
lies in the harbour, and the other is daily expected, will not
be permitted to unload their cargoes.  Besides these com-
plaints, though the people here are happily free from the
coal duty, to which their more northern neighbours are sub-
jected, it is only from the duty on Scottish coal; and the
present sudden advance in the price of this article, from 4 s.
to upwards of 6 s. for 800 weight, must, while they are not
relieved by importations from England, be severely felt by all
the poor.-With respect to the discontents, which prevail
in Dundee, about the state and mode of the representation of
the people in parliament, and that they are governed by a
magistracy in a great measure independent on them, these are
not peculiar to this place, but common to it with all the towns
in Scotland.
