   Manners, General Character, etc.-The general character
of the people of this parish is sufficiently respectable.  The vir-
tues of humanity, frugality, and industry, the best ornaments
of human nature, flourish among them.  In the war, which
terminated happily in the beginning of his present Majesty's
reign, many became soldiers, and were distinguished for
their valour.  But the military life has no longer the same
charms in their eyes.  In an inland place, such as this, there

hose.  The coat has short skirts.  Great coast are now more
generally used than plaids.  The Sunday vests are com-
monly of striped cotton.  Many of the young men wear
watches.  Many of the young women have printed cotton
gowns, and dussle cloaks.  And several of the farmers and
handicrafstmen have now clocks in their houses.  Many of
the young women are now taught to few and knit stock-

20 years since; and cutaneous disorders have accordingly
ceased to prevail among them.  Although abundantly sen-
sible of the beneficial influence of law, as the guardian of
property, they are now less disposed to litigation, than they
