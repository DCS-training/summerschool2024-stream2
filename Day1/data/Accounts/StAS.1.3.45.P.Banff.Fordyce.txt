     NUMBER IV.

     PARISH OF FORDICE.

     (County of Banff.)

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES LAWTIE.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, and Surface.

   THE antient and modern name of this parish is Fordice,
it is said to be derived from the Gaelic, and to signify
the bleak country.  And, indeed, the upper part of the parish
may still be entitled to the epithet of bleak; but much more
so, before the woods were cut down, and the marshes drain-
ed.  Fordice is situated in Banffshire, in the presbytery of
Fordice, and synod of Aberdeen.

   This parish since Ordiquhill, Deskford, and Cullen, were
detached from it after the Reformation, is nearly triangular-
From the mouth of the river or burn of Boyn, on the east,
to the Knockhill, is five miles Scots.  From the Knockhill
to Logie the same number of miles on the west.  From
Logie to the mouth of the burn of Boyn, near Scots Miln
and Old House of Boyn, alongst the side of the sea, five
miles.  On the east it is bounded by the parish of Boyndie,
on the south by Ordiquhill and Grange, on the west by
Deskford, Rathven, and Cullen, on the north by the sea,
or Moray Frith.
