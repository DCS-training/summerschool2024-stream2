duct of sheep farms in the parish.  They practice the arts
of scouring and bleaching their woollen and linen, which,
for the safety of both yarn and cloth, they prefer to the
methods used in some bleachfields.  A lye made of brec-
kins (pteris aquilina, LINN.) is of great use to them, both
for washing and bleaching.  The method of preparing this
lye is very simple.  The breckins are cut when arrived at
their full growth, and always when dry.  As soon as con-
venient after being cut, they are mixed with dried broom;
both are laid in a heap, and burned.  No more broom is
used than what is necessary to assist in thoroughly burning
them.  Along with the broom is sometimes added the
dried roots of cabbages and green kail.  The ashes of the
whole are carefully collected, and boiled in water until all
the alkali is dissolved; then the lye is poured off for use.
In this lye the yarn or cloth is boiled for a certain time;
and the bleaching is thereby greatly accelerated.  Not a
few of the inhabitants dye a considerable variety of colours,
from materials the product of the country.  In the proper
management of their cloth, however, they are greatly as-
sisted by Mr William Jamison, dyer and clothdresser at
Runroy near Gartness, who has brought the dyeing and
dressing of Scots cloth to a considerable degree of perfec-
tion.  Cloth is sent him to be dyed and dressed from Glas-
gow, Stirling, and all the country round.  Mr Jamison
manufactures plaids, duffles, blankets, etc. etc. for sale;
and his demands are daily increasing.

   In addition to what the industrious women of Killearn
make for their family wear, they bring a considerable
quantity of cloth to the market.  As much usually of
every web is exposed to sale, as defrays the out-laid ex-
pences for weaving, etc.  For this overplus they find
abundance of customers, either in the city of Glasgow, or
