ed Strathgirnie.  There are 2 of the Society's schools in this
parish, and are an unspeakable advantage to the people.  I
am told that 60 or 70 years ago, it was rare to find one in
all these three parishes who could read.  But now all the

engage young men to teach in the winter season in those
places which are at a distance from the established schools.
Three young men, engaged by the people, taught in different
corners this last winter.

parish, and performs divine worship every 2 d Sunday, in a
chapel built for the purpose.-It is believed there is a lead-

been found; but from the expense of working it, no exer-
