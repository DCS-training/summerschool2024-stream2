     Statistical Account

magnificence of the scene is heightened by many rocky pyramids
of immense height, rising, at some distance, out of the sea.
Curious petrefactions, some of them measuring from 2 to 3
feet in length, are found in some of these coves.  On the
estate of Hempriggs in the mouth of a creek, one very re-
markable rock forms a small island, about a gun shot in
length and 24 feet in width, covered with green, and open
at the top, where sea fowls nestle; it is supported by two
oblong pillars, completely intersected, so widely, that a boat
can easily pass through, and so regularly, that it appears
more like the work of art than of nature*.

   Old Wick.-Near this island is the castle of Old Wick,
built upon a narrow promontory:  It is now a ruin, but forms
a good beacon at sea, and is called by sailors the Old Man
of Wick.  It seems to have been constructed for a place of
refuge, having the ruins of a ditch and draw-bridge, a num-
ber of port holes for defence, and a conveyance for retreat-
ing, by a stair descending through the rock, to the sea.  It
was once the residence of the Lords Oliphant (a dormant
title,) one of whom is said, in ancient times, to have been
murdered, at a place not far distant from his castle.

   Salmon Fishing.-On the estate of Hempriggs, is a loch
called the Salmon Craig, where the proprietor has a salmon
fishing, which might be carried on more extensively in the
bay and river of Wick.  The general opinion is, that this fi-
shery would be more productive were the course of the river
altered, and carried in a straight line to the sea, which will be
the case if the projected new harbour takes place.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The rocks along the coast of this parish abound with great
variety of sea-fowl especially marrots, scarts, gulls, wild pi-
geons, etc. affording a great deal of rock-shooting, the produce
of which the fishermen take up in their boats, salt and eat in
winter.
