        which, though connected at its eastern extremity with the for-
	mer, runs afterwards in a parallel direction.  About half a mile
	north of this second ridge, is a third, which is parallel to both, but
	shorter in its extent, and much inferior in its elevation. The only
	other eminence in the parish is about a mile to the north of the
	village of Errol, quite insulated in its position, not much exceed-
	ing a mile in circumference, and, like the last of the three parallel
	ridges, probably not more than 30 or 35 feet above the general
	level of the district.  As to the height of the principal ridge al-
	ready described, the centre of the public street at the cross of the
	village, is, by recent measurement, 116 feet above the low water
	mark of the river, and the platform of the sun-dial to the south of
	the mansion-house of Errol Park is 132 feet above the same level.
	About a mile farther west than this point, and on the estate of
	Murie, the ridge is apparently some feet higher; but even there
	it cannot exceed 140 or 145 feet.
	   The river Tay forms the southern boundary of the parish
	through the whole of its extent.  The bank is very flat, seldom
	more than 20 feet, even above the high-water mark.
	   Meteorology.-The general temperature of the atmosphere in
	this district is milder than usual in the same latitude. This is
	what might naturally be anticipated, from the slight elevation of
	the surface above the level of the sea; from its being sheltered
	on the north by a range of hills, none of which rise so high as to
	be within the region of much cold; and from the absence, gene-
	rally, of those violent currents of wind which are often felt in deep
	contracted valleys.
	   The mean height of the thermometer, as ascertained by daily
	observations, taken at a quarter past nine o'clock A. M., and con-
         tinued for seven years, is 48.497, and the mean height for the
	same period, by observations taken at half-past eight o'clock P. M.,
	is 46.889. The mean daily temperature for the year, taken from
	the average of seven years, is 48.198.  The mean temperature
	for the separate months of the year, taking the same average, will
	be seen from the following tabular view.
