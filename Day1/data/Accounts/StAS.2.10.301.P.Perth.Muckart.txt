within the last twenty years. The chief of these has been the for-
mation of roads, which has opened new channels for intercourse,
and supplied new means and motives for improvement. With
the improvement of the soil, the circumstances and habits of the
people have also improved. They have become upore industrious,
more temperate, more alive to the comforts and conveniences of
life, and more anxious to employ means by which these way be

			PARISH OF MUCKART.

	PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH & STIRLING.

	I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name, Boundary, &c.-THE name of the parish has been writ-
ten in various ways. The most ancient way appears to have been
Mucard, the more recent Muckhart, and the modern Muckart.
It is obviously derived from the Gaelic words " Muc," a wild
boar, and " gart," the head, or " ard," high; alluding, as some
suppose, to the shape of the hill terminating above the Yetts
of Muckart, whicb, from one point of view in the parish, is suppos-
ed to bear some resemblance to a boar's head; or, according to
others, to its being in ancient times infested by the wild boar. The
shape of the parish is triangular. Its greatest length in a straight
line, from east to west, is about 4 1/2 miles, and its greatest breadth,
from north to south, about 2 miles: altogether it may contain about
6 square miles. The Devon forms its principal boundary, sepa-
rating it, with the exception of one farm, from the parish of Fosso-
way, on the south and east. On the north and west, it is separated
respectively, by two small streams, from the parishes of Glendovan
and Dollar.                                                             i         .
   Topographical Appearances.-A branch of the Ochils, running
east and west, lies along the northern boundary of the parish, and
is terminated on the east by a conical shaped hill, called Sea Mab,
