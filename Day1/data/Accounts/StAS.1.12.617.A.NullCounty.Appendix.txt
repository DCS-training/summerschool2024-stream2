<FOOTNOTE>

*No regular register either of marriages, or deaths, has been kept.  But
in 1784, 109 deaths are recorded. In some subsequent years, only 48, 56, etc.
are recorded. Nor can the register of baptisms be depended on; for, since the
duty on registration was laid on, many, rather than pay it, neglect to register.
