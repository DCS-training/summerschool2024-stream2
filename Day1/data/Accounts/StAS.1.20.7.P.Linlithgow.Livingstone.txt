way to demonstration, and these practices became as uni-
versally copied as they had formerly been ridiculed.
   As the improved practice of husbandry, however, is now
so generally known over Scotland, it would be unnecessary
here to enter into particulars; there is only one other which
we shall beg leave to mention, because it is of the utmost
importance, and seems to be little attended to by farmers:
This is the mode of increasing the quantity of manure upon
a farm, as parcticed by the person alluded to, simply, by
making the stable yard or site of the dunghill much deeper
than ordinary, preventing, as much as possible, any drain
from it, and beginning the dunghill every year by laying in
3 or 4 feet deep of the best earth which can be procured
upon the farm, from the banks of rivulets, or other places,
where it is either totally useless, or lies thicker than neces-
sary; then spreading the dung regularly, as it is made, over
this earth, and at the same time allowing the drains from
the kitchen, stables, byres, and seeding shades, to run into
it.  Having lain through the season in this situation, the
earth at the boottom, from having absorbed all these juices,
will be found very little inferior in quality to the dung
above it.
   In addition to this, it is well worth the farmer's while,
where he has the command of lime, and such earth as has
been mentioned, to employ his people as much as possible
in making composts of these materials, for a top dressing to
his grass lands.
   It is unnecessary to inculcate the utility of draining wet
lands; besides the ordinary kind of drains, some others have
been used here, which, we believe, are not generally known
in this country.
   The annexed plate exhibits transverse sections of 3 drains,
which may be understood without much further explana-
tion.
