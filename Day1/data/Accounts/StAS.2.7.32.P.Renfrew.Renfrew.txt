     Prison.-The number of prisoners confined here, and connect
ed with this district, does not amount to half a dozen in a year
and they are nearly all debtors. A few others come here fro
other places. The apartments are well aired, and bv no means
unheakby; and, with regard to religious instruction, the period
of incarceration is usually too short, to make this any matter of
anxiety.
Fairs, Public ,ffouses, 8fc.-There are three fairs held in the
burgh annually, chiefly for the sale of cattle; and an attempt has
lately been made, to get up a cattle show, which is likely to suc-
ceed. The number of public houses in the parish has been for
several years about 30. They are, especially in this place, pro-
ductive of evil, from the immense number who frequent them
on, the Lords day, chiefly from , Glasgow and Paisley, partieu-
larly the latter. Some of those who sell spirits `re, with ore-
dit; io themselves, particularly attentive in preventing abuse;
a few of them shutting their houses entirely on Sabbath. And
the present magistrates -have very laudably enforced the obser-
van(,e of the licensing act, on Saturday night and during di.,i.
vine, service on the Lord,s day. But. still, abuses conifected with
public houses, and especially on the Lord's day, are among the
chief hinderances to the moral and religious improvement of the
parish. And there can'be no reasonable doubt, that the use of
axdent spirits over the country is at present one of the greatest
prevailing, evils, economically, morally, and religiously. It is dif-
fizult to say ,by -what, single , means the evil may be remedied.
But if the nation at large were only in earnest, perhaps few of
the means which have been proposed would either remain untried,
or 'Prove uminfluential.
