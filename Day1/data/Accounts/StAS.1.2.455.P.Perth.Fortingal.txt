begging poor have a share of every thing the tenants can af-
ford; meal, wool, milk, etc.  They go about, twice or thrice
a year, lay by a little, then apply to spinning, or some little
industry, to procure themselves some of the necessaries,
or conveniencies of life.  It would be deemed impious
to refuse an alms, or a night's quarters to a poor person.-
There are a great many beggars from other places.  The on-
ly grievance, in this respect, is from swarms of tinkers, sai-
lors, and vagrants, from the great towns, who, by dreadful
imprecations and threatenings, extort charity, and immedi-
ately waste it in drunkenness and riot.  These are often guil-
ty of theft, sometimes of robbery.

   Prices, Wages, etc.-Butcher meat is fully as high priced
as in the great towns.  Cheese, 6 s. butter, 12 s. the stone; a
hen, 6 d. 12 eggs, 3 d.  A servant man's wages are from L. 5 
to 6 d.  A maid's, from L. 2:10, to L. 3. taylors, shoe-
makers, and day labourers, get 6 d, carpenters 8 d, and ma-
sons 14 d, besides maintenance.

   The general run of farms is, from 4 to 6 acres laboured
land.  Some few have 12 acres; still fewer have double that
quantity.  The rent is principally paid for the grass.  The
whole tenants of the parish are restricted to a certain number
of cattle, which they must not exceed.  A crosser pays for an
acre of ground, and the privilege of keeping a cow and 6
sheep, L. 1:13:4; for 2, double that sum.  A tenant, for his
5 or 6 acres, 2 horses, 10 cows, and their followers, 100 sheep
and their lambs, pays L. 20, and a little more sometimes.  Few
of the tenants have a man servant.  A village or two, join a-
bout a shepherd.  The sheep are never housed, the storms ne-
ver being heavy, owing to the westerly situation.
   We have no ale-houses, but ten whisky houses.  The con-
sumption of this spirit is not half what it was.
