lowing, etc.  They are all the common Scoth plough, ex-
cepting 2 or 3 belonging to Lord Hopetoun, with pot-me-
tal glebe boards.  These can never be common here, as our
land is stony and uneven.  In general, the farmers have 2
carts each.  At Raehills (so called from its having been
long ago kept as a deer park by the family of Annandale)
there are a few deer, between 20 and 30, lately placed there
by the Earl of Hopetoun.  About as many goats are to be
seen in an adjoining pasture.  A great part of the parish
has been inclosed since the present Earl came to the ma-

church was built in 1733, the manse in 1735, and has much

the east, and the other towards the west end of the parish.
The masters in both are very well qualified to teach the
branches of education they prosses, viz. writing, reading, a-
rithmetic and book-keeping.  The scholars in each are about
30 in winter, and 20 in summer.  Their salaries are different,
the one having 200 merks, the other 150.  Their fees for
reading, 1 s. a quarter, (and although they write, pay no
more arithmetic 1 s. 6 d. for a course of book-keeping
