King's favour, that, upon his return home, he, with the con-
currenee and approbation of his Sovereign, applied the whole
rents of his bishoprick, which, during his absence in Eng-
land, had accumulated to a considerable sum, towards build-
ing the bridge over Don, of one large Gothic arch, where it
now stands, upon the great high road leading northward
from Aberdeen; and it appears to have been built about the
year 1320.  Bishop Cheyne died in 1329.

   Bridge of Dee.-Bishop William Elphinston left a consi-
derable legacy to build a bridge over the river Dee, near
Aberdeen, as well as for the erection of an University at Old
Aberdeen, where the Bishop's Cathedral stood, but died in
1514, before any thing was done in the building of the
bridge.  Gavin Dunbar, son to Sir James Dunbar of Cum-
nock, by Elisabeth daughter of the Earl of Sutherland, and
uncle to Gavin Dunbar, Archbishop of Glasgow, having
succeeded to the bishoprick of Aberdeen in 1518, he soon
thereafter caused collect and receive the money which had
been left by Bishop Elphinston for the building of this
bridge; and having also contributed himself a considerable
sum of money to that work, he caused erect the greatest part
of the bridge where it now stands, of seven arches, about the
year 1530, although it was not finished till after his death.
This bridge having gone into decay about the year 1720,
it was rebuilt out of the funds belonging to itself by the Ma-
gistrates and Town-Council of Aberdeen from 1720 to 1724,
and is at this day one of the neatest and best set down bridges
to the river of any in Scotland.
