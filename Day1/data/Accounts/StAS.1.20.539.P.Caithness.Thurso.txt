     of Thurso.

   The road, at present, from Skinnet to Thurso is not very
good, but it might be completed at a small expence.

   Peats or turf, for fuel, are scarce, but of water there is
abundance, and coals may be transported by sea to Thurso.

   The value of the mine might be tried at a small expence,
as it lies on the side of a hill, gently sloping about half-a
mile higher than the river Thurso; but with such a descent
to the river, that no engine would be necessary for clearing
off the water.

   Were this mine not to answer, there are many otehr ap-
pearances on the estate of Sir John Sinclair, and on the pro-
perty of other gentlemen in the neighbourhood, which
might be well worthy the attention of the Company.

   After some correspondence upon the subject, the plan
was dropped, the Company refusing to send their agent to
view the premises, unless the proprietor was to be at the
whole expence of the survey.  There are certainly, how-
ever, some valuable mines in that neighbourhood, either in
the parish of Thurso, or that of Halkirk, which, it is to be
hoped, will some time or other, be worked to advantage.

   SECT. III. Quarries.-In every part of the parish there
are quarries of whin-stone, and in some places of grey state,
which are frequently used in covering the roofs of houses.
In the shores of Scrabster and Pennyland, there is, as for-
merly observed, a good free-stone quarry below stood-mark,
but accessible and easily wrought at low-water.

   SECT. IV. Natural Curiosities.-The rocks which bound
the coast from Holburnhead to Brims Castle, exhibit various
scenes of natural grandeur.  The Clett is an insulated rock
of great height, separated from the land by a deep channel,
not above 80 yards across at the broadest part.  The rock
itself is perpendicular on all sides, and may be about 160
