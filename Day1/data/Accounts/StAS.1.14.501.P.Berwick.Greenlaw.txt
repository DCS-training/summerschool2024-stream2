     NUMBER XXX.

     PARISH OF GREENLAW.

     (COUNTY OF BERWICK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIMOT-
     DALE, PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE.)

     By the Rev. Mr. WILLIAM SIMSON.

     Extent, Name, Soil, Surface, etc.

   THE parish of Greenlaw is between 7 and 8 miles in
length, from N. to S.; and, on an average, about
2 miles in breadth.  In this parish, there are several of
those round hills, or detached eminences, which, from
their conical figure, are well known in Scotland by the
name of Laws.  It is from one of these, which, in the
original uncultivated state of the country, being greener
than the rest, that the parish evidently derives its name.-
The soil is extremely various.  In the S. part of the pa-
rish, it consists of a deep, strong clay, and produces ex-
cellent wheat, barley, oats, hay, and fine pasture.  In pro-
ceeding northward, it becomes worse.  In many places,
it is wet and spongy; and both the grain and grass are of
an inferior quality; but such parts as are dry, bear good
oats, excellent turnips, and heavy crops of clover and rye
