number was 555. of whon 268 were males, 287 were fe-
males, 65 were under six years of age, 99 were under 10 years,
50 were Nonjurors, and 2 were Bereans.  But in 1790,
the number was only 505, of which 256 were males, 249
were females, 62 were under six, and 98 under ten.  There 
are at present six tailors, seven weavers, two smiths, and
two wrights, within the parishes.  In 1790, the number of
Nonjurors, or more properly now, Episcopalians, was 56.  The
cause of the diminution of the number of people is, that in
no less than six cases, two farms have, within these four-
teen years, been joined into one.  Besides the number of
subtenants is also considerably diminished.  There were six-
teen houses, then inhabited by subtenants, which are now
ruinous.  In some cases, the possessors, being old people,
died out; and others, the farmers chose to have their
possession of land in their own hand, because they could
turn it to more advantage; besides they wished to lessen
the number of their subtenants, because they found it in-
convenient to lead fuel to them, and to perform other sti-
pulated services.  The diminishing of the number of sub-
tenants and the uniting of farms, it is presumed, is an evil
not peculiar to this corner.  The consequence is, that there
is, and has been for some time, a great diffuculty in procu-
ring servants.
