years, which is astonishing to the older inhabitants; and has
been followed by a proportional alteration in the manners,
customs, and stile of living of the inhabitants.  And
as many of the merchants have of late years been en-
gaging in manufactures and trade, the distance in point of
rank and consequence, between merchants and tradesmen,
has now become less conspicuous, than it was before the
American war.
   The strict severity and apparent sanctity of manners, for-
merly remarkable here, have yielded to the opposite extreme.
There is now a great deal more industry on six days of the
week, and a great deal more dissipation and licentionsness
on the seventh.  Great crimes were formerly very uncom-
mon; but now robberies, housebreaking, swindling, pick-
pockets, pilferers, and consequently executions are become
more common.  These delinquents, as well as common
prostitutes, are often little advanced above childhood; and
yet a healthy child of 7 or 8 years, or at most of 10 years
of age, can now earn a very decent subsistence from some of
the numerous manufactures established among us.

   In an account of a city like Glasgow, a description of A-
NIMALS is not expected; it may not be improper, however,
to give a list of the differnt kinds of FISH, which are
found in the river and srith of Clyde, though it is not gi-
ven as complete, as many other kinds may still be found.
