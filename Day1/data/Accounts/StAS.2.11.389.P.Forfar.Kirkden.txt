ties wherein they excel. The four or five shift rotation is employ-
ed, and every species of crop is raised to good advantage. The
estate of Idvies has, within the last forty years, been entirely re-
claimed, from a bleak moor, to a warm and fertile condition, by
judicious draining and planting, &c. Leases commonly extend
to nineteen years. The farm-buildings are in general very good,
and the fences, which are of stone, are not bad; but the paucity of
hedges, notwithstanding trees are seldom absent, greatly impedes
that luxuriance and warmth which the country would otherwise
assume. The farmers, however, prefer the stone dikes, not only
because they are more cheaply and expeditiously brought to per-
fection, on account of their easy access to material; but because
hedges harbour birds, which destroy the crops.

	Manufactures.--This parish contains about 789 manufacturing
operatives, employed in spinning flax and weaving Osnaburgh cloth,
two-thirds of whom are females, and of these nearly four-fifths are
weavers on the handloom. This resource makes female farm-
servants very independent in their own eyes, because the equally
lucrative employment of the loom or mill is at their acceptance.

			V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	Market-Towns &c.--Arbroath and Forfar, the nearest market-
places, are respectively five miles distant from the eastern and
western extremities of tbe parish.
	The nearest Post-Offices are those of Forfar and Arbroath.
Application was made to Government a few years ago, to establish
a letter-carrier between Forfar and Arbroath via Letham, but the
sollitation was rejected; although in all likelihood, no loss would
have been sustained thereby; as a person has, for a number of
years, made a very good livelihood by undertaking on his own
account the post between Forfar and Letham.
