clay.  Being so near the sea-coast, it is natural to imagine
the air is pure, and upon the whole healthy; though I
have often thought the water which comes from the higher
grounds, and stagnates in the village, occasions nervous se-
vers, especially among young people, and makes epidemi-
cal distempers to rage severely among us.  This easily might
be prevented, as there is a beautiful and gradual descent
from the summit of the higher grounds to the sea-shore,
and conduits for the water, at little expence, could be
made.  The only spring worthy of notice, is a steel mine-
ral, which, about 30 or 40 years ago, was resorted to by
many distressed with various complaints.  Its taste and
strenght are the same with the Peterhead water, so justly
samed, but the spring much greater; so that, at one period,
what flowed from it, afforded a sufficient quantity of water
for driving a meal-mill.

numbers were 871. From the last state of the rolls, the
numbers amounted to 807, of whom 467 reside in the vil-
lage, and the remaining 340 inhabit the country part of
the parish.  For 30 years back, the annual averages have
been 16 deaths, 22 baptisms, and 6 marriages.  There are
about 24 extensive farmers, whole families amount to 192
souls.  There are only 11 Seceders.

year.  Maid servants wages are from L. 2 to L. 2, 10 s or
