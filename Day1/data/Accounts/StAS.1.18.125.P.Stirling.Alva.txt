     NUMBER IV.

     PARISH OF ALVA.

     (COUNTY OF STIRLING.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN DUNCAN.

     Name.

   IN the writings of the last century, and before that time,
the name of this parish was generally written Alvath, or
Alveth; but that mode of spelling has been disused almost a
complete century.  Whether the present name, Alva, be of
Gaelic origin, is not altogether certain.  Fanciful etymologies
can never yield satisfaction to the judicious antiquary; and
therefore when nothing rational can be offered, it seems bet-
ter to acknowledge ignorance, than to offer what can neither
amuse nor inform.

   Situation.-This parish and barony is a part of the county
of Stirling, although it happens to be totally disjoined from
every part of it.  No certain account can now be given, how
this has happened.  It is surrounded by the shire of Clack-
mannan on the east, south, and west, and on the north, it is
bounded by a part of the county of Perth.  It extends in
length, from east to west, somewhat more than two miles
