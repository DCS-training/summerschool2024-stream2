   Rental.--The rental of the whole parish when valued in Crom-
well's time, was L. 1206 Scots, equal to L. 100, 10s. Sterling; and
Wodrow, the Church Historian, speaks of it as the same at the
time he wrote, about 1722. So late as 1770, the best land in the
parish was let on an average at 2s. 6d. per acre. About 1780,
much of the best land in the parish was let on lease for nineteen
years, at 10s. per acre; and when the leases expired, what had
been let at 10s. rose to L.2 per acre. For some years about
1812, several parks about Stevenston, which in 1770 had brought
only 2s. 6d. per acre, were let on lease for common agricultural
purposes, at L. 10 and L. 11 per acre. Though not much more
than the half of the parish has been improved, no parish in the
whole district of Cuninghame has increased nearly so much in
value as Stevenston, since the whole of them were valued by Go-
vernment in 1652 and 1653. By a table in Robertson's "De-
scription of Cuninghame," it appears from the returns in 1809,
that on an average of all the parishes of the district, the rental
was eighteen times more in 1809 than in 1653. The greatest
rise, however, had taken place in Stevenston, where the rental was
forty-five times larger, having risen from L. 100, 19s. to L. 4536,
17s. 8d. How much more has the parish risen in value, if we
take into account the great additional revenue arising from the
coal mines, the stone and lime quarries, the railroad, the harbour,
some of which were not in existence at that early period, and others
yielded almost nothing.
   Eminent Men.--Among the distinguished persons connected
with this parish we may surely rank Robert Cuninghame, Esq.
the nephew of Sir Robert Cuninghame, who, at a time when min-
ing was little understood in this country, showed such science and
enterprise, and furnished, though at a high price, such, a store of
important information for his successors.
   The most remarkable person, however, connected with this pa-
rish, was the late General Alexander Hamilton, of the family of
Grange, though America was the field in which he distinguished
himself. He was excelled by none as a general, orator, financier,
statesman, and lawyer. In the words of one who knew him, he

in Kilmarnock. She also told us, that the stipend meal, to which, on the death of
her husband, she was entitled, in 1758, sold at 6d. per peck; that a leg of beef, at
Martinmas, might then be purchased for 5s.; that salmon sold at 1d. a pound, of
24 oz.; butter at 4d. per pound, of 24 oz.; and eggs at 1d. the dozen; that a tailor
received 4d. per day and his meals; that a maid-servant's half-year fee was 13s. 4d.
and a new apron; and that coals were then shipped for Ireland at 4s. 7d. per ton of
24 cwts.
