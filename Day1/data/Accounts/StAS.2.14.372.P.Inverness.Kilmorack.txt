 372             INVERNESS-SHIRE.

August; 6th, third Tuesday of September ; 7th, third Tues-
day of October; 8th, second Wednesday of November. There
are also four fairs, annually held in the village of Beauly, during
the months of May, August, October, and November. The Oc-
tober and November markets are for the sale of country produce,
that of August for engaging shearers. Little business is done at
any of them.
   Inns.-There is one principal inn in the parish, which is kept
in the most orderly manner; but there are also nine public-houses,
the effect of which upon the morals of the people is pernicious.
   Fuel.-Peat is one principal fuel, which costs per cart load
from ls. to ls. 6d. A great quantity of coals and wood is also con-
sumed.
            MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
Since the former Statistical  Account was published, a better
system of husbandry has been introduced-extensive lots of waste
land have been reclaimed-the facilities of internal communication
have been, and are increasing-farm-houses and steadings exhibit
a more cheerful and commodious aspect-and there is more hap-
piness and comfort in the abodes of the people. Still, however,
there seems wanting among the tenantry, that sociality and mu-
tual,co-operation which can alone ensure success in any undertak-
ing: for there is a deep-rooted antipathy in the bosom of High-
landers to all those strangers from the south, who now occupy so
many of the townships in the Highlands. The establishment of a
district Agricultural Society would greatly tend to diminish this
hostility, and diffuse a good feeling and unanimity amongst its
members, which would be productive of immense advantage to the
Country.
