abundant, and generally forms a bed of 40 feet in thickness, im-
mediately beneath the surface. In the years 1824 and 1825, an
attempt was made, by boring, at Myreside quarry, on the estate
of Blackadder, to determine whether there existed a coal seam of
sufficient quality and magnitude to warrant an expenditure of ca-
pital. The result was deemed unfavourable. The information
obtained from the person who conducted the experiment on that
occasion, enables us to compile the following tabular statement.
We retain the local names.

   The alluvial soil, to a considerable depth, is replete with vege-
table remains, such as oak copsewood, hazel nuts, and the various
plants indigenous to the country. On penetrating farther, a species
of marl, composed chiefly of shells and plants, is thrown up,-thus
demonstrating that the whole track was at an early period under
water.
   Fir on the inferior soils, and the different kinds of hard wood
on the richer, are grown, principally on the estates of Wynnefield,
Blackadder, and Laws. They are all in a thriving condition, and,
while forming an agreeable ornament to the landscape, will amply
remunerate the proprietors.*
