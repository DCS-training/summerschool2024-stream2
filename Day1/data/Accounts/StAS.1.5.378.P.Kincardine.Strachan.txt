in the hills.  They are, for the most part, of a small size. 
Sheep, brought from the south of Scotland, commonly turn 
out well, and there are a great many of there is the glen of 
Dye.  It is a general practice, among the farmers, to put 
their sheep into houses during the night, which is hurtful 
to the sheep, and likewise to the wool. 

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is no marl as yet
found out, in this part of the country, but limestone is to 
be had in the neighbourhood in great plenty.  It is most 
commonly burned with peats and turf, from the hills, 
which is the fuel generally made use of, and with which 
the country is well supplied.-There are two waters, which 
run through this parish, the Feugb and the Dye, which take 
their rise in the Grampian mountains, unite about a quar-
ter of a mile above the church, and fall into the Dee 2 
miles below.  On both these streams there is, in the season, 
excellent rod-fishing for grilfe, sea and burn trout.  On the 
hills, which are mostly covered with heath, with grass
grounds intersppersed, moor game abound. Hares, partridges, 
and wild ducks, are likewise to be found in the more cul-
tivated part of the parish.  There are a good many deer 
in the woods.-A man servant, who is reckoned a good 
hand, will draw yearly upwards of L. 5 Sterling of wages. 
A woman servant about half that sum.  A day-labourer will 
earn about 10 d. a-day.  The women's chief employment 
is knitting worsted stockings, and spinning factory yarn.
The manufacturers send out the wool, properly dressed, 
and afterwards come and receive the stockings, when 
manufactured, for which they pay according to the quality. 
They have agents in the country who give out the flax 
and receive the yarn.
