tacked near Dunrobin Castle, when the men and officers
were separated, at crossing a ferry near that place, most of
the latter were obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of
war.

   SECT. IV. Public Buildings.-The church is the only
public building in the town.  It is built in the Gothic style,
in the form of a cross, and though not large, it is a substantial
and commodious building.  In the south aisle, is the burying-
place of the family of Sinclair of Murkle.  The north aisle
belongs to the town exclusively.  The rest is possessed by
the country heritors and their tenants, but very unequally
indeed, and a division of the church is very much wanted.

   SECT. V. Private Houses.-The number of private in-
habited houses in Thurso, is from 320 to 350; and of these,
above 20 houses have been built within the last 5 years, some
of them rather in a style of elegance for a country town.  But
it is to be regretted, that though the town appears to have
been originally designed on a regular plan, yet it was early
departed from, and the houss, for the most part, are placed
in the most confused manner.  Sir John Sinclair, however,
now proposes to feu off a tract of ground on the south side
of the town, which will give ample scope to the inhabitants
to extend the town, and must prove an ornament to the
place, as the feuars, in the new town, are to be restricted to
build according to a fixed plan.  The proposed situation is re-
markably pleasant, extending along the banks of the river,
which at stream-tides is navigable for vessels of 50 or 60
tons burdens, the full length of the ground appropriated for
building.  Of course, the new town will possess every ad-
vantage for trade which the old town enjoys, while, at the
same time, it will be less exposed to encroachment from the
sea.
