upon a strong brick clay bottom, exceedingly cold, and al-
most impenetrable by water.  Where this is the case, the
soil is wettish, requires a stronger culture, and is always
later, and more dependent upon the seasons.  The crops
least liable to disappoint the expectations of the husband-
man upon this soil, are oats and grass.  A second kind of
soil, consisting of a whitish clay, from 12 to 20 inches
deep, in some parts rich and loamy, and sometimes mixed
with a little moss, forms a great part of the parish.  This
soil being almost constantly upon the clayey bottom, is
wettish and uncertain.  When, however, excited by lime
and other stimulating manures, it generally produces oats
and grass in abundance.  Most of the lands lately broken
up, and those still remaining in a natural state, will, in the
course of improvement, become of this complexion.  The
present surface, which, to the deepness of 10 or 12 inches,
inclines to moss, and which seems to have been formed,
from the putrefaction of coarse vegetables, which have
from time to time sprung on its surface, experience
proves, will disappear in the course of 15 years; or even
in a period much shorter than this, by repeatedly fallow-
ing.  The value of moor for pasture may, at an average,
be called 3 s. a acre; that of arable land, from 5 s. to L. 1,
10 s.

   Agriculture.-The wretched mode of cultivation, which
formerly prevailed all over this country, begins now gra-
dually to disappear, and a more extensive and liberal system
of agriculture has been adopted.  The intelligent farmer is
now fully convinced, that a well chosen rotation of crops, and
regular cessation from tillage, by laying his fields out un-
der grass, are of the utmost importance in husbandry.
With a view to render this more general, the chief he-
ritors in this parish have prescribed in lease a particular
