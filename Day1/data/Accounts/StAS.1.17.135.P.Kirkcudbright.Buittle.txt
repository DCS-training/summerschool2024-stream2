more affected the public mind.  That spirit of unity and in-
divisibility, that is, of arrogance and depredation, which has
so fatally attracted the rabble of Paris, may prevail in
Edinburgh or Glasgow:-Should that be the case the
peaceable and unarmed inhabitants of the country know
what awaits them.  On this principle, it is believed, more
national guards might be enlisted in this quarter in one day,
than all the declamations against regal tyranny, or parlia-
mentary corruption, could assemble in a twelvemonth.  The
lowering the freehold qualification, and the abrogating or li-
miting the law of patronage, have been the ultimatum of
proposed reformation in this country.

   Disadvantages.-If these and the like are speculative and
imaginary grievances, we have but few real ones to complain
of.  Instances, however, of this kind might be given.  That
PENTE of the waters, (as modern naturalists say), which is
manifested by the retreat of the sea on every western coast, is
abundantly remarkable on the shores of the Solway Frith.
Many acres there, which were barren sand 30 years ago, are
new good pasture land; and in the middle of this arm of
the sea, banks or mountains are daily increasing in size, so
that they will soon be islands, and will soon be arable.  The
consequent shallowness of the Frith, and of the river Urr,
renders it therefore impossible, that the navigation of the Urr
can be carried on by vessels much above 50 tons burden;
and these can only find access at the usual landing places,
(and the most useful), at spring tides.  Now, as the law
stands, the fees, etc. of the custom-house, are as high for a
vessel of 50 tons as for one of 500, and as high for a boat
of 5 tons, as for a sloop of 50.  In a few years, however, the
trade of this river must be carried on, perhaps, by vessels as
small or smaller than any we have mentioned; and the pro-
