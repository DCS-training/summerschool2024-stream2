     Prices of Labuor, and Implements of Husbandry.--The rate of
ploughmen's wages per annum varies from L. 9 to L. 10, 10s.
When married, and not living in the farm-house, they have as
an allowance for bed and board, a dwelling-house, prnvision for
a cow throughout the year, 52 stones (old weight) of oatmeal,
one-half boll of seed-potatoes planted, and four cart loads of coals,
about 64 cwt. driven,--they paying, the coals at the pit, and the
tolls on the road. The wages of women-servants connected with
the farms may be stated at L.4 in summer, and at L.2 in win-
ter.
    Enclosing and draining are now generally set by the piece; 7s.
per rood, of six yards, being considered a fair price for finishing
dry stone dikes ; and 8d. per rood for cutting drains three feet
deep, the farmer in general filling them up with stones, and cover-
ing them in by his own servants.
    The average rate of mason and carpenters' wages is probably
about 15s. per week in summer, and perhaps 12s. in winter.
    An excellent wooden plough, full mounted, may be made in the
parish for L.2, 1Os., and a pair of harrows for L.1, 8s.  A close-
bodied single-horse cart may cost L.9 ; and other articles in pro-
portion to the work employed on them. Excellent sheep-flakes
of larch may be had for 2s. each.
