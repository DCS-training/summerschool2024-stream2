different kinds of sheep, which makes the want of sences
the less felt.  Some stone walls have been put up between
different proprietors, which have proved advantageous and 
satisfactory in so far as they have stood.  But the stone is
generally of a bad quality.  By a few years exposure to
the air, it moulders and falls.  The use of keeping sheep,
and disadvantages before mentioned of the want of leases,
etc. has hitherto prevented enclosing by thorn hedges,
though there are some thousands of acres in the lower part
of the parish well adapted for it.  Hedges tried there thrive
uncommonly.  The hedges of one field enclosed at Wyn-
holmhall, would turn a bull in less than 10 years after the
thorns were planted.

   Crops.-The crops raised are chiefly oats, some barley,
potatoes, a few turnip, and flax in small quantities.  Clover
and rye grass grow well where sown.  Wheat has not sil-
led to perfection, where tried; but none has been attempt-
ed in the most likely places.  It seems once to have been
the growth of Corrie.  Two farms are named Wheatrigs,
or Whitrigs.

   Proprietors, and Number of Farms.-The whole of Hut-
ton and Corrie belong in superiority to the Earl of Hope-
toun, as heir of the Annandale family, and nearly four-
fifths of them are his property.  There are 6 other heri-
tors.  The rental of the whole is about L. 3000.  The
number of sheeps is nearly 12,000.  Cattle, 1200; horses,
140.  There are 2 farms, each of L. 220; 4 from L. 140
to L. 180; 7 from L. 80 to L. 120; 7 from L. 50 to L. 80,
14 from L. 30 to L. 50; and 7 under L. 30.

   Inhabitants.-The numer of inhabitants of these pa-
rishes in 1755 was 993.  In 1793, they are of all ages,
