thence extends to the head of Lochial.  On the south side
lies Strathharrie, part of Abertarf, Letterfinlay) Keppoch and
Glen-navas.  All these extensive countries, abound with ex-
cellent woods, (consisting chiefly of oak, ash, elm, birch and
fir;) which at present, however, are of no great value to the
proprietors, nor of any real advantage to the public, for want
of water carriage to bring them to market.  In all parts of
these countries, bordening on the sides of the supposed canal,
there are rivers, and copious streams of water, for working all
kinds, of machinery: and, notwithstanding the emigrations
that have taken place from some of the districts, there are
still many inhabitants, who, by habits of industry, might be-
come a valuable acquisition to the manufacturing and sea-
saring part of society.  The lakes and rivers are well stored
with salmon and trout; the low grounds, for the most part,
capable of being rendered very fertile; and the hills not Fur-
passed by any in Scotland for sheep ranges.  In short, this
valley between Inverness and Fortwilliam, were the canal
opened, and manufactures established on both sides of it,
would soon become the centre of trade in the Highlands
where the mechanic, the merchant, and the manufacturer,
would find sufficient employment, and the industrious labour-
er meet with due encouragement.
   II.  With regard to the commercial interest of England
and Ireland, a canal here, on such a scale as to admit vessels
drawing about 16 feet water, would be attended with most
solid and permanent advantages.  All ships from Ireland and
the west coast of Britain, bound for the east coast for Hol-
land, or the Baltic, could perform their voyage in, at least,
a third less time than now, and with greater safety.  In like
manner, all the West India and American traders, from the
east of Scotland and north-east coast of England, could avoid
the circuitous and dangerous navigation of the Pentland
