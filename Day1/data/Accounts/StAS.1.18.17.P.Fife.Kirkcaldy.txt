the fishing trade among the Western islands, the colony was
drawn from the coasts of Fife+.  The towns on the Frith of
Forth too had almost the exclusive possession of the trade
with the Low Countries, at that time the only branch of
commerce of any importance, and were carriers for nearly
the whole of the northern part of the United Kingdom.
