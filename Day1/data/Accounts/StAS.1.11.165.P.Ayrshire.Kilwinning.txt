acknowledged, that few, if any, real improvements in agri-
culture can be made, and that trade and manufactures cannot
be extended to any great and permanent degrees without cheap
fuel.  Influenced, then, by a sense of their own interest, let
proprietors immediately work their own coals, and, at the
same time, lower the price of them.  This will induce farmers,
manufacturers and tradesmen, to leave those places in which
firing is scarce and dear, and settle in this parish.

   Poor.-There are at present on the poor's roll 36 persons,
who receive from 2 s. to 5 s. per month.  Besides these, 2
young men, fatuous, are maintained at the rate of 8 s. 8 d.
a month, each.  The annual amount of these pensions is 55 L.
Distribution is also made, occasionally, to other poor sick
persons, not on the pension list; and even to those pensioners,
whose circumstances require additional supply, to the average
sum, yearly, of 28 L.  The following is a state of the funds.
