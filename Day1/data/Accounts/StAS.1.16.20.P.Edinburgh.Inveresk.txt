that one, who was delivered on Wednesday morning, went

There is a charm in the free and active life they lead, which
renders them averse to all sedentary employments.  They
never wear shoes or stockings but on Sundays, which is not
to be attributed to their poverty, but to the nature of their
employment.  Strangers from the south, disgusted at this
practice, which more or less prevails among the women of
the inferior class in this country, and still more with the
custom of trampling linens in washing tubs, (which is not
yet entirely discontinued, though gradually wearing out),
cry out against both as shocking pieces of barbarity.  It
may be remarked, however, in regard to the former prac-
tice, that the Greek and Roman women, (even the ladies
in the house), wore neither shoes nor stockings.

MONBODDO, and the LYCURGUSES of the age, will no doubt
look forward with anxiety to the period, when the work
that is now done by women, shall come to be entirely per-
formed by horses and carts.  For their consolation, how-
ever, it may be observed, that we perceive at present no
difference between the children of Musselburgh and those
of Fisherrow, where the fishers live.  Where the labouring
poor have enough to feed their children with, there is
little doubt, that the race will always prove both strong
and numerous.

1755, which is chiefly owing to the present thriving state
