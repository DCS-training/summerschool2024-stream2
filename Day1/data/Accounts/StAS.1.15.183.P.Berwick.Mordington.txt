which now so generally prevails in this and many other
parts of Scotland.  It would indeed be unlucky, if a mode
of farming, which must be allowed greatly to increase the
most useful and most necessary commodities of a country,
should have a tendency to diminish the number of its inha-
bitants.  For there cannot be a doubt, that by the present
system of husbandry, which prevails in this part of the coun-
try, the grounds produce a much greater quantity of every
species of grain, and afford sustenance to double the number
of cattle, sheep, and stock of every kind, than they did be-
fore this mode was adopted.  Its being carried on by fewer
hands, in consequence of the abridgement of labour, and
greater proportion of the lands being thrown into grass,
though it must no doubt diminish the number of the people
employed in the purposes of agriculture, and in many
riches, where that forms the role employment of the inhabi-
tants, render such parishes less populous; yet it does not
follow, as a just inference from thence, that the number of
inhabitants in the country at large is thereby diminished.  It
has only the effect of making the superfluous hands betake
themselves to other occupations, and thus become the means
of increasing the number of our manufacturers, and furnish-
ing labourers for other useful and important purposes; such
as making and repairing the public roads, inclosing and drain-
ing the fields, etc.  And there cannot be a doubt, that even
in this county, where the monopoly of farms is perhaps car-
ried to a greater length, than in any other county in Scotland,
it will be found, when the extent of its whole population is as-
certained, that the number of its inhabitants is rather increas-
ed than diminished:  And that the diminution in many of the
parochial districts, from the causes above mentioned, is more
than counter-balanced by the additional increase in the towns
and villages.  This reasoning will appear the more conclu-
