not be reclaimed without immense expence.
   Farming utensils were extremely rude.  Peat from the moss,
and dung to the field were carried in panniers.  Tumbling
carts (the axle revolving with a clumsy wheel) composed of
the roughest materials were next introduced.  To these suc-

this branch failed, manufacture was preserved from expiring by
the fabrication of a little cloth for sacks, by harden, (a stuff
made from the coarsest of the flax,) and by a little linen and
