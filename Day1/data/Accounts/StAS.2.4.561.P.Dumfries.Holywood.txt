        The number of acres imperial measure in this parish may be stated at 8960
        Of which there are in wood,                                           540

	The remainder is all arable.

	Rent of Land.--The best land is let at from L. 2 to L. 2, 6s.
per acre, and the average rent is about L. 1, 5s. per acre. Graz-
ing for a milk cow is L. 4. The leases of the principal farms are
from fifteen to nineteen years. The real rental of the parish, as
nearly as can be ascertained, is L. 7436. The rental in 1790, as
stated in the former Account, was L. 3000.
	Produce.--The produce of the parish has been doubled within
the last thirty years. It is extremely difficult to obtain the exact
produce; but, instead of this, there are presented the ascertained
returns of the land per acre. At one period, the best wheat lands
yielded from 50 to 60 bushels per acre. The average at present may
be stated at from 25 to 30 do. There were individuals who persist-
ed, till lately, to sow wheat, until the return was under 15 bushels
per acre. The deficiency in this species of crop has been occasioned
by improper management; and there can be little doubt, that if the
wheat lands were put under summer fallow, and repeatedly plough-
ed, especially in the heaviest soils, during the season, and well
cleaned, and then fully manured, there would, as formerly, be
available returns of crop.
	The average of oats per acre is from 46 to 55 bushels imperial.
There are lands that produce from 60 to 65 bushels; and one por-
tion of late, newly broken up and improved, produced above 100
bushels per acre.
	Barley yields an average of from 30 to 40 bushels per acre;
best lands 55 to 60 do.
	Ten tons may be given as the average per acre, of the potato
crop; best lands, 15 tons, worth, on an average of seven years,
L. 1, 2s. per ton. The ton at present sells at L. 2, 8s. 4d. This
price is occasioned by the failure of the potato crop in this dis-
