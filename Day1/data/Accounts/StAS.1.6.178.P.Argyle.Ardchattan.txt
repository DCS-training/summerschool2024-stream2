   Population.-According to Dr Webster, the number of in-
habitants in the united parishes amounted, in 1755, to 2195:
now it has increased to between 2300 and 2400.  But it ap-
pears that this district was better peopled a few years ago than
it is at present.  Within these two or three years 140 persons
emigrated from hence to America; and this year more are pre-
paring to follow, being much encouraged by the flattering ac-
counts of the former emigrants.  Several families have re-
moved to the low country, where the wages are high.  The
principal cause of the decrese of population is the engrossing
and uniting several farms, and turning them into sheep-walks.
Farms that formerly supported 8 or 9 families are now oc-
cupied by only 2 or 3, and, in some places, solely by one
shepherd.  But, it must be acknowledged, that the present
proprietors have given preference to the old possessors, and, in
several instances, renewed their leases at a cheaper rate, and
upon easier terms, than have been offered to them by strangers.

of deaths, 28.
