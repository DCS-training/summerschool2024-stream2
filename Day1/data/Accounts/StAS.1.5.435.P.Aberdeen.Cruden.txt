sir the sick.  One circumstance is worth taking notice of,
namely, that of all those, who attended the late wake* of

plaints are most prevalent.

   Waters.-There are no rivers, properly speaking, in the

One at the foot of the rocks at Buller's Buchan, said to be

upon the top of the rock beside Dunbuy, over which the
late Earl of Errol built a house.  This is a very strong
mineral water, though weaker than that of Peterhead.

   Natural Curiositics, etc.-The Pot of Buller's Buchan is so

rock of Dunbuy, to which the migratory birds resort, and

arch to which the kitty-weaks resort, has a ong ravine
near it, of prodigious height, and very narrow, through
which the noise of the waves is so reverberated, as to re-

one above the other, at the E. end of the peninsula of 
Slains castle.  There is a another near them, high up a rock,
