     NUMBER LV.

     PARISH OF SOUTHEND.

     (County of Argyle.)

     By the Rev. Mr DAVID CAMPBELL.

     Situation, Extent, etc.

   THE parish of Southend, in the presbytery of Kintyre,
and synod of Argyle, lies at the extremity of the pe-
ninsula of Kintyre.  Its length, from east to west, is about
11 miles, and its breadth, from north to south, is about
5.-On the north and east, it is bounded by the parish of 
Campbeltoun, and on the west and south, by the Irish sea,
the breadth of which, to Ballycastle, is about 7 leagues.
Between the two  countries, however, there is not much in-
tercourse or commerce.  The Irish bring over some black
cattle, and carry back small horses in return.  A ferry boat
is always in waiting in this parish; the fare of the whole 
boat is 15 s. in summer, and 20 s. in winter.  They some-
times go to the opposite coast in one tide, and return with 
the next.

   Surface, etc.-This parish exhibits a beautiful and varie-
gated  prospect of hills, neither high nor rocky, and vallies,
through four of which small rivers flow; and on each side
of those vallies, there are farm houses at small distances from
each other.  The rivers frequently overflow their banks,
