   Plantations.-The want of inclosures has had the same ef-
fect here, as in other places, of retarding the plantation of
trees: A circumstance to be regretted, as woods and hedge-
rows add to the beauty, and improve the climate of a count-
try.  It gives pleasure to mention, that the principal pro-
prietor of busy in planting the whole of his waste lands,
which must eventually turn to good account.  An acre of
land will contain 1500 trees at 6 feet distance.  In 20 years,
each of these may fell for 2 d,; and this amounting to
l. 12. 10 s. yields a rent of 10 s. yearly.  In planting waste
lands, especially on the declivity of a hill, it would be a
good practice to lay two surrows together with the plough;
which would give the trees planted between them a greater
depth of soil; and what is of still greater advantage, the
ground would be kept dry, and the trees, on that account,
thrive much better.

   Birds of Passage, etc.-Dotterels, rails and woodcocks,
visit this parish.  At their first appearance dotterels are ve-
ry tame; but after having been shot at they become re-
markably wild.  They have become much rarer, since the
country was improved.  Woodcocks come here in the end
of September, and remain till April; one of them built a
nest in this neighbourhood; but the nest and eggs were de-
stroyed.  We have a few grouse; and which are consider-
ably larger in size than upon the Grampians.
