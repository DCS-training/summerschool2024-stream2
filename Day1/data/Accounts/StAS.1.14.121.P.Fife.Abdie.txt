the statistical accounts of neighbouring parishes: like
their neighbours they have meliorated the soil by their
improvements, and much increased the annual returns of
grain.  On one farm containing a considerable quantity
of low ground, adjoining to the Tay, and subjected for-
merly to the tides, the tenant, a young man of laudable
enterprise, and perservering industry, has, in a great mea-

subject of embanking, to which this Article has led, is a

The current of the river, alas! gradually wears away
many acres of the finest soil in this part of the country.
Within the memory of some persons living, whole fields

Most of them rear occationally black cattle, and draught
horses for sale.
   There are no sheep-farms, property so called, within
the parish, though several of the farmers keep small
socks of sheep, as in the contigous parishes, for pastu-
ring their high grounds, amounting, in whole, to about
60 scores.  Formerly, the number of sheep was much
greater, and the management of them, more carefully
