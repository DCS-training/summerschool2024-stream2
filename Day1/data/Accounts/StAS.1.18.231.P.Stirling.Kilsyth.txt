ty of other places: excepting at Banton, in the east barony,
it has not been wrought to any considerable extent; but it is
upwards of 25 years since it was first wrought there by the
Carron Company; and it continues to be wrought to a con-
siderable extent, still furnishing generally about 5000 tons
every year.  The number of miners has been various, but in
general from 50 to 60; and as there is still a great field re-
maining, it may employ as many hands, and furnish as great
a quantity for many years to come.  It consists in general of
several strata, from 4 to 14 inches thick; separated from each

   In the west barony belonging to Sir Archibald Edmonston,

of all sizes from a quarter of an inch to 12 inches dia-
meter.
   When broken or cut asunder, they exhibit within a great
variety of square partitions; these are generally filled with
white spar, which the old fossilists call septaria.  But I have
seen them quite empty; and beautifully excavated like a
honeycomb.  Being pretty hard, they receive a fine polish;
and they have been wrought up by marble cutters into orna-
ments, in-laid work, or cabinets.  Some of them are truly
beautiful; but their intrinsic value consists in the fine quality
and great quantity of iron which they contain; they are sup-
posed to be the richest that have ever been found.  The Car-
