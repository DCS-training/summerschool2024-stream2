     of the Abbey Parish of Paisley.

zed by the Pope in favour of Lord Claud Hamilton, third
son of the Duke of Chatelherault, in reward of his steady ad-
herence to the cause of Queen Mary; and, in 1588, it was
by the King and Parliament erected into a temporal lordship,
and Lord Claud was created Lord Paisley.  The revenues of
the abbacy were very considerable: They consisted of the
teinds of twenty-eight different parishes, with the property of
the lordships of Paisley, of Kilpatrick in Dunbartonshire, and
of Monkton in Ayrshire, extending each to a hundred merk
land; and the forty pound land of Glen in Lochwinnoch;
with the lands of Achengown, Grange, &c. and a consider-
able detached property in different parts of the kingdom.
All this property, with the patronage of the several churches,
fell to Lord Claud Hamilton, last abbot of Paisley.  It con-
tinued in that family till 1653, when his grandson James Earl
of Abercorn sold the lordship of Paisley to the Earl of Angus,
who next year sold it to William Lord Cochran, Kilpatrick
to Sir John Hamiltoun of Orbistoun, Monktoun to Lord
Bargenny, and Glen to Lord Semple and others.  Great
part of the lordship of Paisley was, at different times, sold off
by the family of Dundonald; and what remained of it was
in 1764 repurchased by the late Earl of Abercorn.  The fa-
bric of the Abbey owed much of its magnificence to Abbot
George Schaw, who, about 1484, enlarged and beautified the
building, surrounding the church, the precincts of the con-
vent, the gardens, and a small deer-park, with a noble wall
of hewn free-stone.  The Abbey was, after the Reformation,
successively the seat of the Earls of Abercorn and Dundonald.
The late Earl of Dundonald demolished the ancient gateway,
and, by feuing off the immediately adjoining grounds for
building, entirely changed the appearance of the place.  As
it was thus rendered totally unfit for a family residence, it
has since that time been let out into separate dwellings, and
