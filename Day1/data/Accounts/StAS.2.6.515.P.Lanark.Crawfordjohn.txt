To these regulations, however, it is much to be regretted, the Jus-
tices themselves have not uniformly adhered.
	Fuel.--Peats of various kinds can be easily got on many farms,
and are still used in considerable quantities by several families.
They are certainly expensive, and are perceived to be so by all
who keep accurate accounts, and form a proper estimate of labour;
and therefore in time they will be less used. Coal is cheap and
more convenient for all purposes,--a cart of it containing between
9 and 10 cwt. costs 2s. at Glespin or Ridgeside in Douglas; and
the driving to the village costs 2s. 6d. more.

			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

	From a register kept by one of the farmers in a centrical part
of the parish, I perceive that, from 1812 to 1835, inclusive, the
earliest day when he began sowing was 14th March 1821, and the
latest 4th April 1827; that the earliest day when he ended his
sowing was 1st April 1827, and the latest 30th April 1827; that the
earliest day when he began reaping was 8th August 1826, and the
latest 16th September 1816; that the earliest when he finished
reaping was 2d September 1826, and the latest 28th October
1816. In 1762, the rental of Gilkerscleugh lands was L. 177,
15s. 6 2/3d.; in 1802 it was L. 522, 1Os.; and in 1835 it is L. 1100.
1 have seen a copy of a receipt of the Laird of Glespin, dated 13th
November 1694, for L. 5, 11s. 4d. Scots, half a year's rent for
Slimanford and Sheriffcleugh, which is 18s. 6 2/3d. Sterling a-year
Now Sheriffcleugh is let for L. 80; Slimanford is let along with
Shawhead for L. 170, and is accounted the third of its value, so that
wd have in 1694, 18s. 6 2/3d. and in 1835, L. 136, 13s. 4d.
	The differences betwixt the present state of the parish and that
at the time when the former Account was written, are many and evi-
dent. In that Account, it is said there were about 20 farms; now
there are 33, besides small pieces let at Abington, and 4 are join-
ed together so as to make only 2. In it, 20 ploughs are said to
have been kept, which laboured merely 30, acres each, making in
all 600 acres; now, there are 114 horses; 620 bolls of oats are
sbwn, 36 of bear, 196 acres are in green crops, and 19,140 stones of
rye-grass hay are raised. In it, the number of black-cattle is said
to have been considerable,--now, there are 666 milch cows, 403
young cows, and 31 bulls. At the time of the former Account, there
was no proprietor who had his lands separated by any fence from
those of his neighbour; now, not only is this in every instance done,
but there are, only three farms in the least improved quarter, which
are not fenced off from each other; and the rest are likewise sub-
