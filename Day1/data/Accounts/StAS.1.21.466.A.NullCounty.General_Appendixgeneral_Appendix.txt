     General Appendix to

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The road from Glasgow
to Carlisle run, through the parish of Wamphray, and is of
essential service to it.  The vicinity of English markets is
convenient for disposing of cattle and sheep.  The character
of the people, which is favourable to industry and economy,
and the nature of the soil, which is almost every where good
and kindly, up to the hill tops, together with the warm fa-
vourable exposure, are all in favour of the parish.  What be-
nefits may be reaped from the marle and freestone, time on-
ly can determine.  We have two threshing mills in the pa-
rish; one going by water, the other moved by horses.  When
these useful machines can be constructed at such a moderate
expence, as to be within the farmer's reach, the advantage
will be very great.  A better sort of milk cattle would cer-
tainly be essentially useful; and perhaps it would be advan-
tageous on some farms to alter the sheep stock, and intro-
duce a kind having better wool.  Quarries of whinstone might
probably be got in the hills, for fences against sheep; as
most of the hedges are almost destroyed by the trespasses of
cattle, and the labour of upholding any other fence than a
stone dyke is much against it.  A few years will operate a
change in most of these particulars.  It has hitherto been
much for the advantage of this parish that great part of it
was in the hands of the Earl of Hopeton.  When his Lord-
ship shall think proper to dispose of his valuable estate here,
there is not one tenant on his lands that will be out of
mourning.
   The great drawbacks, are the distance from the lime and
coals; the scarcity of good peat; and dearth and difficulty of
getting labourers and servants.  I may add the want of a
good flax mill, to encourage the growth of that article.  But
what people are in possession of every advantage?  We have
enough, if we improve it, and are duly thankful to the Au-
thor of all our comforts.
