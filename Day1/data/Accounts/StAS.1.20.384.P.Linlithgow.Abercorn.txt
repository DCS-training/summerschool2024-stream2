of a stream or river, or the point where the influx takes
place; and I have been informed that Cornie or Curnig, in
the same language, signifies rotten trees.  If this be the im-
port of these words, Abercorn or Abercurnig, according to
the ancient orthography, signifies the point at the influx of
the rivulet or burn of the rotten trees.
   Buchanan has offered a singular conjecture concerning the
origin of this name.  He supposes it may have been deri-
ved from the Cornavii, who were placed by Ptolemy in
Caithness and Cornwall.  "In hoc tractu, (Cathanesia),
"Ptolemaeus collocat Cornavios, cujus nominis adhuc vesti-
"gia quaedam restant.  Videntur et in media insula, ob-
"scura quidem illa, sed hujus tamen nominis vestigia re-
"mansisse.  Valli enim Severi initium scribit Beda non
"procul abesse a caenobio Aebercurnig, et monasterii qui-
"dem illic nullum indicium in illis locis est relictum: ma-
"net autem non procul illinc semidiruta Duglassiorum arx,
"Abercornum nomine.  Horum autem vocabulorum u-
"trumque an alterum fit a Kernico corruptum, lectori di-
"judicandam relinquo*."  It may be presumed, few readers
will judge favourably of this fanciful etymology.
