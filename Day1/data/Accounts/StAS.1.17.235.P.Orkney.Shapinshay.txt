battle or victory, or to preserve the memory of some cele-
brated hero who had fallen in the field of battle.  Towards
the north side of the island, and by the sea side, is another
large stone, called the Black Stone of Odin.  Instead of
standing erect, like the one above mentioned, it rests its huge
side on the sand, and raises its back high above the surroun-
ding stones, from which it seems to be altogether different
in quality.  How it has come there, for what purpose, and
what relation it has borne to the Scandinavian god with
whose name it has been honoured, not only history or re-
cord, but even tradition is totally silent.  As the bay in a
neighbouring island is distinguished by the name of Guuden,
or the Bay or Guo of Odin, in which there is found dulce
that is supposed to prevent disease and prolong life; so
this stone might have had sanctity formerly which is now
forgotten, when the only office that is assigned it is to
serve as a march-stone between the ware strands or kelp
shores of two conterminous heritors.  On the west shore,
opposite nearly to the rock or skerry of Vasa, where the tides
are rapid and the sea is shallow, we meet with a place known
by the name of Grucula or Agricola.  Thither, tradition re-
ports, one of Agricola's ships, in his celebrated voyage a-
round the island of Britain, was driven by violence of wea-
ther, and stranded; and what seems to evince that the tra-
dition is founded on truth is, that Roman coins are said to have
been found here, by the late Mr Fea of Clestron.  Though
Agricola's son-in-law, Tacitus, not only mentions his having
been in these islands, but also his having conquered them,
and discovered Thule, till then involved in darkness, and co-
vered with snow, no such disaster is described by his strong
and elegant pencil.  From his silence, however, we cannot
justly infer the event never happened, especially as he men-
tions the Orkneys in such a rapid and superficial manner.
