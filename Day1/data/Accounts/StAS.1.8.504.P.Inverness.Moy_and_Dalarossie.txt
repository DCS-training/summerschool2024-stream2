it rises very rapidly, and falls at times very suddenly.  There
is but 1 bridge over it, through the whole of this course;
and the people at a distance from the bridge, having frequent
occasion to cross the river, often attempt to ford it in an im-
proper state, by which many lives are lost.  This river
abounds with a great variety of trouts; some salmon are also
found in it within the bounds of this parish, especially in sea-
sons that have frequent speats or floods, that enable the
salmon to get over the rocks, which obstruct their passage
when the river is low.  There are a number of lesser
streams and rivulets in the parish, but none of them of such
importance as to deserve particular notice.

   Lake, Island, etc.-The Lake of Moy is the only consider.
able one in this parish.  By an actual measurement of it, taken
on the ice, its greatest length is 1 3/4, and the greater breadth
3/4 of a mile.  This lake abounds with charr (commonly call-
ed red wames), and a great variety of other trouts, of differ-
ent sizes and colours.  About the middle of the lake there is
an island, consisting of about 2 acres of ground.  It lies N.
and S., and is nearly the shape of a violin.  At the south end
of the island, there are the remains of a house, containing 4
fire rooms, where the Lairds of Mackintosh resided in times of
trouble.  By an inscription above the gate, it is said to have
been built in the year 1665, by Lauchlan the 20th Laird of
Mackintosh.  Adjoining to the house, there is a garden, plant-
ed with fruit trees and currant bushes.  It appears, by
the ruins still remaining, that there have formerly been very
extensive buildings in this island.  The remains of a street,
the whole length of the island, with the foundations of houses,
on each side, are still very visible; and in the year 1760, two
ovens were discovered, each capable to contain 4 bushels of
