	It may be here remarked, that the parish can boast of no family
of noble blood; and that almost all depend, more or less, on some
line of business as a means of subsistence. The number of pro-
prietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards, who are
resident in the parish, and have property within the same, is two;
and even these are only feuars from the corporation of Arbroath.
        The people do not appear to be remarkable for any peculiarity
in strength, size, or complexion, or other personal quality. As is
common in most places, the appearance of a man indicates in some
measure the trade or occupation which he follows; and, perhaps,
a degree of huskiness in the voice may be viewed as characteristic
of the females employed at spinning-mills. In the census of 1831,
9 males and 15 females were returned as insane orfatuous; 2
males and 3 females as blind; and 1 male and 3 females as deaf
and dumb.
	Language, Habits, and General Character of the People.-- The
language generally spoken is the Forfarshire dialect of the Scot-
