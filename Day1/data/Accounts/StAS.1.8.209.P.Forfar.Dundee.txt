But the annual average of the marriages, for the 5 years, imme-
diately preceding 1766, is 140; and as 140 to 12,426, the ac-
tual number of inhabitants, in 1766, so is 85 to 7544.  The
average number of marriages again for the 5 years preceding
1781, is 149, and as 149 to 15,700, so is 85 to 8957; and, in
like manner, as 215, the average number of the marriages for
the 5 years preceding 1788, is to 19,329, so is 85 to 7641.
These are the three results for the number of the inhabitants
in 1651; the medium of the three brings it out 8,047; and,
it is probable, that this conjecture does not err widely from
the truth.  It is true, that a similar comparison, instituted be-
tween the averages of the baptisms, at there different periods,
would bring out in 1651, a population not less than 12,597;
but more respect seems, on many accounts, to be due to the
register of marriages, than to that of baptisms.  All marriages,
whether regular or not, have hitherto been carefully record-
ed; but, besides that many neglect, or find it inconvenient, to
record their children's names, (and these omissions are much
more readily overlooked, in large places, than in small), it is
to be observed, that previous to 1651, there were few or no
sectaries; whereas, since the revolution in 1688, and especi-
ally, since the rise of the Independents and Seceders, about
1732, many have thought registration in the records of the
Established Church, inconsistent with their religious prin-
ciples:  consequently, the number of recorded baptisms, must
now bear a less proportion to the number of inhabitants than
it did formerly; and, the result, for the former population,
which is drawn from them, must come out too great,
   The loss of people in the siege by Monk, and especially in
the carnage at the storming of the town, appears, on many ac-
counts, to have been great, and cannot be estimated at much
less than a sixth part of the whole inhabitants.  Of 159 children,
