   Advantages of Public Lecturing.-In those universities where
the professors are uniformly employed in lecturing, it may be
expected that the matter of their lectures will correspond,
in some measure, to the general progress of science and lite-
rature in their several departments.  A professor, whose con-
sequence and livelihood depend upon the approbation given
by the public to his lectures, will find it necessary to study
the principal authors upon the subject: he will imbibe, in
some degree, the taste of the age in which he lives, and avail
himself of the increase of knowledge and new discovery: he
will find it expedient to model his instructions in the manner
most likely to suit the purposes, and to promote the interest
of his students.  By going frequently over the same subject,
he has a chance to correct the erroneous opinions which he
might formerly have admitted; and, according to the scale
of his understanding, to attain the most liberal and compre-
hensive views of his science.  If he is possessed, at the same
time, of taste and abilities, he can hardly avoid acquiring an
enthusiastic attachment to the objects of his prosession, and
an ardent desire, of propagating those improvements in it
which appear to him of importance.
   In colleges where no lectures are given, and where the
reading and prelecting on certain books, in a private manner,
make the chief object of the teacher, the same dispositions
and views will seldom occur.  The prosessor, having little
temptation to study, in any particular manner, that science
with which he is nominally connected, will be apt to possess
but a superficial knowledge of it, and to have little zeal in
communicating new ideas or discoveries concerning it.  In
such a situation, the prejudices and contracted views of lite-
rature, which formerly prevailed, and which were natural
upon the immediate revival of letters, may remain to the pre-
sent day; and the name of scholar be restricted to a mere
