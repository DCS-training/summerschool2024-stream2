     of Orwel.

It is bounded by the parishes of Arngask and Forteviot on
the north; by Kinross on the south; by Portnoak and
Strathmeiglo on the east; and by that of Foffaway on the
west; being between 5 and 6 miles in length from east to
west, and about 5 miles in breadth from north to south.
   It is 16 miles from the North Ferry, and 14 from Perth.
The great road to Perth leads through the village of Millne-
thort, in the centre of the parish.

   Surface and Soil.-This parish lies almost perfectly flat:
north from the village it rises gradually to the top of the
high grounds called Kinross-brae, which braes are the termi-
nations of the Ochil-hills; the height of which, here, will not
be above 760 feet above the level of the sea.  There is not
much of this parish either in moor or moss; the far greater
part of it consists in excellent pasture for cattle, or in culti-
vation.
   The soils are various.  The farms which lie to the south of
the parish, bordering upon the Queegh +, are a mixture of
clay and sand, and yield about 5 bolls an acre.  The farms
situated on the north of the village are of a light sandy soil,
and yield about 6 bolls an acre.  The lands about the vil-
lage are reckoned as good as any in the shire, and afford ex-
cellent crops, and generally have an early harvest.
   Inclosures about the village rent at 40 s. per acre, and
some parks even at 50 s. per acre.  Upon an average, the
one-half of the lands of this parish are nearly divided and in-
closed with good stone-dikes and fences.  For the produce
and quantity of the crops see the table.

   Minierals.-There is no coal in this parish hitherto dis-
covered; but in the neighbouring parishes there are plenty
of peats, which are used by the poorer sort of people.
