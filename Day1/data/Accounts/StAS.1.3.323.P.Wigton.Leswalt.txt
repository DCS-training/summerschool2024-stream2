of the parish, close upon Stranraer, and separated from it
only by an ideal line, called the Clayhole and Hillhead,
which contains near one half of the inhabitants of the parish.
Mr Vans Agnew is the proprietor of the ground on which
these villages stand.  He lets it out in small lots for building
houses, at an easy feu duty of 3 d. a foot in front of a house,
and allows 100 feet behind the house for garden ground.
Such as choose to slate their houses, are exempted from feu-
duty for four years, and this has encouraged many to make
use of slate.  The inhabitants of the villages are generally
tradesmen, sailors, and labourers; and some of them rent
small pieces of ground.
