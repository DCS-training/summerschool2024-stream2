   The muirlands are in general most profitably employed in
rearing black cattle and sheep; though in many places their
are arable, and might on every farm supply the quantity of
corn consumed by the feuars and tenants.

   Agriculture in the Carses.-Rotation of Crops.-A farm is
divided into six parts.  The first part is laid down in fallow,
the second part in wheat, the third in beans, the fourth in
barley, the fifth in grass, the sixth in oats.  The rotation on
each of these six parts is the same, viz. fallow, wheat, beans,
barley, grass, oats.  The only difference consists in the crop
with which the rotation begins.  The first part begins with
fallow, etc. according to the present condition of the land.

   Tillage.-The fallow whilst preparing for a crop of
wheat, is ploughed six times, if the weather be favourable;
the fields for beans or oats once, for barley thrice or four
times; grasses are usually sown with the barley.

   Manure.-Eight chalders of lime are allowed to an acre.
The lime is thrown on the fallow after the fifth plowing,
and immediately before the sixth plowing, when the wheat is
sown.  Dung is laid on the ground that is preparing for
barley; seventy carts are allowed to an acre.  No other ma-
nure, for the most part, is employed during one rotation of
six years.

   Seed and Produce.-Two firlots of wheat sown on an acre,
return from eight to ten bolls.  Three firlots of barley sown
on an acre, return seven bolls.  One boll or five firlots of
oats sown on an acre, return six or seven bolls.  Five or six
firlots of beans sown on an acre, return seven or eight bolls.
Two firlots of rye grass, with six or eight pounds of clover
