tain it is, that the church of Falkirk, as it now stands, has
not all been built at the same time.  In the year 1166, it
was given* to the monastery of Holyroodhouse by the
Bishop of St Andrew's; and as the parishes belonging to
these religious foundations were often not properly attend-
ed to with respect to religious instruction and accommoda-
tion, so it is not improbable that the church of this parish
might have been permitted to fall into ruin, and thence the
name under consideration might have taken its rise.
   An Eglais bhrec, the latter of the Gaelic designations
which I mentioned, signifies the Spotted Church.  To this
name Buchanan, who understood the Gaelic language, gives
his support, for in his History of Scotland he calls Falkirk,
"Varium Sacellum."  It is supposed by some, that it got
that designation from the party-coloured appearance of the
stones in the building.
   As the wall of Antoninus, which will afterwards be de-
scribed, passed very near the church, and where a part of
the town is built, some are of opinion, that the present
name of this place is derived from Vallum and Kirk, which
by an easy transition, became Falkirk, thereby signifying
the Church upon the Wall.
   The greater part of this parish is inclosed and subdivided,
as well as enriched by trees, villas, and gentlemens seats.
The numerous fine trees which are in Callander park and
its neighbourhood, together with the wood belonging to
the same place, add much to the pleasantness of the town
of Falkirk; as it is situated in the immediate vicinity of
these rural and enlivening objects.  From the manse, and
other places on the north side of the town, the prospect is
delightful, and comprehends a fertile and well-cultivated
country of 12 or 14 miles square, which is bounded by the
