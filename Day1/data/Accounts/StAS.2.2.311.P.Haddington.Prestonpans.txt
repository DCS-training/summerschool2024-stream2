sway around that simple monument of departed greatness.	It is
the property of the Chapmen of the Lothians, and is said to have
been acquired by them in 1636. It is supposed by some anti-
quaries that the company referred to are the modern representa-
tives of that most respectable fraternity, and it is worthy of remark,
that, according to common report, the descendants of those  most
useful persons are men no less deserving of public confidence and
respect, than their mercantile progenitors were.
   Ruin at Dolphingston.-In the hamlet of this name, through
which is the great road to London, are several broken walls and
gables, obviously of very ancient erection. From the peculiar af-
fection cherished by the monks for this district of country, it is cer-
tainly allowable, in the absence of any distinct information regard-
ing their origin and use, to suppose that here they had another
Pleasant and profitable abode.
   Land-owners.-The chief proprietors in the parish are, Sir
George Grant Suttie, Bart. of Balgone and Prestongrange, pa-
tron of the parish; William Aitchison, Esq. of Drummore; George
Sime, Esq. of Northfield; John Fowler, Esq. of Hallidoun and
Burnrigg; the Trustees of Schaw's Hospital; the Trustees of
George Watson's Hospital; Colonel Macdowall of Logan; Mrs
Gowans; Sir William Hamilton, Bart. of Preston and Fingalton;
the Heirs of the late Miss Clapperton; and William Cockburn,
Esq. of Preston Cottage.
   The number of acres under cultivation is 739. The rental is
L. 2929, 2s. 10d.
   Parochial Registers.-During the last century, the records of
session have been kept with considerable care. Between the years
1600 and 1690, there are several important blanks. It is serious-
ly to be feared that the volumes awaiting are irrecoverably lost.
The earliest entry is in the register of births and marriages. Its
date is 1596; 1601 is the earliest date in the record of discipline.
It is supposed, that there are few more venerable registers any-
where than, in this parish. Unfortunately, the apparently sportive
variations in the writing have hitherto rendered the treasures of
wisdom concealed in them accessible to an expert few alone.
