	In the period since, 1772, the greatest amount of population oc-
curred in 1792, when it reached to 1962, of which, 1072 belonged
to the town. In the country, the numbers have not at any time
greatly varied, and it might seem singular, that in the seaport of
Stonehaven, the population since 1792 has apparently decreased.
But this admits of explanation. The ground within the bounds
of the burgh, which is the Dunnottar part of the town, having
been nearly all occupied, building between fifty and sixty years
ago began to extend to the north side of the Carron, in the ad-
joining parish of Fetteresso, where a new town was planned, and
feu-rights granted, by Mr Barclay of Ury, on his lands of Ardu-
thie. In this way, Stonehaven had increased so as to contain in
both parishes, according to the census of 1831, a population of up-
wards of 3000, being more than triple the town population of 1772.
It is supposed a farther increase has taken place since the date of
that census./f*  The average annual number of marriages in Dunnot-
tar is 14, and of bhrths 34. There are five insane persons main-
tained at the expense of the parish, and there is one deaf and
dumb person, a young, man, educated at the asylum in Aberdeen,
who is industrious and intelligent, and affords a gratifying exam-
ple of the important benefits flowing from such institutions. Each
of the land-owners of the parish possesses property greatly exceed-
ing in revenue the sum of L.50. Not one of them is resident. No
feuar in the Dunnottar quarter of Stonehaven has a rental of that
amount. The people in general are attentive to their religious
and moral duties. Indulgence in the use of intoxicating liquors
is fast disapppearing.
