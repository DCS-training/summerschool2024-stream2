as the produce of last fishing season. The cost of the boat may
be about L. 10, of the sail L. 2, and of the nets about L. 1 each.
The boat will last twelve or fifteen years, the nets not more than
two years; but the boats often meet with accidents, and the nets
are still oftener drifted out to sea by high winds, and either seri-
ously injured or altogether lost. From eight to twenty nets are
used by each boat.
	Produce.--The gross annual produce raised in the parish may
be taken at very nearly as under, viz.

	Means of Communication.--There is no market-town, and but,
One village in the parish. It is around the church, and consists of
eighty-four houses. The chief market-town for the farm produce
of the parish is Girvan, distant twelve miles and a-half to the nnrth.
Stranraer distant seventeen miles south, is another good market-
town, but in it much less business from the parish is done. The
roads to both towns are now excellent. The length of turnpike
roads in the parish is eleven miles in one direction, and about five
in another, and two in a third. A number of excellent parish roads
branch out from these.
	There is a post-office in the village. The mail from Ireland
to Glasgow passes northward every day at six o'clock in the even-
ing, from Glasgow southward about one o'clock in the morning.
Since October last (1835) the mails have been conveyed by a two-
horse mail coach; before, they were conveyed in; mail gigs. For se-
veral years, the steam-boat from Stranraer to GlasLow has called
at Ballantrae, both in going and returning, during, the summer
