   Manufactures, etc.-The only manufacture, carried on here,
is a coarse kind of stockings, in which almost all the women
are engaged, The wool is dispersed over the country by dif-
ferent manufacturers in Aberdeen, whole servants collect the
stockings, and pay for the knitting.  This branch of trade
has been of very great benefit to the district.  They get from
10d. to 1s. for knitting each pair; and a good hand will spin
and knit 3 pairs a week.  It is computed, that there are about
9000 pairs manufactured annually in this parish, which, at an
average, bring in about 400 L.

*Of these there are 600 acres of good croft, or infield, which let, at an average, at
16 s., 18 s. per acre.  The outfield, some of which is very poor, lets at 4s.

   +Besides a pretty large extent of heath and sheep pasture.

   ++These ploughs are drawn, by 8, 10, and some by 12 oxen; and 5 or 6 drawn by
horses and oxen, or cows, yoked together, The ploughs are of the old Scotch kind, and
generally of a very bad construction.  There is only 1 plough, drawn by a pair of horses,
in the parish.  In the year 1752, there was not one cart in the parish.  The inhabitants
then carried out these farm dung in creeks on horse backs, and brought home their fuel
in summer in the same manner.  This slovenly practice is now almost entirely laid aside,
the farmers having all got carts.

   ^The price of meal is here computed at 10 s. per boll.
