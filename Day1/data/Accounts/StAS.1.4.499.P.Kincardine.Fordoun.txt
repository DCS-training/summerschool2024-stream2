There are many who suppose that the castle at Kincardine
was not Kenneth's but Finella's castle.

   Eminent Men.-This parish is remarkable for having
been for some time the residence, and probably the burial-
place of St Palladius, who was sent by Pope Celestine into
Scotland some time in the 5th century, to oppose the Pelagian
heresy, and by whom it is thought bishops were first ap-
pointed in Scotland, having before that time been governed
by monks.  That Palladius resided, and was probably buried
here, appears from several circumstances.  There is a house
which still remains in the church-yard, called St Palladius's
chapel, where, it is said, the image of the saint was kept,
and to which pilgrimages were performed from the most
distant parts of Scotland.  There is a well at the corner of
the minister's garden, which goes by the name of Paldy
well.-This parish is farther remarkable in having been, if
not the birth-place, at least, the temporary residence, and
probably the burial-place of John Fordoun, author of the
Scotichronicon, one of the most ancient and most authentic
histories which have been published of Scotland.  He
is thought by some to have been a man of property in this
parish; by others, with greater probability, to have been a
monk who resided here.-This parish has also given birth
to the present Lord Monboddo, a man well known in the 
literary world by his writings on ancient metaphysics, and
on the origin and progress of language.

     Miscellaneous Observations.-In the south side of the pa-
rish, the fuel commonly used is coal, which is brought
from Stonehaven or John's haven, the distance 10 English

shore, at 8 s. and 9 s. Sterling.  A barrel, that is 12 stone
of English coals, is sold for 1 s. 6 d. and 1 s. 8 d.  In the
