crops of oats, and one of barley.  With the barley, rye-grass
and clover are sown, of which hay is made in the ensuing
summer, and sometimes for two summers.  They afterwards
pasture for two or more years, as they judge requisite to
give the ground a sufficient rest, before the same rotation
be repeated.  In the flat lands, wheat has been tried with suc-
cess, and has been found to suffer less damage than other
crops, by the floods, from which these grounds are, notwith-
standing the embankment, not yet effectually secured.  Po-
tatoes are raised sufficient for home consumpt, and some to
spare for the Glasgow market, where they generally draw
from 8 d. to 1 s. per water peck.  From the few trials that
have been made, there is much encouragement for the culti-
vation of turnip.  The black cattle are mostly small, and the
farmers not very attentive to improve the breed of their milk
cows.

   Roads.-The multiplicity of roads renders it impossible, by
the conversion of the statute labour, to put them all in a pro-

both masters and tenants, how far the improvement of the
country, and their own private interest, might be promoted,
by shutting up some of the roads that are of least public uti-
lity, and by making an extraordinary exertion for a year or
two, to put the rest once in good repair, after which the
road-money would be sufficient to keep them so.  A good
turnpike road has lately been made, passing through the skirts
of this parish, from the thriving and now populous village of
Balfrone to Glasgow.  It is thought that, by directing it
nearer the centre of this parish, a saving of a mile and a half
at least might have been made in a distance of nine miles.

   Price of Labour and Provisions.-A good ploughman re-
ceives, besides his board, from 5 L. to 7 L. per half year, and a
