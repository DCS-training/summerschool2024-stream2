Forth, which separates it from the parishes of Kilmadock,
Kincardine, and Port.  On the east, it marches with Gar-
gunnock; on the south, with Balfron; and on the west,
with the parish of Drymen.  The road from Stirling to Dun-
barton passes through this parish for 7 miles; it is more,
however, than 8 miles in length, between the distant extre-
mities.  Its breadth is unequal; generally from 2 to 3 miles;
at the middle of the parish, it is nearly 4 miles broad.

   Boundaries of Stirling and Perth Shires.-One might have
expected that the river Forth, which forms a natural limit to
this parish for several miles, should have also served as a
boundary to the shire of Perth.  This county however, in
two or three places, passes over this natural limit, and be-
comes indented in the county of Stirling; so that about one
third part of the parish of Kippen, lies in Perthshire, the
other two thirds in Stirlingshire.  Such an irregularity seems
now surprising.  But it is well known, that ancient proprie-
tors had influence to get such portions of their estates as they
chose, disjoined from those counties within which they were
locally situated, and connected with such other counties, as
better suited their convenience.  Other instances of this kind,
and more remarkable than in the case before us, might easily
be adduced in support of this observation*.

   General Aspect of the Country.-From some of the higher
grounds, an ample and variegated prospect presents itself to
the eye of the spectator.  At the head of the strath, stands

*Some lands in the parishes of Bonhill and Kilmaronnock, which formerly
belonged to the laird of Gleneagles, and of which he is still superior, were
once connected with the shire of Perth, though they lie at a considerable dis-
tance from the limits of that county.
