     Statistical Account

can be no excuse; as much more is wanted at most farms
in the course of the year, and it does not suffer by being
employed in the manner I have mentioned.
   Many, by hurrying in their beans to the corn-yard in
1785, lost them and the fodder.  I delayed touching mine
till the last day of November; and in the night-time, with
moon light, and a brisk breeze of wind from the west,
got them all out of danger; beans are a hardy grain, and
will remain long in the field, without receiving injury from
the weather.  I know no part of husbandry in this parish
in which farmers are more apt to err, than in the manage-
ment of their beans, by taking them too quickly off the
field; if not sufficiently dry, and even blackened, the fod-
der and grain are both spoiled.
   The soil in this parish, whether it be a sandy or clay
soil, is excellently calculated for raising beans.  They are
all sown in the broadcast; in this manner they have more
fodder, but less grain, than if they were sown in drills and
hoed; but the fodder is so valuable for horses, (in my opi-
nion nearly equal to hay and oats), that there are great in-
ducements to continue this practice.  Next to turnips, po-
tatoes, or fallow, they are the best preparing crop for grass.
It is rare to see beans in the higher parts of the county;
but they deserve to be introduced, as I know few crops
more valuable.

   Births.-It is not possible to ascertain the number of
births from the session-register, as many people decline en-
tering their childrens names in the record.  Since the pro-
posal of a Statistical Account, I have inserted in a private
register all that I have baptized.  The result is as follows,
for three years, from the 31 st March 1791 to the same
date 1794, 136 males, and 109 females; total 245; at an
average each year, nearly 82.  From all the information
