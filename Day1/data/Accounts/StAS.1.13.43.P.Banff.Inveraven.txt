dalloch, a few long stones inclosing a small piece of ground,
which was said to be a Druidical temple.  The most of the
stones have been taken away, except one very broad,
thick and long stone, which stands still there:  And oppo-
site to this, on the west side of Aven, upon a rising ground
amidst the corn-land of Bellaviller, is such another place, 
where several long, broad stones, encompass about 72
square yards of ground; some of the long stones are bro-
ken, but several of them still stand whole.  Such another
temple there is in the lower end of Glenlivet, on the east
side of Aven, upon a hillock, or small rising ground, a lit-
tle below the mouth of Livet, called the Doun of Dilmore.
I never heard that oaks grew around those places; but
there are oaks growing between the water of Aven and
the temple, near Ballendalloch; and there grow oaks on
the west side of Aven, opposite to that at Delmore, but 
none grow near to that at Bellaville.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are only two houses
where the ferry-boats on Spey and Aven are kept, that
sometimes keep a dram of whisky to accommodate passen-
gers who may lodge with them, but seldom have ale.
There are also two stills for aquivitae, or whisky, in the pa-
rish.  This spirit is no doubt hurtful to the constitution, and
also to the morals of the people.-I know only four houses
or cottages which have been pulled down and lest uninha-
bitable within the last ten years, and four that have been
new built in that space of time.-The fuel here used is
peats, of which there is no scarcity in a dry year, because
in every corner of the parish there is plenty of moss, or of
that black, soft, oozy ground from which peats are digged;
but the peats are not in all parts equally good.  Some are
of an excellent quality, hard, when dried, make strong fire,
