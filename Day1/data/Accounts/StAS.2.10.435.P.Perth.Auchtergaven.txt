sion-house in the parish deserving of particular notice.  Since the
death of the proprietor, immediately preceding the present, in 1834,
it has remained uninhabited, except by a gardener and his family.
The parish church, two dissenting meeting-houses, the extensive
cotton-mills at Stanley, and five corn-mills, are the principal pub-
lic buildings in the parish.  With the exception of the Stanley
cotton-mills which are chiefly constructed of brick, all these edi-
fices are built of sandstone found in the parish, and covered with
slates, also found in the parish, or in that of Little Dunkeld.  Home-
grown fir has been also extensively used in some of these buildings.
Thus the parish contains an ample store of most kinds of building
materials, for the clay out of which bricks are made is also found
in it.

<TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>

                        III.-POPULATION.
The population in 1755, from Dr Webster's return, was         1677
In 1795, according to the last Statistical Account, it was    1784
In 1811, there were   1188 males,    1369 females,  Total,    2557
   1821,              1164           1314                     2478
   1831,              1599           1818                     3417
   No reason is assigned in the old Statistical Account for the in-
crease of 107, which, according to the preceding statement, occur-
red between the years 1755 and 1795.  In the census of 1811, the
population of Tullybeagles was included,-a fact which sufficiently
accounts for the excess of the census of that year above that of
1821.  Indeed, the wonder is, that the decrease of 1821 was not
much greater than the figures indicate, namely, 79, for the popu-
lation of Tullybeagles is now upwards of 200; and in the period
between 1811 and 1821, the parish was not only in a state of transi-
tion from small to large farms, but the Stanley cotton-mills remahned
idle from 1814 till 1823.  The great increase of nearly a thousand,
which took place between 1821 and 1831, arose from the operation
of two very obvious causes,-the activity and extension of the Stan-
ley cotton-mills, and the erection of two entirely new villages on
the property of Jalds Wylie, Esq. of Airlywight.  In the two last
census, the population of Tullybeagles was included in that of the
parish of Methven, to which, indeed, the district belongs quoad om-
nia; at least there is no record of its having been annexed to this
parish quoad sacra; although, for the convenience of the inhabi-
tants, it has always in reality been so, as both minister and people
act on the principle that it so annexed.  A considerable number
of individuals, both male and female, has of late years emigrated
from the parish, but not to the sensible diminution of the popula-
