     The Statistical Account.

raising and removing the surface stones, he has, by a trench-
ing plough, torn in more than twenty acres of stony, barren
heath, repeatedly and in different directions ploughed it,
taken off the stones, and divided it into small fields with
straight ridges.  Besides lime in sufficient quantity, he has
brought dung from Aberdeen, on the whole at a great ex-
pence, laying it down, after turnip and grain, with grass
seeds.  It formerly was of no value, and seems improved at
too high a cost for the short and uncertain term of lease.
Such exertion deserves encouragement.  Some acres more of
detached pieces are brought likewise from a barren state; and
about ten acres of moor are in progress of cultivation, and
will complete the rendering wholly arable Torryhill, the top
of which lay barren in the midst of a cultivated country.-
Some individuals have begun to follow Mr Innes's example,
in taking in ground with the plough from the moor.
   But the most particular account of the manner of improve-
ment, on a considerable portion of the lately divided and
feued ground, appears from a letter, on the subject of the
cultivation of his feus, by Mr David Morice, advocate in
Aberdeen.  As it also contains some articles which seem in-
teresting and beneficial, and mentions some further particulars
of the natural history of the parish, it is here inserted, except
a few circumstances, and will give considerable information
on the subject.
