two principal heritors, the Earl of Dumfries and Mr. Boswell
of Auchinleck, have never refused the late incumbent money
for the relief of the poor when necessary.

   Antiquities and Remarkable Places, etc.-In an angle, form-
ed by the Lugar and the Dupol burn, there are the remains
of the old Castle of Auchinleck, of whose age there is not the
smallest account to be found.  Near this castle there are three
remarkably straight and tall fir trees, planted in the last cen-
tury by one of the Boswells of Auchinleck, who brought the
plants in his boot from Dalziel near Hamilton.  Next the
castle, lies the Place of Auchinleck, in a romantically plea-
sant situation; and about half a mile from thence, the House
of Auchinleck, built by the late worthy LORD AUCHINLECK.
Ayr's Moss, in this parish, is famous for a defeat of a party of
the Covenanters in Charles II's time.  On a green know
therein, is a tomb-stone to the memory of Mr. Richard Came-
ron, preacher of the gospel, and seven others, killed in the
engagement.  At the head of this moss, which extends
miles in length, and 1 in breadth, there are the remains of
an iron forge, erected at a great expence by a Lord Cathcart,
but suddenly given up, even when bar iron was manufactured
there.
