     of Peterhead.

   In 1783, the meteor so generally taken notice of was
observed here.  I was from home, about 20 miles from this
town, in a chaise, after sunset, when there was a thick fog;
a sudden light came into the chaise like a flash of light-
ning.  The lunar rainbow, which by some people is rec-
koned a rare object, has been frequently observed here.

   Land Animals.-There are no quadrupeds or birds pecu-
liar to this parish; a few, however, may be mentioned.
There are, besides domestic animals, the fox, polecat, otter,
weasel, hare, mole, ground mice, and water rats; I have
never heard of a badger being seen here, though I am not
certain but they may be found, as I once saw one which
was killed in the parish of Longside, a few miles from this
place.

   Birds.-The cuckoo, lapwing, corn-rail, woodcock, field-
fare, bat, blackbird, and swallow, make their appearance
regularly once in the year at different seasons.  I once saw,
in the end of the year, 2 or 3 woodpeckers, but they were
never observed afterwards.  There are various species of
hawks, and a few owls; an eagle was once killed in this
parish, the only one I have heard of being observed
during my residence here; swans sometimes pass over the
town, but do not settle here; wild-geese are very frequent-
ly to be found in the parish during the autumn and winter;
when an intense frost has set in for some time, vast flocks of
wild-geese, of a smaller size than what are commonly found
here, pass over the bay of Peterhead in one direction, half-
way betwixt the manse and the town of Peterhead, one
flock succeeding another, during the greatest part of the
day; they all pass to the northward, but where their settle
at that time is uncertain; it is supposed they go to some
lochs in the Highlands, which never freeze.  Solan geese
