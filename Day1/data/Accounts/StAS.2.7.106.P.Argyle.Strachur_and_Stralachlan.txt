1500 acres imperial constantly waste or pasture lands, which
have never been in cultivation, to abbot 36,000.  There may be
from 1600 to 2000 acres under wood of all descriptions.
   The black-faced sheep and Highland cattle are the common
breeds, and to their improvement much attention has of late been
paid by the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, and
by an Association of proprietors and farmers connected with the
Cowal district.
   There are several excellent farm-buildings occupied by the large
tenants, such as pay from L. 100 to L.300 of rent; yet all of that
class are not comfortably lodged; but such as pay from L.50 to
L.100 are suitably accommodated. The houses of the crofters
and cottars are, in many cases, very indifferent. David Napier,
Esq. of Glenshellis, some years age, built a house and offices,
and planted and enclosed, to the extent of L.4000 at least.
   Considerable improvements have been made by Patrick For-
bes, Esq. of St Cathrine's, where there is a comfortable inn, and
many other conveniences for travellers.
   There is limestone in the parish, which is quarried, prepared,
and sold at the rate of Is. 2d. per boll.
   The only fishing systematically carried on is that of herring.
