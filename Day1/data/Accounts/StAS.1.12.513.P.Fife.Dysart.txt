   Ships.-A ship-carpenter employing about 6 men, settled
here in 1764.  His business gradually increased, till he found
employment for upwards of 30 men.  He has built here, 43
vessels measuring 5189 tons.  Of these, 15 were for Dysart;
for Greenork; the rest chiefly for the neighbouring ports.
In 1778, another carpenter bred under the former, began to
build, and has had very good encouragement.  He has built
31+ vessels measuring 3445 tons.  About 45 men are at pre-

back, 501 tons have been built annually, which at 5 L. the
ton, makes the annual value of this manufacture 2505 L.  The
crooked timber is imported from Hamburgh and Bremen, and
the oak plank from Dantzick.  The foreign timber, after
paying duty, is cheaper than what can be brought from any
place in Britain.  A considerable proportion, however, of
English oak is used, where it is most useful.  The separation
of the American Colonies from Britain, and the amendment
of the navigation act in 1786, have contributed much to the
rapid progress of ship-building in this country.  The em-

*The sales of the parish exceed the produce, because our manufacturers buy
cloth from other parishes and employ weavers there.  It may be observed, too,
that a number of the weavers in this parish are employed by the Kirkcaldy ma-
nufacturers.
+Only one of these vessels is yet known to be lost; 11 were for Dysart, the
rest Chiefly for the neighbouring ports.
