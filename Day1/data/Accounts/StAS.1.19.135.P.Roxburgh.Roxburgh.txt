tion, whereby they have seen this mansion surrounded.
These things, so expressive of the taste and dignity of the
former inhabitants of this place, are now quite effaced;
and there remains of the tower itself only two apartments
on the ground-floor, lighted by a few rays transmitted
through some slits in the wall, apparently designed for air,
or for shooting arrows from in different directions.  The
apartments are strongly arched above; the walls are up-
wards of six feet thick, and built with small stones, cement-
ed firm as the solid rock.  The roof is overgrown with
grass, interspersed by brush-wood, sprung, seemingly, from
feed blown thither from a neighbouring ash-tree.  These
bushes contribute much to the beautifully grotesque figure
of this ruin.  From this tower was carried to the late Lady
Chatto's (whose property it was) a strong iron gate, two
spears, a steel cap, and a coat of mail very entire.  The
spears were of such size that a rugg saw was made out of
each, and still to be seen here: the coat of mail was so
heavy, that a stout young man in this village, who tried it on
and essayed to walk, was not able to move with it.  This
ruin is called Merlin's Cave, in memory of an ancient in-
habitant of that name, they say.  It bears also the name of
Wallace's Tower; but whether it obtained that designation,
like some other places in Scotland, merely in honour of
such an illustrious champion of his country; or whether, as
blind Harry says, Wallace was actually in this place, and
built the tower at Roxburgh, the writer has not been able
fully to ascertain.  A young woman, about 70 or 80 years
ago, fell from the stair-head, where she was fitting spinning
one day, and soon after that the place was totally deserted.
From a superstitious aversion probably, that still prevails
