value of 1000 l.; and 6 looms weave of calicoes to the
amount of 500 l. yearly.  There is also lately established here
a manufacture of particular kinds of brown linens, never at-
tempted in this part of the country.  The number of looms
employed is 18.  The cloth is mostly used by coachmakers
and upholsterers; and the proprietor has a shop in London
for selling it.  One of the kinds is remarkable for its thin-

(1792) let at public roup for 293 l. exclusive of the guildry-

East causeway, and built in the year 1194.  There is yet ex-
tant an agreement between the abbot of Arbroath and the

largest share sell to the abbot, for which he was to receive an
