   The females exceed the males nearly 8 per cent., but the males
bear a much nearer proportion to the females in the rural districts
of the parish than in the villages. In the former, the females ex-
ceed the males only 6 per cent., in the latter 11 per cent. This
may be accounted for, by single women finding cheaper houses
and more employment in the villages than in the country.
