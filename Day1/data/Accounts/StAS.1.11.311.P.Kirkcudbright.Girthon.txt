siderably lessened the multures of the mill on his own estate,
to the no small encouragement of its agriculture.  The cotton

   Population.-As no regular register has been kept, the an-
cient state of the population cannot be ascertained precisely.
From Dr. Webster's report, however, we are certain, that it
has increased greatly within these 40 years, even excluding
the vast addition made to it, by the new village of Gatehouse.
The rest of the parish at present (1792), contains,

   Church and Poor.-The living, every thing included, is
about 120 L. yearly.  The manse was built a considerable time

small, and, from its situation, extremely inconvenient for the
bulk of the inhabitants.  The weekly collections, fines for
irregularities, &c. amount to about 25 l. a year.  Paupers, to
the number of 10, are assisted therewith.
