ure have, within these last 20 or 30 years, made a rapid
progress.  Much uncultivated ground has been broken up,
and is now become, through the united efforts of labour,
skill, and expense, capable of producing good crops of eve-
ry species of grain.  Fields which formerly lay open and
exposed, and were ploughed in a careless and irregular 
manuer, are now inclosed, straighted, and subdivided.
The sences, for most part, consist of ditch and thorn hedge,
often too slight, and too much neglected, to prove either
effectual or durable.  Some are constructed on a better
plan; a strong high earth sence, with a row or thorns on
each side, intermixed with trees of all forts.  Formerly
wheat crops were rare and scantv, because raised on soil ill
preparedd to produce it; but now great quantities of this
grain are sown on every large farm, on ground thorough-
ly fallowed, and manured with dung and lime.  One great
improvement in rural economy is the introduction of
thereshing mills, which the principal farmers are now every
where erecting, at a great expense, from L. 30 to L. 100,
and above.  As there is no convenient access to water require
7 or 8 hands to carry on the operation.  By this mode,
70 bolls of grain have been cleaned and prepared for the
field or the market in a few hours.  The number of ploughs
is reckoned to be about 25; but this is occasionally increa-
sed, especially in the spring, in order to carry on the ope-
rations of that important season, with vigour and expedi-
tion.  Every plough is drawn by 2 horses, without any
driver, as the man who guides the plough has the entire
command of them, by means of a long rein, which passes
from their heads to his hand, and rests on a hook inserted
in the stilts.  The plough in common use is the Scotch
