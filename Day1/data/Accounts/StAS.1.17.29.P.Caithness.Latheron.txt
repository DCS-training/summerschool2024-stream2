lected several of his friends, and by some means or other got
young William so much intoxicated, that he was carried to bed,
and Robert Gun put his sister to bed with him.-When Wil-
liam awakened next morning, he was surprised to find Gun's
lister in bed with him.  She told him, he might recollect that
the ceremonies of marriage past betwixt them the preceding
evening, and that she was now his lawful spouse.  He got up
in a passion, and declared that he was imposed upon, and that
he would hold no such bargain.
   Robert Gun flattered him, and said, that as he was now mar-
ried to his sister, he would make the match as agreeable to him
as possible, by putting him in possession of the estate of Lang-
well; and, in order to accomplish his promise, he, with a few
of his connections, concealed themselves near Hector More's
castle on the said rock, until early in the morning when the
draw-bridge was let down, they forced their way into the cas-
tle, and carried Hector More (who was then an old feeble man)
out of his castle, and left him in a cot house in the neighbour-
hood, where he remained for some little time, and afterwards
went to Sutherland, and passed the remainder of his days with
one of his relations, Sutherland of Rearchar.
   Robert Gun then returned in triumph to Braemore, and
conducted William Sutherland and his espoused wife to the
laid castle, and gave them also possession of the estate of Lang-
well.-William being very much dissatisfied with Robert Gun's
conduct, and not liking the company of his sister as a spouse,
went and complained of his grievances to the Earl of Caith-
ness, who promised him redress as soon as he returned from the
Orkneys, where he was going to quell a rebellion, along with
the Baron of Roslin, and wished that he, (William) being a very
stout man, would accompany him.  William consented to do
so; and returned to Berrydale to bid his friends farewell before
he would go on so dangerous an expedition.  Just as he was
parting with them at the burial ground on the Breas, on the
east side of the water of Berrydale, he told his friends that he
suspected he never would return from Orkney; he then laid
himself down on the heath near the said burial ground, and de-
sired his companions to fix two stones in the ground, the one at
his head, and the other at his feet, in order to shew to posterity
his uncommon stature; which stones remain there still, and the
