months, in this branch of bussiness, owing entirely to the
laudable exertions of the trustees for managing the fisheries 
in Scotland, in granting premiums to the owners of boats,
that extract the greatest quantity of oil from the liver of 
the barking shark.  The lucky adventurer in this fishing,
should he chance to harpoon a large one, may have 9 or 
10 barrels of liver, from which the return in clear oil is
about 8 barrels.  The ling and cod fisheries along the
coasts of the parish deserve the attention of the public,
should this branch of trade be carried on with diligence and
perseverance by monied people.  The banks for ling, cod,
skate, and turbot, are now discovered in the fullest extent,
to answer as well as the Shetland coast.  Colin Macdonald
of Boisdale, Esq; one of the heritors on the parish, is the
only person here who attempted to carry on this branch
of the fisheries with any degree of succes, excepting some
adventurers from Peterhead, who come to the coast here
to fish in March, and return in July generally pretty suc-
cesful.  The herring-fishing is the great object in the fish-
ing trade, to the inhabitants of the parish; notwithstand-
ing, this branch of the fisheries cannot be carried on to any
great degree, while the salts laws continue in their present
form.  The severe laws, with respect to the importation
of salt to these remote parts, is the greatest shackle that
the invention of man could find out, to put a stop to the
industry of the poor inhabitants of the parish.  It is there-
fore hoped, that our wise legislators will remedy this evil
in a short time, according to their accustomed goodness,
and prevent the misfortunes that follow of course to many
of the poor inhabitants of the Herbrides.

the parish has of late years considerably diminished.  Its
