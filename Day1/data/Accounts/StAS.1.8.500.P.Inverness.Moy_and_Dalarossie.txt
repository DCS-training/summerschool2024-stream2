clans from passing this place without his consent.  So sensible
were they of their dependence on him, upon this account,
that they agreed to pay him a certain tax, as often as he gave
them permission to take this road with their booty; which
tax is still known by the name of Stuic-chriacb, i. e. the steak

cultivated, it obtained the present name of Moy.  It came
into the possession of William, the 7th Laird of Mackintosh, in
