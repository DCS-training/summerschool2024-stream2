of the village, and others, with that view; and always have
a good crop of wheat in succession.  I reckon that above 200
bolls of this root are consumed by the inhabitants of this vil-
lage, in their diet, and in the feeding of swine, which they
kill for their own use.  Mr. Stevenson, then of Mongrenan,
in the shire of Air, who about 15 years ago resided at Marle-
field, to manage Mr Nisbet of Dirleton's affairs, brought from
that county a species of potatoes of an excellent quality, and
pleasant to eat, and very wholesome, which is now preferred
to every other kind for human use: it is not very large, but
very productive, and lies near the surface in a round form.
Without this valuable root, many families of industrious la-
bourers, even at the advanced price of their wages, a shilling
a day, from the spring time, and eightpence or tenpence
when the days shorten, must have been in pinched circum-
stances, when corn, butter and cheese sell so dear.

     Parish of Ayr.

     Some particulars contained in a second account of the Parish
     Ayr received from Dr. M'Gill in 1791, just after the first
     had been printed off, are here inserted.

   The Charter of the Burgh.-The Erection Charter of the
burgh of Ayr, was granted by William the Lyon; and is da-
ted at Lanark the 21st day of May, but no mention of the
year; an omission not unusual in those times. It must have
been between 1165 and 1214, probably about 1182.  How-
ever, the Charter contains a grant of all the lands now com-
prehended in the parish of Ayr.
