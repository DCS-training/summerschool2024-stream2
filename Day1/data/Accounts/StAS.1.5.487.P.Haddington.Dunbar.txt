profession of religion, and countenance it by their example.
This would have a leading influence on the great body of
the people.  It would be a cheap and easy antidote against
anarchy and disorder.  This seems to be the true secret of
government, the best bulwark of the state, as well as the surest
means to advance the happiness of any particular district.
Good morals are of more consequence to individuals, as
well as to a state, than great wealth; nor should the latter
be covetted, unless it can be obtained without injury to the
former.
