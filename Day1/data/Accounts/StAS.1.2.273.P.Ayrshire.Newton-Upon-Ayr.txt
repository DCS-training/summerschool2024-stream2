the extent of the trade, at this time, will be about L. 5000

   The only rope-work in the neighbourhood is on this side of
the river.  Some years ago, little was done in this line; but it is
now beginning to revive.  Ten hands are employed in manu-
facturing ropes.  The extent of the business is from L. 1500,
to L. 2000 per annum.-The hemp is imported from Peters-
burgh.

   Fisheries.-A salmon fishing is carried on at the mouth
of the river, and along the coast, as far as the parish extends,
to the northward.  This fishing, it is said, originally belonged
to the burgh of Newton; which is the more probable, as fish-
eries are  particularly mentioned in their charter: but it was
purchased from them, or otherwise got possession of, by the
Wallaces of Craigie, who retained it in their hands till within
these few years, when the estate was sold.  It was then pur-
chased by a society of writers or attornies, in the town of
Ayr, who paid L. 1100 sterling, for it; and now it rents at
L. 80 per annum.-Four boats are employed in this
fishing, and four men to each boat; their is 1 s per
day.
   White fish, haddocks, cod, and ling, with a few macka-
rel, slounders, and lobsters, are taken in this bay.  This
fishing is carried on by some of the natives of the town, but
chiefly by a set of fishers, who, within these 20 years, came
from the parish of Pitsligo, and the adjacent places in the
north country.  Most of them reside in this parish, and they
are an industrious set of people; but their profits are not con-
siderable.  Nine boats, and 4 men to each boat, are employed
in this fishery.
   Seal fishing is also followed by a few of the inhabitants.
