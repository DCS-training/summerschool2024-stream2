   Prices of Provision and Labour.-There are no regular markets
but for live cattle, which sell at various prices, accord-
ing to their quality.  Butter setches 10 s, per stone, (tron
weight, or 24 lb.) and cheese 4 s.  This being a plentiful year,
(an. 1790), the bull of oatmeal, consisting of 16 pecks, sells
for 13 s 4 d.  Small mutton for 5 s. and some for 6 s. each, com-
mon sowls, even when lean, are sold at 6 d.-A day's wages
to a labourer in husbandry, etc.  are from 6 d. to 8 d. exclusive
of victuals.  Carpenters and tailors usually make a charge for

from his master.  But it is only with gentleman far-

servants from 10 s. to 30 s. with victuals and shoes.  The com-

   Agriculture.-There is a great number of ploughs in the
perish.  They differ a little in shape from the low country
ploughs, but are drawn after the same manner by four horses.
No oxen are used.  The small-tenants use the plough, only in
weak ground, about the end of spring.  They have a notion,
which cannot easily be removed, but which they say is amply
