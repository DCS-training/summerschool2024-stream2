there is an universal desire to have the young educated. The
great desideratum. is the want of a judicious and active teacher.
There are two libraries in the parish, one of which is connected
with the Secession Church.
Poor.-No person is enrolled as a regular pensioner, so long as
there is any hope of his ever being able to provide for himself. In-
cidental distress is provided for by small loans with or without in-
terest, on the understanding that they are to be repaid again, if it
can be done; and frequently they are paid years after, principal and
interest. Nor is there any stated pension. The object in every
case is to meet the real exigency, and leave no a ology for begging.
The kirk-session have given sums from 6d. to 5s. 6d. per week,
according- to the necessity of the cases. Besides this, they pay
house rents, provide coals and articles of clothing, and shoes when
required. The number of pensioners varies from about 8 to 20.
To meet this expepse, there is a fund of L. 540 in the management
of the kirk-session, and L. 100 in that of the minister and two prin-
cipal heritors. There have been no assessments for the poor, but
the heritors and wealthier inhabitants have sometimes subscribed
to meet extraordinary cases. Nor does there appear any growing
indelicacy in the poor. The writer had occasion to examine very
narrowly into the state of the poor, on account of the approach of
cholera, and did not meet with a single instance of complaint, the
justness of which he had reason to suspect. In a population of 1571,
the whole claims did not exceed L. 8.
Fuel.-The fuel chiefly used is coal, and a colliery has been
lately commenced in the parish, but its practical effect is not yet.
known. There is an inexhaustible peat moss, which,in a dry year,
and with a cheaper mode of digging, might afford cheap fuel,
though greatly remedied by the draining of the lake.
