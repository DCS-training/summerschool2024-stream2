the parish, and consequently subject to storm.  The hogs have
plenty of coarse grass, and such attention paid to them as
ought to be paid to stranger, or what is called hetring
sheep.  But, considering the wetness of the harvest, the
stormy winter and spring, the hogs and stranger hogs, too,
brought to a high cold farm; from all this it might have been
expected, that most, if not all of this Cheviot breed, would
have died during the course of the winter.  But, what is asto-
nishing, upon the 27th March 1793, two days since, they were
all alive, and likely to do well, which is by no means the case
with the natives either upon that farm, or those of the neigh-
bourhood.  This has been a very sickly season, and, by all
accounts, every where upon the S. and W. of Scotland, the
fall of sheep has been considerable, through poverty and dis-
ease.

the shore of Dunnure in this county.  Wool in this parish
sells from 4 L. 10 s. to 6 L. the pack; from 7 s. 6 d to 10 s the
stone; and as it takes 10 fleeces for most part to the stone,
each fleece sold in wholesale, brings from 9 d. to 1 s. the fleece.
Ayrshire stone is 2+ lib. English.  This parish is supposed
to keep 25, 000 sheep.
   It must be observed in favour of the Cheviot breed, (but
by no means to exaggerate in favour even of them); those
of the Cheviot breed in this parish, though hogs (and every
storemaster knows that hog wool is by far the coarsest of the
wool) last season produced wool greatly superior in quality
and quantity to the wool of this parish.  The wool of the
natives, or, what may be called the short sheep of the farm
of Tarrasessock, where the hogs of the Cheviot breed, or long
sheep, pasture, and of the farms in the neighbourhood, sells at
