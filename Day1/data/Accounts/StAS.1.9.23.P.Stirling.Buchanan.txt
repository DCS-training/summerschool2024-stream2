   Manners and Morats.-The people are generally sober.
There are no villages in the parish, nor even what deserves
the name of a clachan at the church.  There are only 3
licensed public houses:  It is an advantage to the morals of
the people that there are so few.  The people are hospi-
table, and very charitably disposed towards the poor.  They
live in peace and harmony among themselves, and are very
ready to oblige and assist one another when need requires.
I cannot now recollect one law process between the inhabi-

rish; any difference among them used to be made up at the
barony court, and there have been very few differences
even before the barony court for many years past.  There
has no murder been committed time immemorial; no per-
sons have been committed to prison, or banished for any
crime, except one family who came to reside here, finding
it inconvenient to live any where else, and one individual
who came from the south, when pursued in his own coun-
try, took shelter here for a few days, and afterwards suffer-
ed at Edinburgh.

   Advantages.-One great convenience which this parish
has, is, that almost every farm has moss in the moors be-
longing to itself or contiguous to it; so that in moderately
dry summers the people may have plenty of good peats.
But after all, considering the time that is spent in cutting
the peats, setting and keeping them to the drought, and
carrying them home, which is a great part of the summer's
work, besides the danger of losing them all, or most of
them in rainy seasons, I leave it to my neighbours to judge
whether it would not be better to cast sewer peats, and
serve themselves partly in coals, especially since they have
now got a turnpike road to the coals.  One great advan-
