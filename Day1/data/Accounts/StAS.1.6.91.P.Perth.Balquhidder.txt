parish just now above 80 years of age, and there have been
different instances within the last 20 years of persons dying a-
bove 90 years old.

   Number of Horses, Cattle, Sheep, etc.-The number of
horses is about 170; of black cattle, about 800; and of sheep,
18,000.  The sheep are mostly of the strong black faced south
country breed.  The size and hardiness of the animal seem to
have been more attended to than the quality of the sleece, the
wool being long and coarse.  The average price of white wool
unwashed, for some years past, is 7 s. 3 d. per stone, tron
weight, and of the layed or tarry wool, 5 s. 3 d. per stone.  If
the quality of the wool could be improved without diminishing
the size of the animal, or making it less able to endure cold in
any period of its existence, it would greatly increase the value
of lands in this parish.  The only objection, which seems well-
founded, to an attempt towards meliorating the wool in this cli-
mate, arises from this circumstance, that all the fine-wooled
kinds of sheep bare or short in the pile when dropt as lambs.
The month of April and the beginning of May, which is the
lambing season, are in this climate cold and often rainy; whence
it is belived, that the rough or coarse wooled lambs alone
could stand the weather.  It will not be proper to have the
lambing season more advanced in summer, because neither the
lambs nor their dams will, in that case, be sufficiently strong and
hearty to bear the severity of the ensuing winter.  The car-
case of a wedder, when three years old, commonly weighs a-
bout 40 lb.  Ducth weight, and has from 4 lb. to 6 lb. of tal-
low, when fit for slaughter, towards the end of September.

   Population, etc.-According to the returns to Dr Webster,
the number of souls was 1592; at present it has decreased to
about 1300.  The annual average of baptisms for 6 years,
