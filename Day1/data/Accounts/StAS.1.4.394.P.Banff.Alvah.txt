the barony of Alvah.  About half a mile below the church,
the river is contracted by 2 steep and rugged precipices,
which are commonly denominated the Craigs of Alvah,
where it measures about 50 feet in depth.  The scenery,
which is naturally bold and picturesque has been greatly
embellished by its noble proprietor, the Earl Of Fife, by
thriving plantations, and a magnificent arch, which unites
both sides of the river , and forms easy communication
between the opposite parts of his Lordship's extensive park.
The fruitful haughs along the banks of the river are sub-

make dreadful depredations among the corns.  This in-
convenience is more especially felt in the neighbourhood of
the rocks of Alvah, which, during a flood, check the rapi-
dity of the stream,and make the water flow backward for
nearly 2 miles, and foread more than a quarter of a mile
over the adjacent fields.  As we recede from the river to-
ward the W. the country becomes more hilly and barren.
Of these eminences, one of the most conspicuous is the Hill
of Alvah, which rises from the bed of the river to a very
great height and serves as a common landmark to mari-
ners, on their approach to the coast.  The majestic appear-
ance of this mountain, which is somewhat increased by the
view of the church, manse, school, and a farm-stead on its
E. brow, is thus described by an indigenous poet.
   Erigit ad nubes hic fe mons Alvius ingens,
oftenatque Templa Deum furgunt in monte locata
Sublimi; furgit Pierdumque domus.
