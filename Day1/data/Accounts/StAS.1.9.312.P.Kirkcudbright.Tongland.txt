     NUMBER XXI.

     PARISH OF TONGLAND,

     (COUNTY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY,
     PRESBYTERY OF KIRCUDBRIGHT).

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM ROBB.

     Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, and Climate.

   IN ancient writings, the name of this parish is spelled
Tungland, and in modern, Tongueland and Tongland. I
know of no derivation from which it hath received this name.
Probably it may have got the appellation from its external
shape, resembling a human tongue, as it lies bounded by the
river Dee and the water of Tarst; but this derivation is gi-
ven as a probable conjecture only.  It is from N. to S. be-
tween 7 or 8 miles long, and in breadth from 3 to 4 miles
from E. to W.  In the south end of the parish it is only
about 2 miles, or 1 1/2 miles in breadth.  The surface, in the
south end of the parish, consists of a long ridge of high
ground, running from S. to N. with a gradual declivity to
the river Dee on the E. and the water of Tarff on the W.
