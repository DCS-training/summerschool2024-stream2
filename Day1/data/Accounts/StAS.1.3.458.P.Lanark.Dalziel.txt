nor, which has been spared, and kept in repair, by the pro-
prietor, solely on account of its antiquity.  It is a high Gothic 
building, with battlements and loop-holes on the top, and a 
foot path around within them; but its age is not known.
The great Roman highway, commonly called Watling Street, 
went along the summit of this parish from east to west, but
its course is now much defaced by modern improvements,
much of it being dug up, and its bottom ploughed, and for
some length, the modern turnpike road is laid upon the top
of it.  In one place, however, near the center of the parish,
it has been preserved entire, so as to point out the line to af-

there is a semicircular arch over the river, of good mason-
ry, and very uncommon construction, which has been suppo-
sed to be the work of the Romans.  By this bridge Wattling
Street seems to have entered the parish of Bothwell.  In the
hall of the old tower, of chateau above mentioned, an iron

flag horns, connected with iron work, and having sockets
for the candles of the same metal.  Where the gallows stood,

mark of feudal dignity, and the power annexed to it.  The
old church of Dalziel, lately deserted, is mentioned by Sir
James Dalrymple, in his Historical Church Collections, as a
