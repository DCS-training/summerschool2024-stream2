     Statistical Account

until the very end of April, or the beginning of May; and
throughout the summer it was the general opinion, that this
crop would be the latest ever known here, even later than
that of 1782.  In the end of August, however, and till the
middle of September, the weather became exceedingly mild
and warm, and of course, the filling and ripening of the
grain, was very much accelerated.  Soon after this, a very
great frost took place in the night, which blasted the tops
of the potatoes, and had such influence upon the stand-
ing corn, (which was not completely filled,) that it now
seemed necessary to cut it down with all convenient speed.
Before the 9th of October, nearly one half of the crop was
cut down.  From that period, to the 24th, it rained with
very little interruption.  This occasioned a very great spring-

On the 24th, the rain was succeeded by a violent storm of
wind, which it is said, has shaken in many places a conside-
rable part of the standing crop.  It will therefore be extreme-

of the country, to take care that no victual be sent abroad,
until they are sure there is a quantity at home, sufficient to
supply the demands and necessities of the inhabitants.  By
the former list of wood, it is evident, this parish is well
planted and ornamented with it.  The Earl of Kintore, it is
said, has at Inglismaldie, his family seat, the feat of the
Lord Halkertons, and in other parts of his estate in this pa-
rish, no less than 1500 acres, and that he draws by the sale
of his wood at Inglismaldie alone, upwards of L. 1000 per
annum.  Besides, the other heritors have planted around their
mansion houses, and on moors, a large quantity of wood,
which serves not only to beautify the country, but will in a
little time, both accommodate the inhabitants, and bring great
profit to themselves.  Mr Gillies of Balmakewan, the only
