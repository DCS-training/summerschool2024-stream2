glens and rocks.  Ashdow is particularly noted for the
haunts of owls, hawks, kaws, and wild cats.  The currie
of Balglass has long been remarked for an eagle that hat-

parish, as at Balglass and Corbeth, where in tall fir-trees

pies and bulfinches abound in the plantations at the hill
of Killearn, and some of the neighbouring banks.

   Fish.-Few places in Scotland afford better entertain-
ment for the angler than this parish, there being a great
number of rivulets and brooks abounding with trout, of
which Lochlomond affords in great plenty a perpetual sup-
