or dexterity can be expected on his part, and little profit on
the part of the employer.  The number of acres in the pa-
rish amount to about 12,000, (rented for little more than
2000 L. Sterling) of which above 7000 are at present in a
state of cultivation; 1800 are moss, (a considerable part of
it very deep) only 257 are planted; and the remainder is
uncultivated.  Though there is but a small proportion which
is not susceptible of cultivation yet, owing to the impro-
per modes of agriculture adopted, perhaps 3000 bolls of oat-
meal and bear are all that are exported annually; and the
whole produce not much above 7000 bolls.  Supposing the
attention of farmers and proprietors confined to the 7000
acres above-mentioned, and no more than 3500 to be under
a grain crop; from 15,000 to 20,000 bolls, at least, might
be reasonably expected under a judicious plan of manage-
ment.  A person interested in the welfare of the country
must be hurt, when he remarks the state of our corn farm-
ing; fields ploughed, from which scarcely twice the seed can
be expected, and species of grain sometimes growing, which
require two bolls to produce one of meal.  Nor will he be
less hurt, when he remarks the necessary consequences of
this management with regard to hay and pasture; extensive
ranges of country, where these ought to be found in great
abundance, yielding a scanty subsistence to a few sheep.
   The parish is divided among six heritors.  Nearly the half
belongs to one of them+.  And by granting no leases for
many years past, he has at present much in his power, with
regard to new-modelling his farms, and puting them upon a
proper footing.  With this views he has paid particular at-
tention to the different modes of farming, both in England
and in the South of Scotland.  But to introduce so complete
a change as either of these modes, all at once, (if at all prac-
