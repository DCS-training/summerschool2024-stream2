   Advantages and Disadvantages, etc.-There is a consi-
derable number of coal fields in this parish, which have, in
great measure, served the adjacent country for some cen-
turies past, and afford coal of various kinds, as hard, splent,
parret, and soft, known here by the name of cherry; and
of a mixed nature, in many places; all generally good of
their kinds: The strata are subject to many interruptions,
as is the case with most of the coal in the inland parts of
Fife, being often broken off, or thrown into different di-
rections, by hitches as they are called, which are of very
different thicknesses, composed variously of heterogeneous
materials; the coal strata themselves also differing in thick-
ness, quality, stricking, and declivity; seldom found to go
much deeper than 30 fathoms from the surface; whereas
the coal strata, close by the sea, both here, and in many o-
ther parts of our island, are said to run for miles, almost in
the same direction, and of the same dimensions.  The
coal fields in this parish that have been worked are Bal-
caries  coal.-Kilbrackmont coal, the property of Miss Scott
of Scotstarvet.-South Falfield coal, the property of Mr
Bethune of Blebo.  The above mentioned coals are not work-
ed at present, but, might afford more coal, were engines
erected, or mines driven deeper than formerly to carry off
the water.-Reres coal, the property of Mr Bayne of
Reres, worked by a mine, employs 6 men, a grieve, and
oversman.  The price of a cart load, 75 stone weight, is
2 s. 6 d.-Lathallan coal, the property of Major Lumsdaine
of Lathallan, worked by a mine, affords both hard and soft
coal, frequently of good quality; employs at present 8 col-
liers, 2 windlace-men, and a superintendent.  The price of
a cart load 75 stone weight, is 2 s. 2 d.-Largo-Ward coal,
the property of James Calderwood Durham, Esq; of Largo,
consists of really short strata, lying in transverse directions,
