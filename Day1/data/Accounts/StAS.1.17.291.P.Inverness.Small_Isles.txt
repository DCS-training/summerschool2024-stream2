ciety.  To obviate this grievance, a school, if practicable,
should be established in each island.  Another inconvenience
arises from the want of a post office, in a proper situation,
on the opposite continent.  The nearest post-town is Fort
William.  From Fort William to Ardnasouran is about 40
computed miles; from Ardnasouran, the nearest stage to
Eigg, is about 11 miles over water.  A post-office at Ard-
nasouran, and a packet between Arisaig and Uist, to call at
Eigg and Canna, would prove highly beneficial, in facilitat-
ing the intercourse between these islands and the continent.
   The salt laws are an object of great complaint in this pa-
rish, as well as in its neighbourhood.  The late alterations
in these laws have facilitated the getting, at a moderate rate,
salt for curing fish; but still the custom-house forms, to
which every purchaser of such salt must submit, may be con-
sidered as a real grievance.  If a person wishes to procure 2
or 3 barrels of such salt, to cure fish for the use of his fa-
mily, he must enter it in a custom-house, if it should be 50
miles distant; he must grant bond and security for it.  The
fish salted therewith, he must proceed with to a custom-
house, however distant; there he must unship and repack it,
and all this trouble and expence for a few barrels for his own
family use.  Such a grievance evidently needs a remedy.
There are other purposes, also, for which salt is indispensibly
necessary.  The lower class, who are the bulk of the people,
are often at a loss for this necessary article of life, from the
severity of the present salt laws.  They will have it on the
easiest terms possible, whatever be the means; and the dif-
ficulty of obtaining it in a fair, encourages an illicit trade.
   Another disadvantage, under which the parish lies, is its
great distance from public markets, both by land and water.
This circumstance renders it necessary to sell their cattle to
