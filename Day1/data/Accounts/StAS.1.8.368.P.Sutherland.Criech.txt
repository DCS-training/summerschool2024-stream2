stocked with sheep.  The number of sheep may amount to
upwards of 4000, and is increasing.  These sheep farms have
diminished the number of inhabitants, as well as the number
of black cattle and horses.  The belt of the wool sells at 12 s.
the stone, 21 lbs.  Scotch to the stone.  Most of the small
tenants have a few sheep of a small size, and badly woolled.
Their wedders, when fat, sell at 5 s. 6 d. and 6 s. 6 d. and sold
some years ago at 3 s. 4 d. and 4 s.  The sheep belonging to
the small tenants, it is thought, suffer from their bad manage-
ment.  They put them up in a small hut, just large enough
to contain their number, both summer and winter.  This, in
all probability, hurts them.

   Population.-The return to Dr, Webster, of the state of
the population, in 1755, was 1705.  The number of the inha-
bitants on the whole, is much the same that it was 20 or 30
years ago, being in some places less, and in others more nu-
merous than formerly.  In the year 1772-3, several emigrated
to America.  Some farms have been conjoined, and a consider-
able number of inhabitants have been removed out of grounds
turned into sheep walks.  By all these means, the number of
people have been considerably diminished in the western di-
vision of the parish; but in the eastern they are more numer-
ous than before.  The total number of catechisable persons,
or those above 7 years of age, in spring 1791, came to 1384;
so that adding the usual proportion of 1/4, the total population
may be stated at 1730 souls.  There are very few bachelors,
as the men, in general, marry young.  There are very few
married persons without children.  The medium of children
in each family is 5 or 6.  The number of small tenants, east-
ward from the river Shin, for 9 computed miles, is about 150,
besides people who have small crofts.
