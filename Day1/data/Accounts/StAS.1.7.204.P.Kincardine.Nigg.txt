The manner of their general payment is favourable to oeco-
nomy and exertion.  A man has commonly so many bolls of
meal, money to purchase boots, a fee, and a premium on the

is engaged, and the success of the fishing, he may gain from
5 L. to 15 L. in the season.

   White Fishers.-A greater number is employed in the white

villages of Cove, 24 men in 4 boats, besides 14 young and
aged in yauls, are occupied in this manner.  In the only
other village, of Torry, 36 men are in 6 boats, fishers, and
acting as pilots; and 9 in youth or age, go to Yea occasion-

6 s.  The round of fishing through the year, and different
manner of it, some particulars of which are applicable to the
east coast of Scotland, are these:
   In January the haddock has roe, is in good condition, and
ordinarily comes on the coast in squalls.  Towards March,
the smalll flat fish, salt fluke, and plaise, are in their prime
on the land bottom.  After May, the haddock recruited, and
the whiting good, are taken in moderate quantities, and a
few turbot.  From November, the cod, in best state, is
catched on the rocky ground.  This is the fishing with the
small line, and takes place at different distances, but common-

for a man to manage at sea and shore, contains 36 scores,
720 hooks, (in summer a few more), one yard distant from
each other other, on snoods of horse hair, value 15 s.-The
next fishing is with the dog line.  In August frequently the
sea-dog, that voracious fish, consuming all before it, comes to
4 and 3 leagues from shore, sometimes nearer, and is taken in
considerable quantities; 20 yielding, when good, one Scotch
