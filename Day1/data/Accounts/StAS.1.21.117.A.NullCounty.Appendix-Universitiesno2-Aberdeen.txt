And if by adopting this order they avoid the inconveniences
above mentioned, and make the sciences follow one another,
according to the natural connection of their subjects, and the
gradual openings of the human mind, may they not expect
the approbation of the public, and better fruits of their la-
bours in forming the minds of youth, so that they may be
possessed of knowledge more real in itself, and more useful
for the various purposes of human life?  The order of the
sciences here established, was pretty much observed by some
of the ancient stoics, particularly Panætius and Possidonius,
and Epictetus also insinuates that he considers it as the pro-

science laid down by Lord Verulam, and perfectly suits the
genius of his philosophy.  It appears to be that in which the
sciences will afford most light to one another, and in which
they will have the most happy influence on life.
   1. The first year therefore is employed in classical learning
under the professor of Greek, whose business it is, not only
to teach that elegant language in which the sciences were
first delivered, and which by retaining their original terms,
and from being used by those great masters, whose works are
still the acknowledged standards in them, must always be re-
garded as the foundation of learning, but to open the minds
of youth, by explaining antiquity, by acquainting them with
the lives and characters of the chief classic authors, and by
pointing out the uses and advantages of literature for the va-
rious purposes of human life.  As it is well known that the
Greek language is little taught at our grammar schools in this
country, and that an accurate knowlege of the elementary
parts is of the greatest importance, the first part of the session
is necessarily employed in teaching the grammar.  The stu-
dents then begin to read rome of the easier parts of the Tes-
tament, Lucian's Dialogues, AEsop's Fables, and towards the
