364              GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE

melted materials of a lower region have been forced to the sur-
face, and now form Traprain Law, Garleton-hills, North Berwick
Law, and all the other rocks of igneous origin so conspicuous in
the district, as well as - the various isles and rocks that stud its
shores. These rocks and hills differ both in structures, and, in
some degree, in the materials of which they are composed, and
are, consequently, distinguished by various names, such as por-
phyry, clinkstone, greenstone, basalt, &c. The designation
trap-rock is sufficiently descriptive of the whole family; hence
we here use it as a generic term. Trap is generally found in
the vicinity of limestone, which has led to the conjecture of the
latter being connected with the formation of the former. It
has  already  been stated as existing on the sea shore in the
eastern district of the county. The harbour of Dunbar is in part
formed of a rare and really interesting description of trap, which
from the colour and materials of which it is composed, leads to
the belief of its having been formed by the fusion of the red sand-
stone and limestone, that both abound in the neigbourhood. In-
deed, it is highly probable that the various descriptions of trap
are all merely the result of different degrees of heat, acting on
different materials met with in the interior, and, like other rocks
of igneous origin, have forced their way through the various
strata to the surface of the globe. The upbreaking, however,
of the regular strata of the section of the county at present
under consideration, by the trap, appearr to have produced a
greater diversity of soil of the present surface than could pos-
ibly have existed otherwise;-as, being lifted up and broken
to fragments in deep water, running with a heavy current, the
more clayey portion of the mass has, in some degree, floated
till carried to the sheltered side of the first rock in its course,
where it has been deposited, and now forms richer soil than that
composed of the rougher and harder materials hurled to compara-
tively lower and more exposed situations.  Hence the ridges or
tails of deep rich loam, forming the  eastern slopes of Traprain
Law, North Berwick Law, Garleton-hills at Barneymains, Dirle-
ton, Fentontower, Whitekirk-hills, and various other, localities.
The interesting fact, that the waters that then covered the country
ran with a strong current from nearly due west, is also strikingly
illustrated these deposits,-the ridges or slopes stretching eat
and west, and invariably resting on the east side of the trap-hills
and rocks; and further,rocks are common with a bold clear face
