	I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name and Boundaries.--The name of this parish is, by some,
considered of Gaelic origin, and derived from Tullich-cut-tir, sig-
nifying- the mount or hill at the back of the country, as descrip-
tive of the rising ground, called Kirk-hill, and Cunninghar, run.
ning across the vale, in a southeast direction, from the bottom of
the Ochils, near Tillicoultry House, to the Devon. This mount
or hill, viewed from the west, appears as the termination of the
valley, 'Which stretches along the foot of the hills, from Abbey-
Craig, near Stirling, to Dollar.
  The writer of the former Statistical Account considered the
name Tillicoultry as of Latin etymology , derived from Tellus
cults, referring to the introduction of Italian agriculture, or from
Tellus cultorum Dei, as indicating a place of Culdee, or of
Druidical worship,--the old church having stood on the northern
extremity, and the remains of a Druidical circle being still visible
on the south end of the Cunninghar.
   The figure of the whole parish, including the hills, is an oblong,
the two longest sides, which are on the east and west, measuring,
each, nearly 6 English miles, the south side 21/2 miles, and the
north side one mile. The low grounds taken alone form, also,
an oblong, the length of the sides, from east to west, being
more than 21/4 miles, and the breadth from south to north about 11/2
mile. It is bounded on the east, by Dollar; on the west, by Alva
and Clackmannan ; on' the south; by Clackmannan ; and on the
north, by Blackford.
   Topographical Appearances.--The surface of the parish is much
diversified,-two-thirds, or about 4000 Scotch acres, being in the
hills and glens, and the remaining 2000 forming a beautiful plain,
