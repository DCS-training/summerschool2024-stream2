Town-council, is the flourishing state of the school to be a-

who, with the advise of the Professors of the University,
settle the plan of reading, etc. in the different classes; and
along with them the ministers, and other persons of learn-

notice.  At these situations, the scholars go through their
different exercises, and the particular standing of each boy in
the class is marked down in a book; and at the end of each
season, when there is a public examination, before the Ma-
gistrates, the gentlemen of the college, and many of in-
habitants, prizes are distributed to the boys, not according
to the situation in which they may be accidentally found at
that time, but according to the average of their places at
the different examinations through the year; and this prac-

up the attention of both masters and scholars through the
whole course of the season.  Prizes are also given for good
attendance, in order to form habits of attention, which may
be useful to them in their after life, in whatever situation
they may be placed.

greatest quantity in any year during that period, was in
