                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Extent, &c.-The extreme length of the parish, from east to
west, is 4 miles, and breadth from north to south about 3 mile.
It contains 3120 Scots acres. It is bounded on the north, by
Ecclesmachen and Linlithgow; on the east, by Kirkliston; on
the south, bv Mid-Calder; and on the west, by Livingston and
Ecclesmachen.
   The highest part of the parish is probably. not 380 feet above
the level of the sea. Toward the north-west, however, where the
church and manse stand, it is so elevated as to have a commanding
view of the country to the east and southeast as far as Edinburgh
Arthur's Seat, and the Pentland hills, and even North Berwick
Law, as well as the Lammermoor hills, are seen in the distance.
   The parish anciently was named Strathbrock, which signifies
"the valley of brooks or badgers."

of Episcopacy, before the Revolution, a register of burials seems
to have been kept, which is still extant; but since that time,
this was for the most part neglected, till the, beginning of the
year 1840, when the regular registration of burials was com-

   Land-owners.-The Earl of Buchan is the principal land-owner
and patron of the parish. The valuation of his Lordship's pro-
