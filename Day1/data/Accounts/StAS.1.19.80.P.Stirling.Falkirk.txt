     Statistical Account

Upon certain parts of the estates which then belonged to his
Lordship, there is security given for the fulfilment of the
obligation.  Moreover, if his Lordship, or any of the suc-
cessors to his estates, should neglect or refuse to fill up any
vacancy in this hospital, it is provided by the foresaid act,
that, if this neglect or refusal be persisted in, after notice
shall have been given in due form to the person or persons
then possessing the Callander estates, then the minister of
Falkirk for the time being is authorised to present a proper
object of this charity to fill any vacancy which shall be in
the circumstances now described.  Mr Richard Callander,
then minister of Falkirk, and his successors in that office,
were, in the above specified deed, made, constituted and ap-
pointed patrons of this hospital, and were lawfully autho-
rised to nominate and admit proper poor persons to the
benefit thereof in all cases where the said Earl or his suc-
cessors should refuse or illegally delay to do their duty.
   There are several societies in this town and neighbour-
hood for the support of the members thereof, when they
are seized by sickness, infirmity or old age; but it is much
to be lamented, that institutions of this kind are not more
common and extensive.  When the labourer is in health,
he finds sufficient demands for his money, and too seldom
thinks of making a little retrenchment in his expences, in
order that he may prepare for the evil day.  The Legisla-
ture have turned their attention to those useful and impor-
tant societies, but much still remains to be done, in order
to insure their extension and success.

mediately about the town of Falkirk is let in small pieces,
