Magistrates of Musselburgh, to be shot for by the Royal Archers of
Scotland, is the object of an annual competition on the Links in the
month of August.  The victor receives from the town L. 1, 10s. and

medals attached to it from 1603 to the present time, with the
single exception of the perturbed 1745.  During these 236 years
it has only been thrice gained by the same individual, by Dobie of
Stonyhill, by Provost Drummond of Edinburgh, and lastly, by the

in whose keeping it remains for a year.

gentlemen of the town and vicinity.  A handsome silver cup is an-
