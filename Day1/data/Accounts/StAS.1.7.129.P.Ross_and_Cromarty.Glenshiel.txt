ordinate clans, the Macraes (or Mackraws) and Maclennans,
of which the Macraes are by far the most numerous.  These,
except the name only, are united by every tie of connection;
yet it is not unusual to see them under the influence of those
passions which mutual jealousy and clanish animosity inspire.
It is seldom, however, they fail to unite against any third
party, whom they believe or imagine to have a design of in-

any rents in Kintail; and all the attempts made to effect that
purpose by his Majesty's troops were defeated with disgrace,
and not without proving fatal to some of those who were rash

example of Donald Murchison, whose name, had his talents
been employed on a more conspicuous theatre, the page of
history would not blush to transmit with honour to poste-

either of remitting them to Seaforth, who then lived in
France, or of snatching an opportunity of conveying them
safe to his Lord in person.
   The inhabitants of this parish are a frugal people, plain,
open, and sincere; and, if surpassed in the virtue of industry
