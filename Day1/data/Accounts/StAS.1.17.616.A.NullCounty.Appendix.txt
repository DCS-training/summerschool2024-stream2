Sacred to sighs and deepest heart felt woe,
To seek the pleasing banks and purling rill
Where copsewood thickets cheer the wandering eye,
Where honeysuckle with the birch entwines.-
We enter now from hence the western glen

And gave her yielding to her Patie's arms.-

Odes, as if seated at one of the front windows of the house,
Look up to Pentland's tow'ring tops,' etc. and in an epistle
