nally called Strathgate, from one of its principal rivers.
They are bounded on the west by Kilmalcolml; on the south
by Kilbarchan; on the north and east by the parish of Er-
skine, which separates it from Clyde.  It is about 6 English
miles long; about 3 miles broad; and 5 miles distant from
Paisley, which is the presbytery seat.  The church of Hous-
toun is about 9 Scotts miles west of Glasgow, 6 from Port-
Glasgow, and 8 from Greenock.

   The only considerable river is Gryse, which separates it
from Kilbarchan on the south.  This river bath its fource in
the high moors and mountains that are situated between Kil-
malcolm and the Largs, on the coast of the Firth of Clyde.
It is composed of several streams, which unite near the man-

to the low country at Fullwood, where it meets the tide; af-
ter which it moves slowly, in a serpentine course, receiving
the river Black Cart at Moss Walkinshaw, and White Cart
at Inchinnan bridge, and thence into Clyde, a mile below
Renfrew.  In this river there is trout, most plenty towards
the high moors; in the lower part pike and perch; and, with
the first flood in June or July, salmon come up the river from
Clyde, and still more with floods in August, and continue in
the river till spawning time is over.

low country, which is a large plain, of a great extent, from the
mansion-house of Barochan and Houstoun, to Glasgow and
Hamilton; and in breadth, from Paisley, and the foot of
