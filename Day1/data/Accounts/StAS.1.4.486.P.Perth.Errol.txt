   For every 30 acres in the farm, one such plough is com-
monly judged necessary.  As the labour is severe, strong
horses are employed, which, for the most part, cost more
than L. 21 a-piece.  Four or 5 cows are kept on a pos-
session of 100 acres.

   Wages, Prices, etc.-An ordinary ploughman gets from
L. 7, 7 s. to L. 9, 9 s. a-year; if married, he pays L. 1 for
his house and garden, and L. 1, 10 s. for the maintenance
of a cow throughout the year.  There are many of both
description in the parish; and though the cottager is not 
so likely to change his residence, the unmarried person is as

employment is in the house, except in feed-time and har-

from the dwelling of the farmer; and for victuals, which
they prepare themselves, receive 2 peck of oat-meal a-
week, and a certain measure of milk for each diet.  When
labourers are hired by the day, they have 10 d. in winter,
and 1 s. in summer, for meat and wages.  Persons from the 
neighbouring boroughs are engaged for cutting down the
crop; the men get from L. 1, 3 s. to L. 1, 5 s. and the wo-
men from 15 s. to L. 1. besides provisions, which they ge-
nerally earn in 3 weeks.  A considerable expense, besides,
was annually incurred for a number of hands for threshing
out the grain, which service is chiefly done now by ma-
chines for the purpose.  Threshing-mills were introduced
into the parish about 3 years ago, are multiplying every
season, and considered a capital improvement in husbandry.
-The whole cost attending cultivation, exclusive of rent,
and also of lime, which is frequently demanded, are said
to be L. 2 an acre.  The price of provisions is much the
