almost all drained, and by the means of artificial grasses, the
farmers are become remarkable for their fine breed of cat-
tle, which are generally sold off at high prices, from 3 to 4
years old; and what are kept till they are full growth, are
not to be excelled by any of the Fife breed.  One farmer
sold his 3 year old black cattle last summer, for fattening,
at L. 9, 12 s. and the stock on hand this year is esteemed to
be much stronger and more valuable.  There is a gentle-
man who resides in the parish, who sold last season in Cupar
fair, the 2 best oxen, both for weight and beauty, that were
in it.
   It is impossible to say what are the real rents of the pa-
rish, as they are paid part in victual, part in money; and
hence rise and fall with the price of grain.  Besides there
are some 100 acres occupied by several of the proprietors
themselves, the rents of which cannot be ascertained.  The
valued rent is L. 3944:  9:  2 Scots; and the lands let as
high as any in the neighbourhood.

ster, the population was then 565.  The number of souls,

vers, 4 wrights, 2 blacksmiths, 2 masons, 7 tailors, 9 shoe-
makers, 1 miller, and 2 boatmen; about 20 Seceders; the
