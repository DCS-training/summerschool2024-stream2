church doors on Sabbath,- from mortcloths,- and proclama-
tion money,- and the interest of L. 50, at the rate of
4 1/2 per cent.  The collections at the church doors, with the
interest of the L. 50, etc. etc. amount to L. 17 per annum.-
The burden of supporting the poor, lies entirely upon the far-
mers, and the other poor inhabitants in the parish.  Though
there be nine heritors, yet they never inquire into the state of
the poor, nor contribute one farthing for their relief.

   Prices of Provisions and Labour.-The price of all kinds
of provision is double what it was 60 years ago.  A cow,
weighing 20 stone, might have been bought then, for L. 2: 15
sterling: a cow, of the same weight, will now cost L. 5.  A
fatted calf, which, at that time, brought 10 s 6 d. will now
bring L. 1: 1.  The price of mutton, lamb, etc. etc. is raised
in the same proportion.
   The wages of labourers in husbandry, and other work, are
generally 1 s 2 d. a day, except in the time of harvest; then
the men, when hired by the day, get 1 s 6 d. the women 1 s.
The wages of masons a day, are 1s 10d.- that of taylors,
1 s.
   The wages of a ploughman, have, within these 5 years, ri-
sen from L. 5: 10, to L. 7; and some of them get L. 8:- that
of a barnman, from L. 4, to L. 5: 5.  The wages of
female servants, are also raised from L. 2: 10, to L. 3: 5.

   Antiquities.-From the monuments of antiquity in the
village of Libberton, there is reason to believe, that it has been
a place of considerable importance in former times.  On the
south and east, it has been surrounded with a strong dyke, or
earthen mound, the foundation of which is still visible; and
which separates the arable, from the waste lands.- In the vil-
lage, there are likewise to be seen, the vestiges of three large
