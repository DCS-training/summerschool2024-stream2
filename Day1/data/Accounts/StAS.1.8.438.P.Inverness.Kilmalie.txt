   Dundbairdgball.-It stands upon the very summit of a
green hill, about 400 yards perpendicular in height.  The
traces of the building are still visible; and the part now re-
maining runs round the whole top of the hill, the compass of
which is 150 yards), not in any regular form, but following
exactly the verge of the sleep, so as to command the greatest
strength possible.  The figure is nearly oval.  By its situation
upon this elevated spot, it commands part of Mamore, and the
whole of Glenevis, and must have been originally intended for
2 place of defence.  This opinion seems to be confirmed by
the size of the work, and by its being in sight of the castle of
Inverlochy*.  Dundhairdghall appears to have been a fort of
great antiquity, and not inferior, in this respect, to Inverlochy
castle: indeed, of the two, it seems the more ancient.  It is
thought to have served as an outwork for strengthening that
place, when it was a royal residence.  Authentic information
is upon record, of the kings of Scotland having resided at In-
verlochy, in the time of Charles the Great of France:  and this
need not seem surprising, when we reflect that Scotland was
then, most probably, confined within very narrow bounds.
Granting the probability of the co-antiquity of these buildings,
Dundhairdghall is not less than 1,000 years old.  The part of
the wall that remains, is no more than from 2 to 4 feet high,
and is vitrified all round.  As this naturally renders stone
more friable, it has probably accelerated the downfall of the
building.  How the fire has been applied, can be only con-
