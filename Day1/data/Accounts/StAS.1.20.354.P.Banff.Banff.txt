   N.B.  The great increase in the quantity of coals imported
in the year 1796, was occasioned by the demands from
the country, where peat, the usual fuel, had been much
destroyed by the rains of that season.

   Salmon-fishing.-The Doveran is richly stored with sal-
mon and trout, and yields a very handsome revenue to the
principal proprietor, the Earl of Fife.

   In the year 1757, the late Lord Fife entered into con-
tract with a gentleman in Aberdeen, by which he sold the
fresh salmon of the Doveran, from 29th September to 15th
May, at three halfpence a pound.  The pound of salmon
now generally fells at sixpence, and early in the season at
nine-pence.
