        M`nufactures.-Almost the whole population residing in Dar-
vel and Newmilns, amounting to upwards of 3000, depend, direct-
ly or indirectly, for their subsistence upon hand-loom weaving.
With the exception of a small wool-mill, this is the only branch
of manufacture carried on in the parish. The following, table will
show the number of weavers and of those immediately connected
with weaving in these villages, and also the average amount of the
wages of each class:

  	Within the last two or three years, since the jacquard machine
has been brought into almost universal use in harness weaving,
upwards, of L.1300 have been expended in Newmilns alone upon
machines. The introduction of this machine has been of great
advantage, not only to the weaver but to his children, who former-
ly were employed as early as the age of eight to perform for the
weaver the mechanical labour now more efficiently accomplished
by the machine.
	The only other branch of manufacture carried on in this parish,
besides weaving, is wool-spinning. The wool-mill was established
in 1804. It belongs to a company of carpet manufactures in Kil-
marnock; employs 25 hand; and manufactures about 8000 yards
of woollen yarn per annum.

councillors, there is wisdom. In Newmilns, there are publicans,
