     of Torryburn.

Sterling.  The patron is the Rev. Dr. John Erskine of Car-
nock, one of the ministers of Edinburgh.-There is a good
parochial school here for the following branches of education:
Latin, English, writing, arithmetic, navigation and book-
keeping; besides a Sabbath evening school, which is support-
ed by subscription, and is at present in a flourishing condition,
and well attended.

   Poor.-The number of persons at present on the poor's
roll amounts to 50; 15 of these receive each from 3 d. to 6 d.
per week; other 15 are allowed 4 L. Scotch, to enable them to
defray their house rents; and the remaining 20 are those,
who, though in less indigent circumstances, stand in need of
some assistance, and receive from time to time, according as
the funds will allow.  The funds, from whence these payments
are made, arise, chiefly, from the weekly collections at the
church doors, and the profits of the mortcloth, which amount,
in all, to about 30 L. Sterling yearly.

   Shipping and Trade.-There are 13 vessels belonging to
this place, viz. 1 ship, 3 brigs, and 9 sloops; whose burdens,
put together, amount to upwards of 1000 tons, and give em-
ployment to about 70 seamen.  The larger vessels are engag-
ed in foreign trade.  The sloops are coasters; but some of them
occasionally go up the Baltic for wood and grain.  We have
2 passage boats, the larger of which was built by the mer-
chants of Dunfermline, principally for the purpose of tran-
sporting to Borrowstownness their manufactured diapers, which
are brought here in carts, and carried to London by the Bor-
rowstownness traders, and for bringing over the goods, which
come for them by the same conveyance:  And the other is
chiefly employed in importing commodities for the consumption
of the inhabitants.  There are no manufactures in the parish;
