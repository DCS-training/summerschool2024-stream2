     Statistical Account

   State of the Poor.-The average number of poor who now
receive alms is fifteen.  The annual sum expended for their
relief is about L. 32 Sterling, produced by the collections in
the church on Sundays, excepting the interest of a small sum
appropriated to them.  These fifteen persons are all main-
tained in their own houses, or boarded  in other families;
none of them are kept in hospitals or work-houses.  The
greatest number of them earn about two-thirds of their 
maintenance.  Those who are orphans under ten years
old, or who are very old and infirm, and without re-
lations to assist them, are boarded out at the rate of L. 4
Sterling per annum.  Besides the relief from the parish, the
poor receive frequent supplies of food and clothes from cha-
ritable and well disposed people.  They are however kept
from begging from door to door most effectually, by the as-
surance of their inevitably losing all parish relief if they per-
sist in the practice.  As the church session* is extremely at-
tentive to give them relief, according to their necessities, to
provide medical assistance for them when sick, to pay the
schoolmaster for teaching their children reading, writing,
and the common rules of arithmetic, their own interest in-
duces them to comply with the desire of the session, not to
beg.  Beggars, however, occasionally insest the parish, but
they do not belong to, nor reside in it.

   Price of Grain and Provisions.-The price of wheat, barley,
and oats, are generally regulated by the Liverpool and Gree-
nock markets, being just as much below the prices at these
places, as will pay freight, and afford a very moderate profit
to the corn merchants, who export the grain to one or other

parishes.
