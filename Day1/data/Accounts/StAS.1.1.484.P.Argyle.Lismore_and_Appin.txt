districts.  There are few hills in the Highlands where the
grass grows higher up toward the tops than in these moun-
tains.  The very summits of them all are rocky.  A very
small proportion of the land in Kingerloch and Appin is now
in tillage.

   Climate and Diseases.-The climate here, like all the coun-
tries exposed to the great Atlantic Ocean, is generally moist
and damp; the two last years have been more remarkably
moist than any in the memory of this generation.  A great
deal of rain falls here, but there are seldom such floods,
or heavy falls, as in the south, except a few thunder
showers in very warm summers.  There is seldom such
deep snow here, or of such long continuance, as in the
south; nor is the frost generally so intense, though arms of
the sea have been known to freeze over.  Few local or epi-
demical distempers prevail here.  The rheumatism, the ge-
neral complaint of all moist climates, is very common in these
parts:  It is rather matter of surprise that it is not more fre-
quent, considering the dampness of most of the common peo-
ple's houses, and how much the inhabitants are exposed to
rain and cold; especially as their ordinary mode of living is not
very luxurious.  Fevers and fluxes sometimes prevail among
the country people; and colds and coughs are very frequent
in severe winters and springs.  Agues are almost unknown
here.  Within these two or three years, the jaundice is be-
come very frequent in this and some neighbouring parishes.
Many of the inhabitants live to a great age.  During the re-
sidence of the present incumbent, many instances of longevity
have appeared.  Many live to the age of 84, and 85, some to
90, 94, and 96, and even to 100 years.  One man died last
year in Appin at the age of 105.  In the year 1744, the pre-
sent incumbent saw a woman in Appin who was allowed to
