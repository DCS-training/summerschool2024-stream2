   Population.-The population has advanced considerably
within these 40 years.  The returns to Dr Webster, about
1750, were 1594 inhabitants; at present they are 2309; 984
males, and 1325 females; making an increase, since that pe-
riod, of above 700.  About 1400 people reside in the village
of Bathgate, and 900 in the country part of the parish; in
the former are 327 married couples, and 113 unmarried per-
sons who keep house; and in the latter are 122 married
couples.  In the 20 years preceding January 1790, it appears
there were 1142 baptised, and 771 buried; and for 10 years
preceding January 1734, there were 415 baptized; making
an annual average of 41 1/2 births in the latter case, and, in the
former, of 57 1/10 births, and 381 11/20 deaths.  There are about
21 marriages every year, and each marriage may produce
about 5 children.  Of the 2300 inhabitants, 1989 attend the
Established Church; about 320 are Seceders; and 3 are  of
the Episcopal persuasion.  In the parish are 27 heritors, 10
of whom reside; 2 clergymen, (the established minister, and
the pastor of a Burgher congregation); 4 surgeons; 3 writers;
about 12 years ago there was only 1 writer, and he had less
business than any one of the three now has; 7 merchants or
shopkeepers; 2 students of divinity, and 1 of medicine; 255
mechanics, of whom 50 are apprentices; 55 farmers, in each
of whose families there are, at an average, 9 or 10 persons,
of whom 3 are generally hired servants.
