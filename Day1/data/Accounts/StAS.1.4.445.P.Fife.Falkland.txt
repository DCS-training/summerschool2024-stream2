     of Falkland.

   Burgh of Falkland.-Falkland was erected into a burgh
by King James II. in the year 1458.  The preamble to
the charter of erection states, as reasons of granting it, the
frequent residence of the Royal Family at the manor of
Falkland, and the damage and inconvenience sustained by
the many prelates, peers, barons, nobles, and others of their
subjects, who came to their country feat, for want of inn-
keepers and victuallers.  This charter was renewed by
King James VI. in the year 1595.  In this charter is men-
tioned the right of holding a weekly market, and 4 public
markets or fairs, yearly.  To these last have been added
other 2 markets, 1 in April, called the Lintseed-market,
and 1 in September, called the Harvest-market.  The 4 old

councillors, and may continue as long as that majority
pleases.  No old bailie is ever chosen a councillor, and can
come into council again only as bailie.  The revenue of
the burgh arises from custom at markets, landed property,
and a mill, and is, communibus annis, from L. 100 to
L. 110, exclusive of public burdens:  A sum which, in the
hands of patriotism and economy, might be turned to much
public good in so small a town.  It has not altogether been
misapplied.  There is one monument of public spirit in the
town, a plentiful supply of fine water.  It was brought in-
to it in the year 1781.  The expence amounted to near
L. 400.  Partiality for the place of his residence, and that
