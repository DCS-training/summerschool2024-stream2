in the centre of parish, about the abbacy-church.  The
loans of Fearn to the S. and the lands of Allan to the W.
are a deep clay, the N. and E. part is gravelish, the S. E.
and S. is light and sandy.  The face of the parish is near-
ly flat, with the exception of a few eminences, that are gene-
rally laboured, called by way of distinction, Hills.  About
three-fourths are arable, the rest partly green, and partly
covered with heath.-The air is generally dry and whole-
some, but the climate has varied much of late years, espe-
cially since 1782.  Fevers are the most general diseases a-
mong the common people; and, for the most part, at some

ced in years.

   Lakes, Fish, etc.-The loch of Eye is above 2 miles
long, and about half a mile broad.  No fish are to be seen
in it but eels; some of them have been got of a good size,
weighing 4, 5 and 6 pounds.  From this loch proceeds the
water to the mills of Fearn, and in its course forms 2 letter
lochs, in one of which there is moss and green plots, in
which ducks, teals and speikintares (which last are like sea-
gulls, but of a smaller size) hatch their young, and which
the swans and wild geese frequent a great part of the win-
ter and spring.-The Murray frith lies to the S. E. of this
parish.  The coast for about a mile is flat and sandy, on which
the fishing town of Balintore lies, and Hiltown, another
fishing town about half a mile more.  The fish caught are
chiefly haddocks, whitings, cod and red codlings, skate, cud-
dies, a few mackrel and slounders, dog-fish, lobsters, crabs, etc.
About 20 or 30 years ago, there were great quantities of
all the above kinds, and fold very cheap; 120 haddocks
for a peck of oats, and 160 for a peck of bear, or 6 d. and
other fish in proportion; but for 7 or 8 years past, fish has
