and, within the last ten years, three men died, two of whom
were above 90, and one above 80.  All the inhabitants, rich

   Loch-Duich and Shores.-Herrings pay annual visits to Loch-
Duich.  They generally make their appearance about the
middle of August, and sometimes sooner.  Their stay is often
short, particularly of late years; but, during some seasons,
they appear in such immense shoals, and continue so long,
that, in the course of a few weeks, many vessels fish full
cargoes.  It is observed, that, for the last six years, the her-
rings of this and the neighbouring lochs are much diminish-
ed in size, in so much that the nets with which they were
taken before that period, are now found to be by far too wide
for the purpose.
   In Loch-Duich are also found haddocks, cod, ling, skate,
cuddie, flounder, &c. with almost all the variety of fish (but
not in such quantities) that appear any where on the west
coast.
   The shell-fish on the shores of Loch-Duich are muscles,
wilks, cockle, limpets, spout fish, clam shells, &c. &c.
   Of the sea-weed growing on its shores, the proprietor al-
lows the several contiguous farms what is amply sufficient for
the purpose of manuring the land.  The overplus, which is
manufactured into kelp for his own use, does not, on an ave-
rage, exceed ten tons yearly.
