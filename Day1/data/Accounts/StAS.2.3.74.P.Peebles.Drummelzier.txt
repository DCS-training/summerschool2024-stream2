    Character of the People.--The people, on the whole, enjoy the
comforts of life in a reasonable degree, and are contented with
their situation and circumstances.  There is little poaching in game,
but a great deal in salmon.  Since the duties were so far lowered
that good spirits can be got at moderate prices, an end has been
put to smuggling, which at one time prevailed considerably ; nor
is there any more drunkenness in this parish now than formerly, in
consequence of the duties being lowered.  There are neither spirits
nor malt liquors sold in the parish.  The people are remarkably
sober; and their general sobriety has improved greatly of late years.
    During the last three years, there were 7 cases of illegitimate
birth ; but in 5 of these the parents married.

    Agriculture and Rural Economy.--Ther are 12 ploughs in the
    parish, which may have on an average 60 imperial acres each.
    The number of acres never cultivated is 13,815.  It is supposed
    there are about 36 acres in the low ground that could be profitably
    brought under cultivation.  The number of acres under natural
    wood is 11 ; under plantations, 400.
    Rate of Wages.--The rate of wages to farm-servants is from
L. 10 to L. 12 per annum, with victuals;  of women, L. 6.  The
wages of day-labourers are from 1s. 3d. to 1s. 6d. with victuals,
per day for men; for women, 8d.  In 1790 they were only the
half of that amount.  Wrights and masons get 2s. 6d. per day,
without victuals.
    Breeds of Live-Stock.--Ther are about 6600 in the pa-
rish, mostly of the black-faced breed, which, thought inferior to the
