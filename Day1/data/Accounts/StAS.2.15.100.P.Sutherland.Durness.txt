    Several of the larger burns or streams have salmon but, from
their distance and the difficulty of access, fishing in these would
not remunerate the expense.  *

    N. B.-It must be observed, that meal is imported to the pa-
rish to the average amount of 300 bolls annually.
    Kelp manufacture.-The only manufacture worthy of notice is
the kelp. It commences in June,- and in favourable seasons is fi-
nished early in July. It is cut every alternate year, spread out on
the shores, and when nearly dried is put up in heaps and burnt in

	caught in the net; but the stranger fish, on tasting the water, and entering fairly
