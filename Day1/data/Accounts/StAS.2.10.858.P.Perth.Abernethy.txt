 There is no district in which there is a better specimen of
 agricultural operations, conducted on the most improved principles
 of cropping and cultivation, than the parish of Abernethy, and par-
 ticularly that part of it which stretches along the rivers Earn
 and Tay.
    The valued rent of the parish is L.8884, 15s. 1d. Scots.
 The present average rental of the low land may be from L.2,
 10s. to L.3, 15s. per acre; of high land, from L. 1 to L. 1, 15s.
 per acre.  Some of the burgh acres are rented so high as L.5, 5s.
 per acre.
    The annual-rental of the fistings on Earn and Tay, belonging
 to the parish of Abernethy, does not, during the present year, ex-
 ceed L.250 Sterling ; but in some preceding years, they have
 brought a much higher rent.  It is supposed that the Carpow
 fishings have been greatly injured by the operations in progress
 for clearing and widening the channel of the Tay. The preced-
 ing statements in relation to agricultural statistics of the parish
 have been drawn from materials furnished by an intelligent farmer
 in the parish, Mr David Barclay, tenant of Balgonie.
