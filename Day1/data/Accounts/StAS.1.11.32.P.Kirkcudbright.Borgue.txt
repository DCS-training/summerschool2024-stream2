     Statistical Account

   Situation and Extent.-This parish is situated in the southern
extremity of the stewartry of Kirkcudbright.  It extends
farther south than any land in Scotland, one point in the shire
of Galloway excepted.  Its greatest length is 10 miles, and
its greatest breadth 7.  The figure of it is very irregular, and
the whole extent may be computed at 40 square miles.

   Sea Coast and Fish.-There are upwards of 15 miles of
sea coast, nearly half the circumference of the whole parish.
On this coast are the following bays:  Ross Bay, which af-
fords a safe and commodious harbour for ships; Bridgehouse
and Kirkandrews bays, where vessels of light burthen anchor
occasionally, in fine weather; and Knockbrix Bay, which is a
better haven than the two former, but much exposed to south
and westerly winds.  The other parts of the coast are all
rocky:  For the most part it is bold and elevated; and in
some places the cliffs rise 200 or 300 feet perpendicular; and
as this coast is very much exposed to the south and west
winds, the sea often rolls in upon it with prodigious force,
and forms a scene grand and awful beyond description.  The
spray formed by the dashing surge, is sometimes carried to
the distance of two miles.  It blasts the crops, and impairs
vegetation on the coast; but enriches and fertilizes the fields
which lie beyond it.-Samphire grows among the rocks in
great abundance.  Considerable quantities of other marine
plants are gathered for making kelp.  Cod, skate and slounder;
lobsters, oysters, and other kinds of shell fish, are also found;
but it has never been esteemed a good fishing coast.  Perhaps
no good fishers have ever made the experiment.

   Surface, Soil, etc.-The surface of the ground, it has been
observed, is remarkably unequal.  Although there are no
high hills, yet an acre of level ground is scarcely to be found
