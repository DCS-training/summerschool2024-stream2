     Name, Erection, and Extent.

   THE antient name is LOINN, derived from Luidhoin, which
signifies, in the Erse, or Gaelic, lodged or bedded bear,
because the lands contiguous to the church are of a good
quality, and yield excellent bear.  The modern or English
name is Latheron.-The parish was formerly divided into two
parishes at least, if not more.  In the title-deeds of Borg, a
part of the estate of Dunbeath, it is designed the town and
lands of Nether Borg, lying in the parish of Dunheath, and
shire of Inverness*.-The parish is 27 miles in length along
the sea cost, and from 10 to 15 miles in breadth in different
parts.

   Roads.-The principal, or only proper road from the
south to Caithness and Orkney, along the Ord of Caithness,

<FOOTNOTE>

*In the history of the wars in Scotland, there is mention
made, that in consequence of some dissensions between the
Earls of SUTHERLAND and CAITHNESS, the former sent 200
men into Caithness in February 1588, who over-ran the pari-
shes of Dunebeath and Latheron in a hostile manner.
