ces broom; in other places it is deeper and wet, and in
some places mossy.  In the higher part of the parish, as in
Morange, (a great part of which lies upon limestone,) it is
clayey and wet, and in some places mossy; but when the
season is neither over dry, nor ever rainy, it produces excel-
lent crops.  In Glenlivet, the lower part of it is loamy, or
mixed with clay; in the higher parts of it, the land is in 
some places mixed with clay, and in some places mossy; but
when the season is moderate, it yields excellent crops.  There
is in the head of Glenlivet, an excellent marl-pit, and the
farm of Tomalinan, beside whole land the marl pit is, lies
mostly on a rock of limestone.  Some who have large farms,
when a part of them is sown with barley, they sow the same
also with grass-seeds, which yield good crops of grass.  Oats,
barley, and pease, and, in some dry land, rye, are the grain
generally sown.  No wheat is sown, except in the mains or
manor of Ballendalloch, and there, for the most part, it
thrives well, because fallowed and well manured.  The
rent of the whole parish was stated before the Court of
Teinds in 1768, to be L. 13, 771: 1 Scots; but since
that time has considerably increased.-The parish, except
where it is washed by the river Spey, is surrounded with
bills, which are covered with heath, unless in some very
wet places, where some rough grass grows also.  The sides
of Spey, Aven, and Livet, abound, in many places, with
birch and alder.  There grow also oaks on the banks of
Spey and Aven, in some parts belonging to General 
Grant's estate.  The General has also some plantations of
firs, which are thriving well, and beautify the country.  As
the land of most farms, (except where it is clayey and wet,)
hath many small stones in it, the old Scotch plough is made
use of; but at Ballendalloch, and two or three more places,
the English plough is used.  Many have their ploughs
