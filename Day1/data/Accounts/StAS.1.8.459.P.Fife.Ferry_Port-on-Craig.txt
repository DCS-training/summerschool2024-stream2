duces potatoes, but the quality is generally not so good as in
light soils.  The strong loam stands on a whin rock; and, where
there is sufficiency of soil, it produces wheat, oats, beans, bar-
ley, grass and potatoes, in great perfection.  Flax is sometimes
sown on this soil, but seldom proves a good crop.  The light
loam is founded on sand, and produces barley, grass, oats, po-
tatoes, turnips and flax.  This soil produces the two last arti-
cles, in a moist season, very abundantly; but when long tracts
of dry weather take place, they prove but poor crops.  The
sand produces barley, grass, oats, rye, turnips and flax; all
which crops, in a favourable season, turn out far beyond what
a stranger to the nature of the soil could imagine.  The flax
in particular, turns out to be a very lucrative crop.  The
links produce a kind of pasture for cattle and sheep, and af-
ford accommodation for the grey rabbits, which, within these
few years, have turned out very valuable to the possessors, on
account of the extraordinary demand for their skins, which
sold at 8 s.  Sterling per dozen last year.

   Cultivation, Cattle, Exports and Imports, etc.-All the
tenants now use only ploughs drawn by two horses; one man
both holds the plough, and drives the horses with a pair of
long reins.  In driving their corn and dung, they use carts
drawn by two horses.  The farmers in the country employ
17 ploughs.  Cultivating the acres occupied by the feu-
ars in the Ferry, gives sufficient employment to 3 more, which
makes the number of ploughs used in the whole parish amount
to 20.-There are 61 working horses.  The greatness of their
number is owing to the villagers in the Ferry, keeping more
horses than would be sufticient for the cultivation of the land
they possess, were they always employed in agriculture; but
they frequently use them in driving coals for hire, and such
like work.-0nly 1 farmer keeps a flock; they are of the small
