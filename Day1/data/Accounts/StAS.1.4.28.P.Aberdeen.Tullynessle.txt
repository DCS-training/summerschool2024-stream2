     Statistical Account

   Rivers.-The parish is bounded on the south side for a
bove a mile by the river Don, which here is of considera-
ble breadth, but shallow, with a quick current.  All the
neighbouring streams abound with fine trout, and a good
many salmon are caught in the Don, though, owing to the
erection of cruives near its mouth, they are not so plenty
as would otherwise have been the cafe.  The parish is very
partially exposed to land floods.

   Minerals.-There is abundance of very good moorstone,
which dresses remarkably well for building; there are
quarries of blue moorstone or granite, 'similar to those about
Aberdeen; likewise there is a white moorstone of a very
fine grain, which can be hewn for most purposes to which
freestone is applied, but this kind is only found in single
blocks, in a very broken irregular quarry.  A grey mi-
caceous flag-stone of a good size is also be got in the
parish.

   Animals.-The common breed of black cattle in this
parish is a middling, or rather small sized, hardy kind,
weighing from 18 to 30 stone Amsterdam; they improve
very much when carried into richer pasture, and con-
sequently bring good prices from the drovers, who begin
to pick them up early in spring, and continue buying
through the summer.  Mr Leith of Whitehaugh, who
farms a great portion to his own estate, nearly one third of
the parish has for several years past been at uncommon
pains to improve the breed of cattle, and has now so far
attained his purpose, that most of the gentlemen and sub-
stantial farmers in the neighbourhood have thought it
worth while to possess themselves of a few of his breed,
which are of a pretty large size, very handsome, and re-
markably well horned.  There may be in the parish 390
