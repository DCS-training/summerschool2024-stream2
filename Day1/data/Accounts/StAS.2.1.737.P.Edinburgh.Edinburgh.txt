   Night Asylum.-In 1840 a night asylum, unconnected with
the House of Refuge, was opened for houseless wanderers, where
shelter for the night and food are afforded, besides medical ad-
vice and other temporary aid. This asylum still continues in ope-
ration; and both it and the asylum connected with the House
of Refuge have been the means of affording temporary relief to
thousands of indigent beings.
   Charitable Funds.-In 1731, Captain Horn left L. 3500, the in-
terest of which was to be annually distributed on Christmas day
to such day-labourers of Edinburgh and Liberton as by the in-
clemency of the weather may be set idle and reduced to want;
-no family to receive above L. 5 per annum or under L. 2, 10s.
In 1774, Mr Joseph Thomson of Mortonhall of Eildon left his
property as a perpetual fund to be laid out in purchasing oats to
be made into meal, which was to be distributed among poor house-
holders of Edinburgh at 10d. per peck when the usual price of
such article exceeded that sum. This charity is under the ma-
nagement of the Deputy-Keepers of the Signet.
   In 1639, Dr Robert Johnston of London left L. 30,000 for chari-
table purposes, the residue of which was paid into the treasury of
Trinity Hospital.
   In 1700, John Strachan, writer, Edinburgh, left his estate of
Craigerook in trust to the presbytery of Edinburgh, to be by them
bestowed in small sums to poor old people not under sixty-five
years of age, and to orphans not above twelve years. The income
of this property now exceeds L. 300 a-year.
   Charitable Societies.-There are a number of charitable Assc-
ciations in full activity to meet the various demands of the com-
