     NUMBER VII

     PARISH OF DOLPHINGTON.

     (COUNTRY OF PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEED-
     DALE, PRESBYTERY OF BIGGAR.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JOHN GORDON.

     Name, Extent, &c.

   I CAN form no conjecture from whence the name Dol-
phington is derived.  I only observe, that the princi-
pal heritor of the parish bears in his arms a Dolphin
fish; but from what circumstance he received this armo-
rial bearing, I have not heard.  This parish is situated 
in the E. corner of the upper ward of Clydesdale, extend-
ing about 3 English miles from E. to W., and about 2 1/4 from
S. to N., the great road from Edinburgh to Leadhills,
by Biggar, passing through it.
