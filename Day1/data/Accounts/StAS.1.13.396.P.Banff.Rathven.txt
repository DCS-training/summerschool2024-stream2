successfully raised for family purposes only.  The distinc-
tion between infield and outfield is scarcely known here.
Ground lately improved out of moors, or such like, which
will not bear the same rotation of crops as the farm, is
called outfield.  Land near the hills gives from 8 s. to 15 s.
and on the coast from 15 s. to L. 1, 10 s. an acre.  In ge-
neral the farms are small, and cottagers almost unknown.
Two tenants pay from L. 80 to L. 100; a few from L. 40
to L. 60; and all the rest from L. 10, or even lower, to
L. 40*.

   Manures.-Different tenants employ different manures.
Some are satisfied with what their cattle produce.  Those
on the coast are exceedingly attentive to procure sea-weed.
In summer they spread it on ley to the extent of 300 single
cart-loads an acre; of 160 after the crop is cut down,
and during winter; and of 100 in April and May, when it
is strongest.  This process is renewed every second year.
The weed is loosed from the rocks by a north-easterly storm,
and driven ashore in great quantities. In a small bay, called
the holl of Gollachie, 10,030 cart-loads have been accu-
mulated by the tide in the course of a week.  Sea Shells
purchased at any of the fisher-towns for 2 d. the cart-load,
are spread on the fields as a manure, and like sea-weed left
to the influence of the weather.  It would be a better plan
to burn them, as it is done at a small expense, and they

*Implements of Husbandry.-The ploughs are well adapted to the state
of the country; as the soil is light, they are of a slender but neat make.
A few of them are drawn by 2 horses, many by 4 and still more by 2 small
horses and 4 black cattle, either oxen or cows.  Carts are in universal use;
some of them are neatly and substantially made; but far the greater num-
ber are of so bad materials, so unartifficialy put together, and of so dimi-
nutive a size, as hardly to deserve the name.
