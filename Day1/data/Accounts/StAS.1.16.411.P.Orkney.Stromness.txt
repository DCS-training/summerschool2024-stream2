     of Sandwick and Stromness.

   Figure and Extent.-The parish of Sandwick is nearly
circular, and indented on the east by the loch of Stenness.
The scene which this parish presents to the eye is, that of
arable ground, interspersed with grass grounds of a lively
green, and here and there we meet with barren breaks,
stony and exhausted, which have been stripped of their soil,
either for fuel, or to enrich and manure there pleasant cul-
tivated spots.  The mosses having been exhausted, and
most of the hills stripped of their verdure, it may be pre-
sumed this parish has been long inhabited.
   The parish of Stromness is of an irregular figure.  On
the west side, fronting the Atlantic Ocean, is a chain of
hills.  It slopes towards the south; and all along the chan-
nel of Hoy Sound is a tract of fertile fields, agreeably in-
terspersed with grass and arable grounds.  From this part
of the parish, there is a view which has a good deal of the
sublime in it; the mountains of Hoy, and sometimes a cas-
cade of water from these mountains; to the westward of
which appear the hills of Strathnaver, and those as far as
Farouthead and Cape Wrath.  These, with the vast At-
lantic Ocean, form a scene picturesque and sublime, which
is heightened when the south-west wind blows strong,
which leads directly from the Atlantic Ocean.  It is this
wind which blows with the greatest violence here, and
makes the greatest sea.  The poet Virgil's description of
this wind might well apply to this place,

     -Creberque procellis,
     Africus, et vastos volvit, ad littora fluctus*.

   The fertile pleasant fields of this part of the parish, and
the sublime prospect, induced George Graham, the last
Bishop of Orkney, to build a house here, where he resided
