                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Situation and Extent.-THE parish is of a triangular form,
bounded by the parish of Walls on the south side; the parishes of
Orphir, Stennis, and Stromness upon the east and north sides; and
the Atlantic Ocean to the westward. The parish from north-west
to south-east is about 9 or 10 miles long, and in general is about
6 miles broad. It may be called a very hilly or mountainous dis-
trict. One of the hills in particular is so steep in many places as
to be almost inaccessible.
     The land or arable ground in this place is generally wet and
spongy; the soil light, and better calculated for grass than for grain.
     Graemsay is a very small island,-a mile and a half in length,
and a mile in breadth. Its population in 1831 amounted to 225.
                     II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
