     Diseases.-Notwithstanding the prevalence of rain and
moisture, the climate is found, by experience, to be remark-
ably healthy.  The ague is a disease altogether unknown
here, and even the rheumatism prevails much less than
might be expected from the wetness of the soil and cli-
mate.  The exemption from this last disease, in so great
a degree, is undoubtedly to be ascribed, in part, to the
general use of woollen-clothes, and to the abundance of
fuel; an article with which even the poorest families
are pretty well supplied.  The small-pox, indeed, com-
mits the same averages here as in other places where in-
oculation is not generally practiced.  The notions in the
minds of the country-people, lead the generality of them
to look upon inoculation as implying an impious distrust of
Divine Providence, and a vain attempt to alter its irrever-
sible decrees.  It is truly painful to think, that, in the
course of last summer, (1796), and in my immediate neigh-
bourhood, no less than six children, from one to twelve years
of age, have been cut off by this destructive diseases, all of
whom might probably have been preserved by means of
inoculation.  some of these children, too, were beautiful
and promising in an uncommon degree.  Three families,
however, wiser than their neighbours, inoculated their chil-
dren in time, and the issue was such as might well have en-
couraged others to follow their example.  The cases were
all remarkably mild and favourable.  It is to be hoped,
that a few more examples of this kind, contrasted with the
terrible, and often fatal, effects of the disease in the natural
way, will at length open the eyes of the people at large,
