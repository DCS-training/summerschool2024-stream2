augmentation, which is much needed, and it is hoped will be
granted; living being now more than doubled, even in this
corner, since the time this stipend was fixed.  A new manse
was built in 1780; and the church was built last Summer
and is now finished.

   Poor.-There are no funds for the poor, but the collections
made at church, which are small and pitiful indeed, amounting
only to  4 L. or 5 L. Sterling a year, and a very little for dues
of the mort-cloth.  The number of the poor on the roll, in
the east division of the parish, is 37, and in the west 23; in
all 50.  They can scarce get more than what is necessary to
buy shoes to them:  Very few, however, of this number go
about begging.  Most of them earn in harvest and otherwise,
as much as is necessary to support them; they commonly get,
from some friend or neighbour, a little land for potatoes,
which is of great service to them.  If a person is quite poor,
and unable to work at all, or diseased, the neighbours send in
what is nearly sufficient; or some friend goes about among the
tenants, and gets supplies for such an object.  On very ex-
traordinary emergencies, a collection is raised in the church.

   Scarcity in 1783-4.-This parish, like others in the neigh-
bourhood, was in great distress in Summer 1783 and 1784,
especially in 1783.  None however died for want.  On several
estates, the heritors procured victual to their tenants from
time to time; the victual, sent by government, was distribut-
ed among most of the families of the parish.  The poor were
singularly indebted to a gentleman in Glasgow, of uncommon
benevolence, who had lived in the parish when a boy, and
who sent money, and five bolls of white pease, which were
distributed among upwards of 80 persons, in proportion to
their necessity.  Some few removed with their families to the
