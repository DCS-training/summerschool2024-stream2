what it is at present. But it must be remembered, that the
extent of the parish is now diminished one fourth by the a-
bove mentioned annexation to Girvan and Dailly; and that
probably some males below 20 would, of themselves, be am-
bitious, or prompted by others, to enroll their names in so
popular a deed: Accordingly, we shall afterwards find rea-
son to conclude, that the inhabitants are now a fifth part
more numerous than they were a century and a half ago.
In 1720, at Mr Cupples' ordination, it appears from the re-
gister of the parish, that the population amounted nearly to
1168 souls, being exactly the same number as in Dr Webster's
account: Consequently the population of the parish, from
1720 to 1755, appears to have been almost stationary.  In the
year 1791, the inhabitants were numbered, and it was found,
that, during the last 40 years, they had increased 167.  The
result of this enumeration may be specified as follows:

   There are at present no remarkable instances of longevity.
The oldest man in the parish  not above 87.  But during
the last ten years, several have died considerably above 90.
