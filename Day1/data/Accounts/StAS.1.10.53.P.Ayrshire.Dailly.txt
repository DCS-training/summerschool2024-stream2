     of Dailly.

is a regular parochial school in the village, in which are
taught English, Latin, French, writing, arithmetic, and book-
keeping.  The number of scholars is usually from 40 to 60.
The salary of the school-master is 8 L. 6 s. 8 d. which, with
the school fees, a house rent free, and his salary and per-
quisites as clerk to the kirk-session, raises the annual income
of his office to nearly 30 L.

   Miscellaneous Observations-In antiquity, this parish has
nothing very rare or curious to boast of.  At a place called
Machry kill, there remain the vestiges of a small church or
chapel, probably dedicated to St Macarius.-In this parish,
and indeed throughout Carrick, the names of places, not evi-
dently modern, are all of Celtic origin; and by a skilfull ety-
mologist might all perhaps be traced to some local circum-
stance or peculiarity of situation.  A considerable number oc-
cur in composition with the words Bal, Drum, Knock, and
Kil; as Balibeg, (i.e. little town) Balcamy, Drumgirnan,
Drumochreen, Knockrocher, Knockgerran, Kilochan, Kilkerran,
Kilgramic.  There are many more which cannot be reduced
to any of these classes.

   In the customs and manners of the people, there is no-
thing very peculiar or characteristic.  The farmers are intel-
ligent and respectable; those in the lower ranks are indus-
trious, honest, and much less addicted than formerly to ha-
bitual intemperance.  They are in general attentive to the
education of their children; for there is scarcely an indivi-
dual in the parish who has not been taught to read and write
English.  They discover no peculiar bias to any particular
prosession.  Their inland situation protects them from cat-
ching the infection of a seafaring life; and the number of
those who have at any time enlisted in the army has been
very inconsiderable.
