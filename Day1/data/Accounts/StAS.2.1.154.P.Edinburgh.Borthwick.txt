of Charlie's well, from the name, I believe, of an old and favourite
servant of a former minister, who was very partial to it.
  Topographical Appearances.-The general aspect of the parish
is not that of a rich or very highly cultivated district-for there are
considerable tracts of barren moor in it-and the land in many
places lies high, and but a scanty covering of soil. Yet agricul-
ture is doing much to improve the appearance-of the most barren
portions of the district-the long and bleak moor which stretches
along the base of the Lammermuirs is beginning to be extensively
covered with cultivated fields and to wave with valuable crops-the
spongy sides of the streams are now under an active system of drain-
ing and made available for useful purposes-tbe low-lying swamps
are intersected by deep drains, are cleared of their encumbering
growth of wild wood, and taken into the general-tract of cultivated
land-numerous plantations are now covering the sides of the ris-
ing grounds with a promising growth for future years-and a spirit
of active and rapid improvement is visible over the greater part of
the locality. Still it is not unlikely that the traveller may form a
very inadequate and erroneous idea of the character of the district
from such appearances as are obvious to him while pursuing his
way along the high road by which the parish is traversed-for most
of its beauties lie along the banks of the streams, and in secluded
recesses which the eye of a passing observer cannot be expected to
descry-and both the picturesque banks of the Esk, and the less
prominent beauties of the valley of Borthwick itself, as well as of
several other similarly situated portions of the general territory, may
not even be suspected to exist by such an observer. This remark
applies, indeed, to a great portion of Scottish scenery, as well as
to that under our present consideration-but the search after such
unobtrusive portions of natural scenery is commonly well repaid to
those who take the trouble to look for them-and assuredly this
locality is as likely to afford the gratification that is sought for as
most, others to which the steps of the curious observer of nature
could be directed. We shall have occasion, however, to allude
more, particularly to the most remarkable of these spots while glan-
cing cursorily at the seats of the different proprietors.
  Geology.-The geology of this district affords no very great scope
for illustrative observations. The Lammermuir-hills, which bound
the parish on the south, are known to belong to the transition se-
ries, and they consist almost entirely of what has been called the
graywacke rock. The extensive moor which stretches along the
