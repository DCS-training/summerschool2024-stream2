of the teacher, religious impressions of a permanent character
cannot be expected to be stamped upon their minds; and hence,
when their attendance at school has terminated, they will have to
launch forth upon the troubled stream of active life with no fixed
principle to guide their course.
   It may be true that, even when the Scriptures were almost the
only school-book in use, the principles of many on the termination
of their school career had yet to be fixed; but admitting this assump-
tion to be well founded, still the circumstances in which the youth
of a former age were subsequently placed, were infinitely more fa-
vourable than are those furnished by the present state of society
for deepening and confirming the religious impressions of early
years.  It has been already stated, that the Scriptures, at the pe-
riod referred to, were not merely the only school-book, but formed
also, in conjunction with treatises of kindred character, at least to
the great body of the people, the chief subject of the study of
mature life.  On the magnitude and importance of the change
which, in respect of the circumstance last mentioned, society, as
now constituted, presents, it would be a mere waste of time to
offer many observations.  The fact is notorious, that the country
is deluged with publications, some of which are conceived in a
spirit of positive hostility to the principles of religion, and of which
others again, though not directly of an irreligious character, are
yet calculated, either to call off our attention from Divine things,
or insidiously to substitute views of our present condition and fu-
ture destinies, inconsistent with the views maintained on such sub-
jects in the volume of inspired truth.  Nor is it matter of less no-
toriety, that the publications in question, which are written, for
the most part, in a style peculiarly captivating, attract a large
share of public attention, and particularly from that class of the
community whose youth and inexperience render them in an es-
pecial degree susceptible of new impressions.-Another element
which, in modern times, is highly favourable to the growth of a
sensuous philosophy, and noxious, therefore, in a like degree, to the
best interests of religion, is to be found in the unceasing turmoil
and bustle necessarily attendant on the greatly extended range of
our commercial and manufacturing interests.  The many fluctua-
tions to which these interests are liable, the unremitting attention
required for the successful prosecution of them, and, though last,
not least, the congregating in one place of the myriads of human
beings to whom the give employment, have all a natural tendency
