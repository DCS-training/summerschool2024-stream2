     Statistical Account

one stone was left upon another of the old town of Lang-
ton.  The new village is named Gavintown, in honour of its
founder, and contains at present 159 persons.  The parish
is in figure triangular.  The mean length may be about 4 1/2
miles, the mean breadth 2 1/2.  It contains about 7200 Eng-
lish acres.  From the E. to the N. W. limit, the ascent
is gradual; from S. to N., the ascent is the same as far
as tile foot of the high grounds, known by the name of
Langton Edge.  On this edge, all the enclosed and culti-
vated part of tile parish is presented to the eye, as well
as the whole breadth of the Merse, and of Northumber-
land as far as Wooler.  And here the reflecting traveller,
after recollecting with regret, how often the flat below him
has been rendered, by direful war, a desolate and ensan-
guined plain, is pleased with the variety and abundance
with which peace and well directed industry, in modern
times, have clothed it.  The soil of the parish is various.
In the lower and cultivated part of it, the soil is generally
a loam of a reddish colour, well adapted to turnip hus-
bandry, and to the raising of oats and barley, and sown
grasses.  There are some fields of a very deep and rich
loam, which make good returns when sown with wheat.
All the fields are enclosed either with a stone fence, or
with a ditch or hawthorn hedge; and here some of the
hedges, with the hedge-row trees, are found to thrive as
well as in any part of the kingdom.  The higher part of
the parish, which consists of 5 sheep-farms, is covered with
fine green pasture, and is accounted as dry and found
sheep ground as is to be met with in the S. of Scotland.
The air, as we have no standing water near us, and are
placed in the upper part of the Merse, is reckoned as
pure and healthful as in any quarter of the county.
