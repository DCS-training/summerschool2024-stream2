do so, they were sure of feeling the effects of Miss Brownie's
wand next day. It is said that the Rev. Donald Macqueen, then
minister of this parish, went purposely to Trodda to check that
gross superstition. He might then have succeeded for a time in
doing so; but it is known that many believed in the Gruagach's ex-
istence, long after that Reverend gentleman's death.
   Besides the votaries of this ridiculous superstition, there are
others who confidently believe in the existence of a malignant
look, or evil eye, by which cattle and all kinds of property are said
to suffer injury. The glance of an evil eye is consequently very
much dreaded. No doubts are entertained that it deprives cows
of their milk, and milk of its nutritive qualities, so as to render it
unfit for the various preparations made from it. This supersti-
tion can certainly lay claim to great antiquity.
