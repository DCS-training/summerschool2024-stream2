     of Whitsom and Hilton.

   The annexation, which had been some years before de-
creed, took place in 1735, by the translation of Mr George
Home from Hilton to Whittingham in East Lothian.  Mr
Waugh's immediate predecessor in Whitsom was a Mr
Calder, brother of Cadwalleder Calder, Esq; author of a
very neat account of the Five Nations of Canada.  The
church was, in my remembrance, a miserable thatched build-

sites arising from his collecting the road-money.  However,
by the prudent choice of schoolmasters, some able teachers

scholars in penmanship, languages, mathematics, and the
