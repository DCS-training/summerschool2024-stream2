   Roads.-The roads are not in good repair.  This is to be
accounted for, from the nature of the soil, a deep wet clay,

<FOOTNOTE>

*The increase during that period has been occasioned chief-
ly by the houses, lately erected by JOHN HAMILTON, Esq; of
Pencaitland, for his colliers, whose numbers, including their fa-
milies, being 110, the increase, independent of that circumstance,
has been, during the above period, 37.

+The other inhabitants are employed in the lime-works,
and the different occupations of husbandry.
