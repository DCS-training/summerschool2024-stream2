mers could pay for them.  It would be better policy, as well
as more gratifying to every liberal mind, to permit this ne-
cessary and important class of people, to sit at very easy rents,
and free from every servitude to the farmers.  In this way
they would feel themselves comfortable, and be pleased with
their situation.  Farmers, and consequently landholders,
would reap essential advantages from the increase of their
numbers, and their thriving condition; and there would be
no necessity for their retiring to the great towns, and increas-
ing there, the mass of an unhealthy and debauched rabble.
The above 4 villages contain only 512 souls; but it is better
that this number should occupy 4 villages than one.  There
is a fallacy in the idea, that villages in the country are in a
more thriving state the more populous they become; for in
the same proportion as they contain above 200 souls, they
will be found to be declining, often in industry, and always
in morals.  Proprietors, therefore, in the country, who have
proper stations for villages, would consult utility as well as
ornament, by the erection of two smaller, instead of one large
village.  And while they give every reasonable encourage-

relative to feus, as the proprietors of them, when necessarily
removed, are too apt, rather than sell their property, to let
it to any beggar or vagabond.
