     Statistical Account

bleachfield on the S. side of the Clyde, in the immediate
vicinity of the village of Govan; and a cotton mill, which
gives employment to about 100 persons of different ages,
and is driven by a steam engine, has been lately built
about 2 miles nearer Glasgow, almost upon the western
boundary of the lands annexed quoad sacra to the parish
of Gorbals.

   Fish.-So full an enumeration of the different kinds
of fish found in the Clyde has appeared in the account of
Glasgow, that a detail of those found in it, as it passes
through this parish, would certainly be deemed superflu-
ous.  The salmon fishery is here a considerale object of
attention.  The annual rent it has lately brought to the
heritors, is 491.  Sterling.

   Minerals, &c.-In the ground on both sides of the ri-
ver, there is plenty of free stone of different qualities:
and of such clay as is used in making brick, there is, in
several places, great abundance.  The coal work, men-
tioned in the Statistical Account of Gorbals, is in the
land disjoined from Govan by the Presbytery.  Coal has
been wrought for many years, about a mile and an half
N. from the Ferry, and a new pit has lately been open-
ed at nearly the same distance from it in the opposite di-
rection.  But notwithsatnding this, a cart containing 12
cwt. costs in the village of govan, at least a shilling more
than in Glasgow*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Thirty years ago, the doctrine of mechanics in general was not so well
understood in this country as in later times, and the species of machinery used
in the raising of coal, had not reached that perfection to which it has now at-
tained:  yet a cart, containing somewhat less than 12 cwt., for which 5 s. must
now be paid, could then be purchased at so low a price as 1 s 6 d.  The value
