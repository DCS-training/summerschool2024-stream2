millan of Knap." * The family of Argyle retained possession of
Castle Swen from 1480 to 1644, when it was besieged and burnt
by Sir Alexander Macdonald, better known in the Highlands by
the name of Alastair MacCholla, who ravaged the whole district
of Knapdale with fire and sword.

   From this table it, appears that between 1755 and 1792, the
population had decreased 360. This decrease seems to have
been occasioned by the uniting of several small farms into one.
In the last Statistical Account, it is stated that " there are single
men who occupy some eight and some ten tenements, upon each
of which there is only one herd." The large increase of the po-
pulation, in 1801, is easily accounted for. The Crinan Canal,
which bounds the north-eastern extremity of the parish, was be-
gun in 1793 and completed in 1801. Strangers were attracted
from distant parts of the country in quest of employment, and
many of these settled in the parish, and were included in the cen-
us of 1801. One of the principal causes of the gradual decrease
from 1821 to 1841, has been emigration. A large number of
families emigrated to Upper Canada, while many others have
settled in Glasgow, Greenock, and Paisley.
