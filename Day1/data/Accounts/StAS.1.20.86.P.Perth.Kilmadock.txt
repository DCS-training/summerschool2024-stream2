   The skinning business was once carried on in Doune, but
it is now quite gone.
   In this town also was carried on, for some time, the ma-
nufacture of Highland purses.  That trade is also no more.
   The only remains of any of the ancient branches of trade
is the making of Highland pistols.  The reputation of
Doune for this manufacture, about the time of the German
war, was very great.
   This art was introduced to Doune about the year 1646,
by Thomas Caddell, who, having been instructed in his
craft at Muthill, a village in Strathearn in Perthshire, came
and settled in Doune.  This famous tradesman possessed a

a man of no education, and remote from every mean of in-

exertions brought his work to so high a degree of perfec-

equalled, those of his making, either for sureness, strength,
or beauty.  He taught the trade to his children, and seve-

son and grandson carried on the business successively with
great repute.  While the ancient dress of Caledonia, that
is, the philabeg, belted plaid, pistols, and dirk, was wore,
the pistols made in Doune excelled all others, and acquired
superior reputation over France, Germany, etc.  A pair of
pistols, superbly ornamented, were fabricated by a trades-
man taught in Doune, and, by the City of Glasgow, given
in compliment to Marquis de Bouille.  The above Mr Camp-
bell's grandson, who has now given over the business, made
pistols to the first nobility in Europe, as Prince Ferdinand
of Brunswick, the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, the
Duke of Cumberland, and others.  The trade is now car-
ried on by John Murdoch, also famous for his ingenuity in
the craft, and who has likewise furnished pistols to the first
