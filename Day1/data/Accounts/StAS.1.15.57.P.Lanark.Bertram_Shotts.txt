     of Shotts.

or supply upon extraordinary emergencies The number
upon the poor's roll of Shotts may be, communibus annis, from
20 to 28.  The allowance granted to individuals may be
each month from 2 s. to 6 s:  It often happens that there
are persons standing in need of temporary relief, who wish
not to be put upon the roll.  Their case at each meeting is
also considered, and a reasonable allowance granted.  The
sum, annually requisite for all the above mentioned purposes,
may be about 50 L. Sterling; of which, 40 L. or therea-
bout, is raised by assessment; the mort-cloths and kirk-dues
make up for the rest.  This plan, in a parish like Shotts,
where the Sectaries are so numerous, and the heritors of the
greatest valuation do not reside, seems to be the only equi-
table one which can be adopted.
   Population.-The enlargement of farms has produced the
same effects in Shotts that it has produced in other places.  A-
long the N. and E. sides of this parish, the property of
the Duke of Hamilton, and Sir John Inglis of Cramond, the
number of inhabitants is much diminished.  Of this, the
ruins of many cottages, and even of some farm steadings, afford
the most satisfactory proofs.  The parish, however, it would
appear, has of late been upon the increase:  Within these 12
years there have been built in it, and are now possessed, 35
cottages and 3 farm steadings.  For this the late increase of
travellers upon the great road, and the Omoa Iron work, suf-
ficiently account.  The total decrease within these 40 years
is stated, along with other particulars, in the following table:
