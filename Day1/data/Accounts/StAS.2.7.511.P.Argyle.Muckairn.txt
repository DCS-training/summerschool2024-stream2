to suffice itself, but also some every year to sell to the neighbour-
ing glens above it. But its chief increase is in cattle, with which
it is furnished plentifully of all sorts, cows, horses, sheep, and
goats, and bath this singular advantage, that every rown or farm
a part bath woods, moss for fuel, grass, corn, and barley land
commodiously mixed, so that every singular tenement bath all
conveniency within itself. The woods, whereof it bath as vet great
plenty, are oak, birch, and alder, are much impaired, especially
the oak, which is generally old stocks, so knotty and cross-grained,
that it is of little use but to shelter cattle in bad weather, and to
entertain some scores of roes that frequent them. In the lower
places of the country, are good store of hares, and everywhere more
than is wished of foxes, which can hardly be destroyed for woods
and so many rocky dens as they have to defend them. There is
also plenty of badgers or brocks in many places of this country;
particularly, there are two places in Sandy Hills so haunted by
them, that the ground is all undermined by them, and above forty
or fifty entries in each place, all having communication under
ground, so that a terrier or little dog trained to bunt them may
enter at one end of these bills and come out at another, and these
are impregnable strength to defend them; for in case they be hard
besieged either by terriers or by digging, they work so with their
feet, throwing the sand behind them, and so closing the passage,
that they elude the labour of their pursuers. But the surer way
of hunting them, is to watch them in the moonlight nights about
Michaelmas, for then they use to frequent fields on which the
folds of cattle used to lie through summer and harvest, whereby
the place so manured and fattened yields against that time of the
year a rank soft kind of grass, which the badgers, as is alleged,
gather and carry to their holes, and feed on in winter; but it is
more probable, that they feed on the woruns and roots of the grass
on the fields, and carrx some of the grass alongst to their holes,
with which they make warm couches whercon they sleep for the
most part all winter over.
   "In this country, there are few of these moorfowls called red cocks
and their hens, but great plenty of blackcocks and heath hens.
Of old there were here in the woods these fowls called capper-
coillies, which was a large fowl about the bigness of a turkey hen,
of a grayish mixt colour and round body, much of the shape of
the blackcock, but bigger, of good taste; such of them as fre-
quented the birch woods, tasted better than those that haunted the
