for no shorter a period than the space of five years.^^  At last,
Mr Hugh Scot was settled here, 17th March 1658.  He did
not continue long minister; for, on the re-establishment of
Episcopacy, he was removed from his church for non-con-
formity.  Mr James Adamson, minister of Carriden, was pre-
ferred to the living of Bedrule 7th September 1664, and con-
tinued minister here during the reigns of Charles and James,
and seems to have died about the time of the Revolution.
He was succeeded by Mr James Borland, in 1690, who was
the first minister settled here after presbytery became again
the established religion.  Mr Borland was succeeded by Mr
John Gilchrist in 1714, who, in 1748, was succeeded by Mr
George Dickson, to whom the present minister succeeded in
1788.  And, it is remarkable, of these above mentioned
nine incumbents, since the Reformation, except Mr David
Fowlis, who was translated to Oxnam, that they all died
ministers of Bedrule, or were removed from their charge,
not for any fault or irregularity of conduct, but for their
faithful adherence to the religion they professed; and, how-
ever obviously of different sentiments, fidelity and steadiness
in the cause they thought best, were equally remarkable in
the character of all.

<FOOTNOTE>

llIndeed, from a remarkable coincidence of circumstances, the records
and history of this country, in general, during that period, happen to be
very imperfect.  For, not to mention, the records and other interesting pa-
pers, which were carried to London by order of the Protector, having been
lost by the wreck of the vessel in which they were returning, by order of
Government, after the Restoration, on the Lothian coast, near Royston,
(Caroline park,) General Assemblies were interdicted during the Usurpation;
a Provincial Synod was, therefore, then the highest Ecclesiastical Court in this
country; and the whole records of the provincial synod of Merse and Tivout-
dale, preceding 1708, and, probably, containing an account of the cause of
that very long vacancy, were unfortunately destroyed by accidental fire in
the manse of Morebattle.
