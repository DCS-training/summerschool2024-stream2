     Situation, Extent, Soil, Agriculture, &c.

   THIS parish is situated about 12 miles S. from Edin-
burgh.  The great road leading to Cornhill and
Kelso, runs through it.  There are about 3900 acres in 
the parish.  Above 1100 of these are outfield.  This part
of the parish is little capable of improvement.  The soil
is a thin moss on the surface, with either a wet soft sand,
or clay bottom.  The pasture it produces is scanty and
bad, with little shelter for sheep.  The proprietors have
wisely turned their attention here to planting.  The planta-
tions seem to thrive well, and will beautify and shelter
the country.  Within these 5 years, about 50 acres have
been planted, in stripes and clumps, upon the estate of
Crichton.
   The othe part of the parish, towards the N., is well
adapted to tillage.  A great part of it is a deep rich soil,
