principally attended to, are oats and barley.  Wheat is too
much neglected, except by Mr Johnston, and even pease
and beans.  Crops of turnips are seldom to be met with'
and cabbages are never raised in our fields.  It is difficult
to ascertain the rent and produce of the land per acre.  The
farms are commonly let at a certain rent in cumulo, and the
farmers, not knowing the measure of their fields, seldom pay
attention to the produce of particular acres.  The result of
many enquiries is, that an acre of the best land, well manur-
ed, will produce from 7 to 10 bolls of oats, each boll weigh-
ing 14 or 15 stone, yielding about a boll of meal.  The oats
generally produce 14 pecks of meal, besides paying the mul-
ture, and all other mill-dues.  The multure is no less than the
13th peck.  An acre of the same land will yield from 7 to
11 bolls of barley, each weighing about 18 or 20 stone.  At
an average, however, an acre will not yield above 6 or 7 bolls,
whether of barley or oats.  Our dry-field barley is remar-
kably good, being very thin in the rind; and is reckoned, by
maltmen and distillers, equal to any railed in the Carse.  A
good deal of wheat has of late been sown in the farm of
Gutters, and an acre commonly produced from 8 to 10 bolls.
Forty bolls of potatoes have been raised on an acre, and one
farmer in particular had 18 bolls on the 4th of an acre.  The
writer of this account had access to see a remarkable crop of
potatoes, raised in Mr Barclay's garden, the produce being
no less than 105 pecks, or 6 bolls and 9 pecks, raised from
one peck planted.

   Farms, Rents, Pasture, Stock, etc.-The farms are in general
small, and there are only 5 tenants whose rent exceeds 50 L.
Sterling per annum.  A great part of the parish is inclosed,
and laid down in grass, and is let annually for summer graz-
