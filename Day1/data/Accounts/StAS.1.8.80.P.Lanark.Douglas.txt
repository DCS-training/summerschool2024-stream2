pease-meal were imported from Leith, and oat-meal from An-
nandale and Nithsdale; and the tenants were obliged to pur-
chase their seed corn for the ensuing year, at Leith, and in
Tweeddale, Nithsdale and Annandale.  The quantity sown
on the acre is about 6 Winchester bushels; and the average
produce of the whole farm, from 18 to 24.  The boll, or 6
bushels of oats, gives, communibus annis, 6 stones of meal;
but in calamitous seasons, it has been known to give only from
3 to 3 1/2, and of very bad quality.  The Blainsley or Tweed-
dale oats are most commonly sown here.  An early species,
called barley oats, has been introduced by some farmers; but
this grain is very liable to shed, or shake, before it is ripe,
especially in this country, where the winds blow very high.
Besides, these oats afford little straw, and that of a worse qua-
lity than the Tweeddale; and straw is the principal fodder for
horses and cattle here.  The greatest part of this parish seems
better adapted for grazing than tillage, and would probably
turn out to greater advantage that way; for servants wages
are greatly advanced*, and the return in corn being so very
small, little profit can arise from an arable farm.  The frosts
are seldom off, nor do the lands acquire a sufficient dryness
for sowing, before the 24th of March; and it is usually near
the end of September before the harvest be general.  The
corns are rarely got in, sooner than the end of October, or first
week of November.  There are 40 ploughs and 133 carts
in the parish.
