great part of Ayrshire, but as far as Cairnsmure, and other
hills in Galloway, and Benlomond, Jura, Arran, Kintyre,
etc.-The town of Machlin is situated on the south side of
this rising ground, which gradually declines towards the river
Ayr, on the south and south-west.  About 80 years ago, the
town had a charter, which is now lost, and with it, the right
of chusing magistrates.  This is much to be regretted, as that

Machlin town; and another white stone quarry called Deacon-

both belonging to Miss Scot.  Lime-stone also at Auchmillan,
belonging to Sir William Miller.  In, and on the confines of
Machlin parish, are various curious caves cut out of the solid
