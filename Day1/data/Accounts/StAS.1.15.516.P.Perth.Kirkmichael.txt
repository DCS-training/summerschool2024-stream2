   Schools.-In the parochial school are taught English, Latin,
writing, and arithmetic.  The schoolmaster's salary is 200
merks Scots.  There is one charity school in Glenshee, en-
dowed with a yearly salary by the Society in Scotland for pro-
ing Christian Knowledge.  At particular times of the year,
especially in winter, some persons voluntarily assume the of-
fice of schoolmasters in the remoter parts of the parish, and
teach reading of Engish and writing.

   Language.-The prevailing language in the parish is the
Gaelic.  A dialect of the ancient Scotch, also, is understood,
and currently spoken.  These two, by a barbarous intermix-
ture, mutually corrupt each other.  All the names of places
are Gaelic.

   Antiquities and Curiosities.-In the middle of a pretty exten-

or cairn, 90 yards in circumference, and about 25 feet in
height.  The stones of which it is composed are of various
sizes, but none of them, as far as they are visible, large; and
appear to have been thrown together without order.  They
are in a good measure covered with moss, and in some parts
overgrown with weeds.  This circumstance argues the great
antiquity of the cairn; for the circumjacent ground being
covered with heath, and of a firm mould, a long time must
have elapsed, before so much earth or dust could have been
collected by the wind, and ledged among the stones, as to
form soil for the nourishment of plants.  Round this cairn
are scattered, at different distances, a great number of smal-
ler cairns.  They are generally found in groups of eight or
ten together.  They are all covered more or less with moss
or heath.  About a furlong to the westward of the great
cairn are the vestiges, quite distinct, of two concentric circu-
