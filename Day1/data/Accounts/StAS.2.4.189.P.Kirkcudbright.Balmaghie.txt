	Poor and Parochial Funds.--There are at present 30 paupers
receiving stated aid from the poor's funds. The highest sum paid
to a pauper, in ordinary circumstances, is L.5 annually, and the
lowest L.1. There are two insane paupers supported from
these funds at an annual charge of L.26. The sum annually
expended upon the poor amounts to about L.80, and is raised
partly by the collections in the church, and partly by donations
from the heritors individually. Amongst many there is an evident
reluctance to apply, in the first instance, for stated relief; but it
is equally observable, that the feeling disappears when they have
been in receipt of such aid for a time.
	Inns and Akhouses.--There are five small inns and two ale-
houses in the parish. All of these, with one exception, are con-
ducted with much propriety, and, it is believed, without ill conse-
quences to the morals of the people.
	Fuel.--In various parts of the parhsh peat is found in great
abundance, and constitutes the fuel principally used by the inha-
bitants. Coal is imported from the shores of Cumberland, and
landed at Kirkcudbright, Tongland, and Palnackie in the parish of
Buittle; but as the nearest of these places is nine miles distant,
the charge for overland carriage constitutes a heavy per centage
upon the cost of the article. At the less busy seasons, many of
the farmers are in the practice of sending for coals to Dalmelling-
ton in Ayrshire. The distance is not less than thirty-five miles;
but, considering the small charge at the pit-mouth, the trifling ex-
penses incurred on the road, and that the journeys are so timed
as not materially to interfere with the work of the farm, this is
found to be a rather economical method of procuring a supply of
fuel.
