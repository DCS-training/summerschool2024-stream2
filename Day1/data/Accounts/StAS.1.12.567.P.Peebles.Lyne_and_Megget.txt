carried.  It is certainly the interest of every member of the
community, that the communication from one place to an-
other be rendered as easy as possible:  but gentlemen of land-
ed property appear to be more concerned in this than others:
For, of their tenants are obliged, on account of the steepness
and roughness of the road, to employ 4 carts in carrying
what would otherwise have been an easy load for 3, it is
evident that the expense must ultimately fall upon the pro-
prietor.  Though the management of the money arising from
turnpikes is, with great propriety, committed to the trustees
of the different counties, yet it may be doubted if the plan-
ning and original direction of the roads be safest in the same
hands.  Wherever men are interested, there they are not
competent judges; this is perhaps the reason, that, in making
roads, the publick interest is sometimes sacrificed to the pre-
tended interest of individuals.  Were the gentlemen of the
different counties to agree, that the planning of the roads in
their own county should be left to a deputation of gentlemen
from a neighbouring one, the objection would, in a great
measure, be obiated; for, in that case, private or political
interest would have small influence.  With regard to the great
roads through the kingdom, would it not be of advantage to
the nation, were commissioners appointed by parliament, un-
der proper restrictions, to superintend this branch of publick
police; and if 2 or 3 engineers were added to the commis-
sion, we might reasonably expect, that beauty and utility
would soon be united, and their joint labours tend, in a con-
siderable degree, to promote the publick good.
