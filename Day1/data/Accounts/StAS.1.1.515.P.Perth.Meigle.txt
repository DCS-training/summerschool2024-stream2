   In this parish considerable improvements have been made,
but much remains to be effected.  The greater part of it is 
inclosed and subdivided with hedges and hedge-rows; but
two of the proprietors being minors, their tenants have not 
sufficient encouragement to proceed with vigour.  The soil,
in general, is a fine black mold on a bottom of mortar, and
yields excellent crops or wheat, barley, oats, turnip, flax, and
grass.  About eight years ago, the author of this memoir
procured a few garins of oats of an excellent quality, but un-
known in this country.  During the first three years he sow-
ed them in his garden, and afterwards in his glebe.  The in-
crease has been considerable; for last year, viz. A. D. 1790,
there were upwards of 500 bolls of them in the neighbour-
hood.  They are 17 stones English per boll, are several weeks
earlier than the common oats, and are not liable to be shaken
by the wind.  There are 9 farms in this parish, from L. 50 to
L. 200; about 20 from L. 20 to 50; the rest are inconside-
rable.

   The rent of the infield, i.e. of four-fifths of the whole, is
15-30 s. per acre.  The hire of a day labourer is 10 d. or
1 s.; of a man servant L. 7: 9: 0; of a female L 3.  The
price of beef, mutton, and pork, 3 1/2 d. and 4 d.; of a turkey
3s. 6d.; of a goose 2 s. 6 d; of a hen 10 d. a dozen eggs
3d.; butter 8 d. a pound of 22 ounces; cheese 5 s. a stone,
same weight.  The prices of wheat, oats, barley, and meal,
are generally regulated by the market at Dundee.  Utensils
of husbandry are expensive.  A coup is L. 8: 10: 0; a plough
L. 1: 10: 0, and L. 2: 2: 2; a harrow 8 s.; harness for two
horses L. 2: 16: 0.
