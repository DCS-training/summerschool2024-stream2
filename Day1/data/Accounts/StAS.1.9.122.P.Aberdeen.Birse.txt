the south side of the Grampians.  They are hospitable on
all occasions; but though remarkably so to strangers, they
are not fond of them settling among them.  They show no
particular fondness for, nor, if their country need it, any par-
ticular aversion to the military or seafaring life; some of them
have betaken themselves to both, and 3 Chelsea pensioners
reside in the parish.  The fashionable vices of the town are
unknown among them.  Some years ago, 1 low-spirited

winter, and wet seasons, these are most uncomfortable.  We
have certainly excellent materials for roads; and if even the
rate of 1 s. 6 d. fixed by law, were levied, and properly laid
out, (as is done in a neighbouring parish, certainly our
roads could soon be rendered comfortable.  Turnpikes are
