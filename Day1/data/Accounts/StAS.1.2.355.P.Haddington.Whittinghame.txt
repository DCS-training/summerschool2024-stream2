parish, it will not be improper to state, in a general manner,
how it is now conducted.  Several corn-farms are just now
either laid, or laying down in grass, for the purpose of fee-
ding black cattle and sheep.  This circumstance, indeed, is
merely accidental; and, it is probable that this farms, after
lying a few years in grass, will be again converted into titlage.
But, at present, the grazing business is carried on with great
spirit, and to a considerable extent.
   The number of black cattle, fed on grass, during the sum-
mer season, is about 200, besides 40 to 50 fed on turnips in
winter.-  Of ewes, lambs, and wedders, fed on grass in summer,
there are from 80 to 100 scores.  Two-thirds of these may
be supposed to be ewes and lambs, and one-third wedders.
     No sheep, at present, are fed on turnips in winter.
   Here it may be observed, that during these few years past,
the grazing and feeding business, in this parish, has remarka-
bly increased.  It is computed, that, about 14 years ago, the
number of black cattle, fed on grass in a season, did not ex-
ceed 60 or 70; and of sheep, about 40 scores, and these
were almost entirely ewes and lambs.
   It is supposed, that the number of black cattle, bred at pre-
sent in the parish, may be from 40 to 50.
   The raising of turnips, between Whittingham water and
the hills, is entirely in its infancy, and capable of very great
improvement.  It is expected, that, in a few years, much
greater quantities will be raised; and, consequently, there
will be a proportionable increase, both in feeding and breed-
ing*.
