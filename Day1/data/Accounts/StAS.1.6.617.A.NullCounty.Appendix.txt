     of Ediburgh, etc.

   In 1763-Young ladies (even by themselves) might have
walked through the streets of the City in perfect security at
any hour.  No person would have interrupted, or spoken to
them.
   In 1783-The mistresses of boarding schools found it ne-
cessary to advertise, that their young ladies were not permitted
to go abroad without proper attendants.
   In 1791-Boys, from bad example at home, and worse a-
broad, had become forward and insolent.  They early frequented
taverns, and were soon initiated in folly and vice, without any
religious principle to restrain them.  It has been an error of
twenty years, to precipitate the education of boys, and make
them too soon men.
   In 1763-The weekly Concert of music began at six o'clock.
   In 1783-The Concert began at seven o'clock; but it was
not in general so much attended as such an elegant entertain-
ment should have been, and which was given at the sole ex-
pence of the subscribers.
   In 1791-2, The fashion changed, and the Concert became
the most crouded place of amusement.
   The barbarous custom of saving the ladies, (as it was called),
after St. Cecilia's Concert, by gentlemen drinking immo-
derately to save a favourite lady, as his toast, has been for some
years given up.-Indeed they got no thanks for their absurdity.
   In 1763-The question respecting the morality of stage-
plays was much agitated.  A clergyman, a few years before,
had been brought before the General Assembly of the Church,
and suspended from his office, for having written a tragedy,
unquestionably one of the most chaste and interesting in the
English language*.  By those who attended the Theatre, even
