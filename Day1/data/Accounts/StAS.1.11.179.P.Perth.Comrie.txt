     of Comrie.

consists of the strath, flat ground, from Comrie to Locherne-
head, and of 4 glens; 2 of them large, Glenairtney and Glen-
lednaig; and two small, Finniglen and Glentearkin.  The
figure of the parish is irregular.

   Situation, soil, and Surface.-It is situated in the county of
Perth, and is the western boundary of Stratherne.  The soil,
in general, in the low grounds, is light and gravelly, and full
of small stones.  In some farms, especially in the glens, it is
deeper and rather swampy.  On the sides of the glens, and of
the strath, to the E. end of Locherne, and of the loch itself,
there is a continued chain of hills.  These hills, which com-
prehend by far the greatest part of the parish, consist mostly
of sheep farms.  In the higher parts of,the glens, there is
little encouragement to plow and low, as the crops are al-
ways late, and often destroyed by the frost and rains.

   Climate and Diseases.-The air, in general, is very pure and
healthy; but the climate in the strath differs considerably
from that in the hilly part of the parish.  In the glens, there
is a great deal of rain: In the strath, which is pretty broad
near the village, they seldom think they have too much.  Be-
fore the goats were banished from the country this parish was
much resorted to by invalids, from Edinburgh and Glasgow,
for the recovery of their health.  Most of the inhabitants live
to a good old age.  There are among them, at present, 8 men
and 9 women between 80 and 90 years old, and a great num-
ber between 70 and 80.  Colds and rheumatisms are the most
common complaints.  A few have of late been attacked by bilious
disorders, especially in summer and harvest.  Colics too have
sometimes proved fatal, particularly (it is remarked) to those
