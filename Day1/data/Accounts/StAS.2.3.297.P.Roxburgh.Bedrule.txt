the year 1834, a year fatal to thousands of emigrants from this
country, who fell victims to cholera soon after their landing in
Canada, the fever of emigration has in a great measure sub-
sided.
  The inhabitants of this parish and of the neighbouring parishes
have several striking peculiarities of dialect.  For instance, instead
of me and he, they pronounce these words as if written  m/e4i and
h/ei; instead of tree, they say tr/e4i; and three, thr/e4i, which is pre-
cisely the German drei, by the substitution of th instead of d.
They pronounce the Scotch twa, with a peculiar drawl, making it
a dissyllable, as if written tw/e4ah; and brae they make br/e4ah.  All
these sounds are rather pleasant to the ear; but their pronuncia-
tion of the initial h in some words is harsh, and cacophonous in no
ordinary degree.  Thus the proper name Hope, signifying a par-
ticular kind of glen, they pronounce as if written whupp; and
hole, as if whull; horn as if whurn.  These peculiarities, as far as
the author has been able to ascertain, are confined to the higher
districts of Roxburghshire.  It might afford a curious subject of
inquiry how this peculiarity of sounding the initial h originated,
and how far it might serve to throw light on the Aeolic Digam-
ma, a subject which has so long divided and perplexed scholars
"et adhuc sub judice lis est."  These peculiarities of dialect are,
of course, generally confined to the lower ranks of the people,--al-
though, such is the effect of habit and imitation, you hear some-
times people, from whose education and rank you might augur
differently, utter the same harsh and barbarous sounds.
