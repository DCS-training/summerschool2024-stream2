It is collected in a reservoir at some distance from the pier, and
then passes through a filter, after which it is received into the
pipes, and distributed. The road leading from the pier to Inver-
leith Row is one of the finest in Scotland, both in regard to its
breadth and construction. A branch of railway from the pier is in-
tended to join the terminus of the Edinburgh and Glasgow line under
the North Bridge, and will be opened in the month of August
next. His Grace is supposed to have spent on this very spirited
undertaking, including the splendid hotel and houses for the officers,
&c. &c. a sum of L. 140, 000. The pier is under the able manage-
ment of Sir William Bain.
