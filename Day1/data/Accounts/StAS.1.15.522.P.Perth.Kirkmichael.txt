situation in which the peasantry are thus retained, has a
strong tendency to repress the exertions of industry; to ex-
tinguish the ardour of patriotism, that attachment to his na-
tive soil, which glows spontaneously with such warmth in
the breast of a Highlander; to quench the spirit of freedom
and independence, and
   "Freeze the genial current of the soul."
Is it that the landlords are apprehensive of deriving no bene-
fit to themselves from granting leases; or of their tenants
not having money or skill, or industry, for making improve-
ments?  Or, is it, that the tenants are unwilling to bind
themselves for a number of years, to modes of cultivation,
with which they are little acquainted?  Or is it, that men,
on whom wealth and power have conferred one kind of su-
periority, find, in the exercise of that superiority, and in re-
ceiving that servile dependence of their inferiors, a gratifica-
tion which they cannot be persuaded to relinquish?
