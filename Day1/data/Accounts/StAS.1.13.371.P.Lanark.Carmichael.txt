   Minerals.-There is one coal-mine situated in the S. W.
side of this parish, adjoining to that of Douglas, which be-
longs to the Earl of Hyndford.  Three several seams, from
three to six feet in height, and of a very good quality, are
at present working.  They decline S. W. about one in
four.  Till of late no coal had been wrought in this parish
by machinery.  Levels had been at different periods com-
municated from the low grounds, and so much of the coal
wrought as these drained.  The whole coal to be got by
such levels being wrought out, a steam engine is now used
for draining it more to the dip.  The coals are carried to
the bank by the colliers and their children, or others em-
ployed for the purpose.  Coals are sold upon the hill at
6 d. the load, of 12 pecks Linlithgow measure, which is near
about 3 d. the cwt.  They have been raised about a third with-
in the last 20 years, and were for some time last winter with
difficulty to be got.  There is, as in the case of all other la-
bourers, a great rise in the wages of colliers; a man, with
two children of 10 and 12 year of age, it is said, can earn
from 3 s. to 4 s. a-day.  It is believed that in this, and the
neighbouring parish of Douglas, there is a certainty of
coal to answer the highest demand that can be expected
for some centuries.  The quantity of coal sold from this
parish at present is said to be 70,000 loads and upwards 
annually.  The demand has increased greatly since the 
cotton manufactures were established at Lanark and Dou-
glas, and is still increasing.  There is one limework also
in the S. W. side of the parish, belonging to the Earl of
Hyndford, which is wrough by an open quarry, and drain-
ed by a level.  There is nothing remarkable in the stone;
