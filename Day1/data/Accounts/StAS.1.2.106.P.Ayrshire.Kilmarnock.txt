timber, where land can be let for 18 s or 20 s per acre.  But though
this may be the case with respect to the planting of large fields
of arable ground, yet hedge-rows, or belts of planting, are
well worth their room, from the shelter that they afford; and
there are in every farm, even in the best cultivated grounds, ma-
ny spots which the plow cannot reach, which, with a little at-
tention and expense, might be planted, to the great ornament
of the country, and to the great advantage of all concerned.
Wherever such spots are to be found, they ought to be inclo-
sed and planted by the proprietors, and the care of them in-
trusted to the tenant, who should be allowed to deduct yearly
from his rent, (if the trees are properly taken care of) a cer-

the rent paid for the farm.  Besides, he ought to be permit-
ted to make all such farm utensils as he needed, from these
spots; only taking care to replace them when cut down, if
they were not of a sort that sprouted again from the root.-
This would prove a very important acquisition to the tenant;
and, besides the benefit the ground would derive from the ad-
ditional shelter, the proprietor would in time be more than
compensated, by the timber that would remain on his estate af-
ter all the demands of the farmer had been answered.
   There is another method by which a very important addi-
tion might be made to the quantity of timber in the country.
Every farm-house ought to have a large plot of ground, con-
taining from one to two acres adjacent to it, for stacking the
corn in winter, for grass to any favourite milk cow, for a
kitchen garden, &c.  It should be laid out on no uniform plan,
but the figure of it varied every where, so as to suit the situa-
tion of the house, and the form of the fields around it.  If any
rivulet runs near the house, it should be carried up through
it, for the conveniency of washing and bleaching, and of wa-
tering the plot.  But, what is of still more importance, the
