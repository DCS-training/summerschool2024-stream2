   No register of burials had then been kept in the parish, so that
the difference between the births and the burials could not be as-
certained.  No accurate calculation, moreover, can be instituted
from the above table, as the children's names had not been uni-
formly enrolled.  The return of the population made to Dr Web-
ster in 1755 was only 2029.  Not very long before Mr Ure's
time, the upper part of the parish was greatly depopulated by the
accumulation of small farms into large ones.  In 1793, he states
that the parish was inhabited by 587 families, which contained
2359 persons, of whom 1065 were males; 1294 females; and
488 children under six years of age.  He likewise mentions that
the village of Kilbride consisted of 71 dwelling-houses, and was
inhabited by 167 families, containing 524 individuals.
   Since 1793, a few additional limeworks, and the agricultural im-
provements, have probably contributed, in some small measure, to
produce the increase of population which has taken place.  In
1821, there were about 890 inhabitants in the village or town of
Kilbride; 225 in the village of Maxwellton; about 30, who might
be regarded as a village population, in Nerston; about 50 of the
same class in Jackton; about 128 in the village of Busby, which
belongs to East Kilbride, quoad civilia; about 22 of a village po-
pulation in Kittochside; about 40 of the same in Crosshill or
Aldhouse quarter; and about 2100 of a rural population in
the whole parish, quoad civilia.
   In 1836, there appear to have been about 960 persons resident
in the village or town of Kilbride; there were 267 in Maxwell-
ton; and about 2380 in the rest of the parish, quoad sacra, that
is, exclusive of the Busby quarter.  The proportion between the vil-
lage and the country part of the population cannot have been much
altered since 1821, except as regards Kilbride and Maxwelltn.
