     NUMBER XXXVII.

     PARISH OF BANCHORY TARNAN.

     (County of Kincardine.-Presbytery of Kincardine o'
     Niel.-Synod of Aberdeen.)

     By the Reverend Mr FRANCIS DOUNEY.

     Name.
   THE last part of the name is that of a saint; hence one
of two annual fairs, held near by, is called St Tar-
nan's market, and a small fountain not far distant is called
St Tarnan's well.
   Banchor is said to signify fair or goodly choir; and, it is
conjectured, that in some remote period, there has been a
kind of seminary of the clergy established at this place, by
one of the above name.

   Extent.-It is of very unequal surface; few level fields of
great extent; and the whole interspersed with much muir
ground covered with heath, and many small, and some pret-
ty large hills. It contains 15,040 Scots acres, being 19,125
English.  The rent is about 1800 l. Sterling, besides 200 l.
annually, arising from the sale of birch and fir wood.  The
valued rent is 3450 l. Scots.
