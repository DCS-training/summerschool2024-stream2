makes the ploughs so very numerous, is, that commonly they
only plough from the beginning of March to the 20th June.
-At least one third of the kelp is made of wrack, cast by
storms upon the shores.
   The black cattle and horses are mostly in a starving con-
dition.  The latter, when their pasture is very bare in win-
ter and spring, tear up the ground with their feet to come at

ed, or the services that may be exacted, there is no country
