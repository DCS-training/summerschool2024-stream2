more springs of the same kind in different places of the pa-
rish.

   Woods.-There are two oak woods in the parish; one a-
long the western bank of the Ericht, which is now cutting.
This cutting sold at 320 l.  There is a smaller wood of the
same kind on the property of Ardblair, and there are several
birch woods in the head of the parish.  There are only a
few ash, elm, and plane trees*.  There are at least 900
acres planted partly with larch, and partly with firs.  It is to
be regretted, that similar plantations have not been made, on
the moorish grounds in the northern district.  There are
vast tracts of muir, which turn to little account in their pre-
sent state.  Shelter is much needed where they abound.
The mosses, the greatest sources of fuel, are nearly exhaust-
ed, and every year become more difficult of access.  Coal is
at a very considerable distance, and there is no water car-
riage.

   Population.-No dependence can be had on the parish re-
gister, for the number or proportion of births and burials.
This may in some measure be accounted for, from the great
influx of emigrants from other parishes, especially from the
Highlands, who settle here as servants, etc.  By comparing
the report made to Dr Webster, however, with the result of
an accurate enumeration made in October, November, and
December 1793, we are enabled to state the exact increase,
which is but small in proportion to the influx of strangers
within these 40 years.

<FOOTNOTE>

*In the year 1774, the muir of Blair-Gowrie, then a com-
mon of 500 acres, was divided, and most of it, in 1775, was
planted with Scotch firs; the rest of it has been gradually plan-
ted since that time, partly with larch, and partly with Scotch
firs.
