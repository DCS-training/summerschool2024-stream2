exertions were made in the making and repairing of high
roads in this neighbourhood.  Thus, from seeble begin-
nings, works of public utility became general through the
county.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people in general are
economical, but for their circumstances have rather too ex-
pensive a taste.-Property in land has been more fixed in
this parish than in most others.  The estate of Ormistoun
has only once changed its proprietor for several hundred
years.  In the year 1747, the late Earl of Hopetoun being
then proprietor of three farms in the parish, purchased the
whole, so the present Earl is now sole heritor and pa-
pron of the parish.  The roads in general are in bad repair,
and some bridges are wanted.  The badness of our roads,
however, is not owing to carelessness, but to the deepness
of the soil, and the scarcity of proper materials for repair-
ing them.  I despair of seeing them much altered for the
better, till a proper turnpike-law is obtained.-In the scan-
ty years of 1782 and 1783, the poor no doubt suffered;
but from the humanity of the Earl of Hopetoun, not so
much ass might have been apprehended.-Near the village of
Ormistoun, on the fourth, is a bridge of two arches, built
many years ago over the Tyne, a very small river indeed
at this place, but by additions which it receives in its course
to the German Ocean, which it enters about 20 miles N.
E. from Ormistoun, near the feat of the Earl of Hading-
ton, it is greatly increased.  Its source is bout 8 miles
southward in the moor of Middleton, a high ground, and
connected with hills of considerable extent and height.-
The year 1735 to 1736 was marked by a considerable
land-flood.  In the month of June, when the days was still,
and clear sun-shine, not a drop of rain having fallen either
on that day or the preceding, a sea of water came rolling
