   Wheel Carriages.-No waggons belong to this town.
The Carlisle waggon, drawn by six horses, comes hither once
a-week and returns.  Eight or 10 post-chaises are kept at
the inns for the road.  Five families in the parish keep each
a four-wheeled chaise; and four have whiskies.

   Country Parish.-Besides the town, the parish of Dum-
fries comprehends a considerable extent of country.  The
whole length, including the space occupied by the town, is
about six miles; the breadth, at an average from 2 to 3.
The Nith, bounding it on the W. and S. separates it from
Holywood, from a small part of Terreagles, and from Tro-
quire.  On the N. W. and N. it is bounded by the parishes
of Kirkmahoe and Tinwald; on the N. E. by Torthor-

Caerlaverock parishes.  This tract of country may be con-

at the S. E. end of the town, and runs towards Caerlaverock,
in a direction nearly parallel to the river.  The hills, in ge-

summit, or planted with clumps of wood; and the whole
scene is very picturesque.

   Soil, Lochermoss.-The soil of the N. E. side of the parish
is a reddish earth, upon a freestone bottom; but that on the
S. W. is, in general, a pretty strong clay.  Near the confines
of Torthorwald lies Lochermoss, an extensive morass, inter-

tion has gained a few fields from it, is one great dead flat,
spreading from the head of the parish, along its N. E. and
