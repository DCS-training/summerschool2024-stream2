else worthy of notice. About thirty-six years ago, the writer was
present at the opening of two tumuli in Annandale, in every re-
spect similar to the two above mentioned, in external form and ap-
pearance. In the centre of the first, was found a red flag laid level
on the earth, on which were placed two other flags of equal, size,
parallel to each other; and other two, one at each end; another
was laid on the top as a cover. In the interior of this, was an urn
containing ashes, with a few very thin plates of iron in the form of
rings, so completely corroded with rust, that, when exposed to the
air, they instantly crumbled into dust. The other likewise con-
tained an urn; but, from want of care in forming the tumulus, or
from some other cause, both the flags and urn were crushed and
broken in pieces, and no discovery could be made; but, from what
was observed in the former, it seemed probable, that they were Bri-
tish. Cesar informs us, when he invaded Britain, that the Br-
tish used iron for money,-," Annulis ferreis pro nummis utuntur."
