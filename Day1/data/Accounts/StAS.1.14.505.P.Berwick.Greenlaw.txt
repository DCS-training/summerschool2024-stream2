agriculture.  Befor the Union, Scotland had no foreign
market for her sheep and black cattle; and, consequently,
had no motive to raise more of these than her own do-
mestick consumption demanded; which, at that time, was
extremely small, as little butcher meat was then used.
But no sooner had the Union opened a market for these
valuable articles of commerce, than an influx of wealth,
unknown in former times, began to pour into the north-

as the price of cattle rose, gradually produced a happy
change in the system of agriculture; and was, doubtless,

that it would be as profitable to cultivate land for rearing
and feeding cattle, as for raising grain.  They, therefore,
enclosed their grounds, and united several of their small
farms.  These, they either improved themselves, or let to

them; and who had the good sense to perceive the ab-
