			LIBERTON.			11

   Modern Buildings.-The church of Liberton is a very hand-
some Gothic structure, with a fine tower in a commanding situa-
tion, erected in 1815 from a plan by James Gillespie Graham,
Esq. Its interior arrangements, however, are not in keeping with
the elegance of the external building. The gallery projects too
far, and is besides flat, dark, and too near the roof, which gives
the church an uncomfortable appearance, and prevents the people
from seeing and hearing with advantage. A slight alteration
would vastly improve it both in appearance and comfort. A very
handsome chapel was erected at Gilmerton in 1837. Besides
these public buildings, there are many very handsome houses in the
parish, the residences of the several proprietors. Amongst these
may be mentioned the Inch House, the oldest date to be found on
which is 1617: Mortonhall, an admirable house, finished in 1769,
and which the present proprietor has still farther improved:
The House of Drum erected by Lord Sommerville: Moredun, a
delightful residence, erected by Sir James Stewart: Niddry, a very
ancient baronial residence, with a large and handsome modern ad-
dition; and the house of Brunstane, erected by Lord Lauderdale in
1639. The houses of Southfield, Sunnyside, St Catherine's, and
Mount Vernon, are also excellent and beautifully situated.

			III-POPULATION.

   The population of this parish seems always to have been con-
siderable. From an old roll of communicants, without a date,
amongst the session records, it appears that the number of persons
in full communion with the church was then 700. In 1755 the po-
pulation was 2793 souls. In 1786, when Mr Whyte's Account
was made, the population amounted to 3457.

   The number of illegitimate births during the last three years
has been about 22.
   The population since 1831 has rather diminished. This has arisen
chiefly from the suspension of the coal-work at Gilmerton, which
has not only forced many of the colliers to seek work elsewhere,
but dispersed some of the carters, who formerly employed them-
selves in driving coals from Gilmerton to Edinburgh.
   Resident Proprietors.-There are very few resident proprietors
in this parish, which is a great disadvantage in every respect,
