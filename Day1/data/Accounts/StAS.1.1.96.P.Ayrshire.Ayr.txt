through two opposite windows of the newest steeple, broke
one end of the bell bomb-joist, and then descended to the
street, but did no more harm.  A boy in the neighbourhood 
was killed by another ball of fire.  Perhaps the only inunda-
tion that deserves notice happened in 1739, attended with a
great storm.  This raised the river much, and forced ships of
considerable burden quite out of the channel.
