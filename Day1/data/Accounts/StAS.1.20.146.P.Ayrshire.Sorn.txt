     Statistical Account

   The average number of births which have been register-
ed for the last 5 years, is 65; and of marriages 18.  The
number of births, however, is by no means complete, as
very few of the Dissenters register their childrens names.
No exact register of deaths can be kept, as so many of the
families have their burying-places in the neighbouring pa-
rishes.
   About 100 families, including the residing heritors, are
chiefly employed in the business of agriculture.

   The number of Dissenters from the Established Church
is about 78, the greatest part of whom are Burgher Sece-
ders.  The very few exceptions are Antiburghers and Ca-
meronians.

   Village of Dalgain.-Though there are several groups of
houses in the central parts of the parish, on both sides of the
river, inhabited chiefly by colliers and other labourers, yet
the only one that can properly come under the denomina-
tion of a village is Dalgain, situated a little to the eastward
