   Woods.-About 50 years ago, this parish abounded a great
deal more in wood than it does at present.  The back part
of the parish, ca11ed Glenalmon, seems to have been once one
continued forest, whereas now there is only one large pine
tree to be seen in the whole of it.  There is a considerable
quantity of woodland still in the fore part of the parish; it
consists of oaks, elms, beeches, birks, planes, and large saughs.
There are 5 woods upon the estate of Monzie, two upon that
of Calendar, and one upon that of Cultoquhey; and all of
them are very thriving.  Besides these, there are beautiful
and tall plantations around the mansion-houses of Monzie
and Cultoquhey.  These woods were cut and sold within
these few years, and brought a high price.  Upon the banks
of the rivers and burns, as well as in the dens, there is a con-
siderable quantity of shrubs, which are both useful and orna-
mental.

   Wild Animals.-The wild quadrupeds are hares, badgers,
rabbits, roe-bucks, deers, foxes and otters.  All the wild
fowls and birds of prey, which are natives of the North of
Scotland, frequent the woods: Thrushes, linnets, black-birds,
finches, starlings, patridges, wild ducks, herons, muir fowl;
hawks, ravens, hooded crows, and water crows; and some-
times we are visited by the eagle.  The birds of the migra-
tory kind are the swallow, cuckow, plover feldtfare and at
times the king's-fisher.

   State of Property, Services, etc.-During these last 30
years, there has been no transfer of property in the parish.
