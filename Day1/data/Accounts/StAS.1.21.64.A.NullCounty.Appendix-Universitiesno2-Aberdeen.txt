known to have been at that time established in the other uni-
versities of Scotland.  It is probable that this early institution
of a medical professorship in the University of Aberdeen, was
owing to the King's own predilection for that science, in which
he is said to have been "a willing and a skillful practi-
tioner:" and we find certain annual rents mentioned in the
foundation, as particularly assigned by the King for the sup-
port of this office.  Physicians appear to have been in great
request about that time in the north of Scotland; for in 1503
the town council of Aberdeen appointed 10 merks yearly to
be paid to James Cumin, physician, to induce him to stay in
the town; "till he could be provided with a salmon fishing
"of the usual rent, but without paying any grassum."  This
is probably the same James Cumin who died professor of me-
dicine in 1521; and he appears to have been the first who
held that office.

   Bishop Elphinston particularly attached to the study of Law.-
In the early part of his life, Bishop Elphinston had been at-
tached to the study of law, which he had taught for
six years in the university of Paris with great applause.  He
had acted as official under the bishop of Glasgow and arch-
bishop of St. Andrews: and large manuscript compilations of
canon law, made by him, are still preserved in eleven vo-
lumes folio in the library of the university.  These habits of
study will account for the particular attention he paid to the
science of law, by instituting two professorships in that facul-
ty; and with much probability we may ascribe to his sug-
gestion, that singular act of parliament enforcing the study of
the law, which has been celebrated as worthy of the antient
legislators.  It was passed in 1494; the same year in which
the papal bull for founding the University of Aberdeen had
