where the salmon delight to dwell in great abundance, and
to which they all run, if not prevented in their course.
There are no bridges worth noticing on any of these
waters, (only one on the last mentioned), which is the
occasion of great inconveniency to the inhabitants of this
parish in particular, and to the country in general, and no
less so to strangers and travellers from other countries.  This
bridge is of pretty long standing, extremely well built,

and is likely to stand for ages, if any the least attention is
paid to it, which it well deserves.  It is of mighty advan-

town of Thurso, and consist of 3 arches.  Before I close
this article, I should mention another water, which runs only
through a small part of this parish, at the extremities of it,
