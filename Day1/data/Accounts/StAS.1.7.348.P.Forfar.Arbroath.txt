years ago, and fitted up in a very neat and commodious
manner, capable to contain from 1800 to 2000 people.  It
is now rather small for the congregation, and it will be soon
necessary to have another, or a chapel of ease.  The right of
patronage formerly belonged to the Earl of Panmure, but fell
to the Crown by forfeiture in the year 1715.  The stipend
is 6 bolls of wheat, 22 bolls 2 firlots 3 pecks and 1 lippie of
barley, 23 bolls 2 firlots and 2 pecks of meal, and 54 l. 8 s.

church may amount to about 12 l.  The number of scholars
for 26 years past has been between 70 and 80.  The school-

the same for more than 30 years; of which the master re-

2 s. 2 d. as salary, of which the town pays 5 l. and the rest is
paid by the kirk-session.  The branches of education taught
are English, writing, arithmetic, Euclid's elements, mensura-
