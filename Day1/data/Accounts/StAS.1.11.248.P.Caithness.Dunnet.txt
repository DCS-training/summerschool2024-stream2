but the N. W.; and a small expence might render it secure
against it too, by throwing a pier from the land, to a large
clett, or out-standing rock, which is about 100 yards from
the shore.  Nature has already done that in part, by forming
a barr, or ridge of large stones, out to that rock; but that
barrier is not sufficiently high, to prevent the feas breaking
over it, at high water.  Mr. KNOX, in the course of his tour,
was much taken with that harbour, and seemed to think the
executing such a pier, an object worthy of attention.  This
could be effected with the greater ease, as there would be no
occasion for quarrying a single stone, or for carrying one above
200 yards.  The space to the E. of the pier, being cleared of
stones, would form an excellent harbour for small vessels; the
entrance to which is about 3 fathoms deep at low water, and
without any bar.  Brough has, besides, the advantage of be-
ing very contiguous to the belt fishing ground for cod and
ling; and hence is not only capable of being rendered a safe
harbour, but the most commodious fishing station in the parish,
or even on this side of the Pentland Frith.  The harbour of
Ham or Holm, is scarcely a mile to the east of Brough it
might also be rendered safe for small vessels, at little expence.
There is a superficial pier erected there already; and, the
ground within it being pretty well cleared of stones, vessels of,
or below 100 tons, find no inconveniency of loading or un-
loading a cargo, or even lying there for weeks in the summer
season.  It has, however, the inconveniency of a bar, or ridge
of sand and gravel, across the entrance of it, upon which
there is not sufficient depth of water for vessels in any great
burden, but with spring tides.  Scarfskerry is a narrow creek
between two rocks and affords a convenient landing for boats
with easy weather, but is not capable of being much im-
proved.
