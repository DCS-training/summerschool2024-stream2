   Marl.-There has been found in this parish a consider-
able quantity of shell-marl, very pure and white.  The
present proprietor of Castle-Huntly has fold near 60,000
bolls, at 8 d. and 9 d. per boll, (a cube of two feet), since
the year 1779; but is now exhausted, or lies so deep, it
is not worth the working.  In the bed containing this marl,
some red deers horns were found some years ago, umcom-
monly large.

   Coal.-There is also a tradition, that there are coals at
Myreside in this parish, and that some attempts to discover
them were begun in 1715, but failed from some cause, now
unknown.  However, a very ingenious chymist, lately, 
was so fully persuaded that coals might be found in the le-
vel grounds below Forgan, that he made some proposals to
work them at his own expence, but certain reasons made
the proprietors drop any attempt for the time.

   Growing Timber.-Upon every estate in this parish there
are great plenty of fine growing timber, of all ages, and va-
rious kinds, such as oak, ash, elm, plane, poplar, lime,
horse-chesnute, wallnute, beech, fir, larix, mountain-ash, ly-
bernum, etc. many of them from 100 to 150 years of age,
particularly at Longforgan, Mylnefield, Castle-Huntly, and
at the house of Drimmie; and also in hedge-rows all over
the parish, besides about 600 acres of fine thriving young
plantations, from 20 to 40 years old*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*in the year 1745, a survey was taken of the growing timber-on the estate
of Castle-Huntly, then Castle-Lyon.  It was found to contain 8557 trees of
all forts, valued at L. 2813:5:2.  Amongst these were a great number of 
sweet chesnut trees, which were sold some time afterwards, and were
bought up by ship carpenters, who considered them as good, if not better,
for the purpose of ship-building than oak.  There are a much greater num-
