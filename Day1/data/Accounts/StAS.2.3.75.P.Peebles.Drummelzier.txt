Cheviot in fineness of wool, suit the climate better.  The ayrsh
breed of cows prevail, and every attention is paid to improving them.
     Rent of Land.--There is some pasture-land let this year for
one season at L. 3. 3s. per Scots acre.  The rent of arable land
cannot be particularly specified, as all the farms consist partly
of arable, and partly of hill pasture, and a general rent is given
for the whole, some of the farmers putting more, and some less
on the arable; but the average among those who live by farm-
ing may be reckoned 18s. per Scots acre.  Some small lots are let
to tradesmen.  &c. at L. 2. 5s. per Scots acre. thought of very inferior
quality; but this is far beyond what could be given by those who
are to make their livelihood by farming.
     Husbandry.--The farm-buildings are generally good, and the en-
closures mostly dry stone dikes.  The crops are chiefly oats and
barley.  Bear or bigg is scarcely at all sown.  Wheat is some-
times tried but in small quantities.
     Procedure.--The average gross amount and value of raw produce
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as
follows :
Wheat, 75 bolls, of 4 bushels each,     -       -       -       L. 87  18  0
Pease, 90 do.           -       -       -       -       -          63   0  0
Oats, 1689 bolls, of 6 bushels each,    -       -       -        1168   5  0
Barley, 240 do.         -       -       -       -       -         240  18  0
Potatoes, 27 acres, from L. 3 to L. 15 per acre,        -         286   0  0
Turnips, 79 acres, from L. 2, 10s to L. 5 per acre,     -         283   0  0
   N. B.--There is scarcely any market for potatoes or turnips, which
        are mostly consumed on the farms.  The above is their estimat-
        ed value, but not what they actually bring in to the farmer.
Meadow hay, 41 acres, 3600 stones, at from 3 1/2d. to 4d.          91  13  4
Cultivated, 57 1/2 acres, 7475 stones, at from 5d. to 6d.         158  16  2
   The same remarks apply here as to potatoes and turnips.
Pasture.--Cattle, 209 milk cows or grazing cattle. from l. 2 to
     L. 3, 3s. each per annum,  -       -       -       -         532   0  0
    Sheep, 6600, from 4s. 6d. to 5s. each,      -       -        1502   0  0
                                                              ______________
                                                 Total  -     L. 4414   0  6
     Two acres of hill pasture may be considered as the average quan-
tity for a sheep, and two acres of arable land sown with grass
seeds may be considered as the average for a cow or ox.
                     V.--Parochial Economy.
     Market-Towns.--Ther is no market-town in the parish.  The
two nearest are those of Peebles and Biggar, the first 10, and the
other 8 miles distant.  As grain markets,--Lanark, which is distant
eighteen miles, and Dalkeith twenty-four.  There is a small vil-
lage in the parish containing fifteen or sixteen families.
     Means of Communication.--These are not very favourable.  Coal
is brought from Douglas, about twenty miles distant, and the near-
est lime is at Wiston, distant twelve miles.  Ther are two roads
