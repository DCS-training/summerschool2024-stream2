soldiers, sailors, bargemen, fishers, and pensioners.  The surplus
funds of this society, (which, however, can never be large, in con-
sequence of the terms on which the supply is afforded,) are re-
mitted to the Naval and Military Bible Society in London.
   In the following table a view is given of the income of each of
these societies, and of the number of Bibles and Testaments an-
nually distributed by them since the year 1832.

   Missionary and other Religious Societies.-There are many as-
sociations of these descriptions in Aberdeen, some of which are
supported exclusively by the members of the Established Church,
others by various Dissenting bodies, and some indiscriminately by
both.  As, however, they are all without any permanent funds or
vested property, it has been too often found that after being sup-
ported with spirit for a time, they have been liable to languish,
while new ones are instituted or old ones revived from time to time,
as occasional impulses are given.  Their existence and efficiency
are thus rendered so precarious, that it becomes not easy to say
how many of them are at any time in active operation.
   The following is, however, given as a tolerably correct list of
the principal ones:
   Two Religious Tract Societies,-the one, instituted in 1797 and
revived in 1811, has distributed about 1,500,000 tracts, partly gra-
tuitously, and partly sold at low prices;-the other lately instituted.
   Eight Missionary Societies, of which three are supported by
members of the Church of Scotland, and five by Dissenters of va-
rious denominations.
   One Gratis Sabbath Evening School Society, established in
1797-supported by Dissenters-has at present about twenty
schools, attended by nearly 1000 pupils.
   One Seamens' Friend Society, instituted in 1823, has a chapel
and a school for girls, (the male children being received into the

<FOOTNOTE>These two numbers are but average.  The whole distribution for
the year 1836 was 387; but as no report was published, it has not been found pos-
sible to ascertain the exact number of Bibles and Testaments which went to make up
this total.  The above numbers are given, therefore, as  being the average propor-
tional to the aggregate distribution of the other six years stated.
