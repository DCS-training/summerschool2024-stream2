     of Ordiquhill.

   There is but one inn in the parish.-Several hundreds of cat-
tle, sheep, etc. are carried annually from hence to the southward.
Land is commonly ploughed by oxen; oxen and horses, how-
ever, are joined to the same plough.-But to conclude this short
imperfect account; at a distance from the abodes of luxury
and vice, the wants of the people of this parish are but few;
and nothing seems more calculated for bettering their exter-
nal circumstances, and making their days glide on comforta-
bly, than extending leases to a greater length, and encourage-
ing them to inclose, drain, and improve their farms.  Such a
measure would also be highly beneficial to the proprietor*.
