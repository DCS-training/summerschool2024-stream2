   Manures, Obstacles to Improvement, &c.-The prin-
cipal part of the manure that is made use of in the pa-
rish, is what comes from the byre and stable, and is of
various kinds, as all the cattle are housed, summer and
winter, excepting with a few graziers and shepherds,
who never house any but their milch cows, and in winter
their work horses.  The summer dung, the farmers ge-
nerally mix in August, with some rich earth, or moss,
and perhaps a few ferns, and, where it may be conve-

ents upon one another, stratum above stratum, each in
its turn, they make up a mound which forms a compost
midding or dunghill.  In November, this composition is
carted away to some ley ground, which is ploughed in
January or February, and a second time in May; and
being sown with barley, produces a good crop.  All
the rest of the dung gathered throughout the year,
is divided between bear land and potatoes; which last
article is generally a sure crop in this country, and, to-
gether with a store of herrings, which they provide in
harvest, is the principal part of the people's subsistence
throughout the year.  The potatoes here are thought to
be of a superior quality to those which grow in the Low
Country, especially such as are to be seen about towns,
It is difficult to say, whether the poverty of the tenants,
the shortness of their leases, ignorance of farming, or a
strong attachment to a sea-faring life, particularly to the
herring fishing trade, operate most powerfully to the de-
triment of agriculture.  But one thing is evident, that all
these causes contribute, each of them their share, to produce
this bad effect; and they are all the natural consequence
of one cause, viz. a vain attempt of grasping, at the same
time, at the profits of husbandry, and the gains of a sea-
