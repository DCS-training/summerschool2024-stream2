years, or for certain long periods.
   2dly, That the tenants receive the farm houses on valua-
tion, and become bound to deliver them in like manner at
the expiry of their leases, on adequate payment made to them
for melioration, or similar payment by them to the heritors
in case of deterioration.
   3dly, That inclosures, to a certain extent, on a plan an-
nually agreed to by the heritor and tenant, be built by the
tenant; the value of which to be reimbursed by the heritor

the tenant may be enabled to proceed with additional inclo-
sures, or such other improvements as may have been specified
in the lease.

expence laid out by the tenant, in building inclosures, or other
improvements, during the two last periods of the lease.
   6thly, That a specific extent of arable and grass grounds
should be ascertained by skillful men, to be competent for
maintaining a sub-tenant's family, on the supposition that the
same is managed by him, without the assistance of the prin-

milies of this description.
   7thly, That one half, or thereby, of the before mentioned
extent of arable and grass ground, should be alloted for a
cottar's or a boll-man's family, each of whom may be con-
