   The value of the minerals cannot at present be accurately de-
termined.
   Wages.-Farm servants or hinds, married, are engaged by the
year; their usual allowance per annum being L. 16 in money: 65
stones of oatmeal; 4 or 6 bushels of pease or barley; 4 bolls or
16 cwt. of potatoes, with a free house and garden,-in all equal
to 1Os. per week. They have no lost or broken time; are a con-
tented and sober set of men, who, without meddling with affairs of
State, mind the bringing up of their families, and their own
business. Their children, when above twelve years of age, are
generally employed upon the farm, and are allowed, according
to their years, from 7d. to 9d. per day,-the latter sum of 9d.
being the customary allowance for a full-grown woman at out-
door work. In harvest their wages are higher, the lowest rate then
being 1s. per day, with victuals. Labouring men are engaged
by the week, and receive from 9s. to 12s. Masons, millwrights,
carpenters, plumbers, &c. charge from 3s. to 3s. 6d. per day.
   Live-Stock.-Of the few cattle reared in the parish, the Tees-
water or short-born is the common kind; but the farmers derive
their chief supply, generally of the Highland breed, from the
Edinburgh markets. The keep of a bullock of 40 imperial stones
on full feeding may be estimated at L. 7 per annum, and the graz-
ing of a cow for the season at L. 6.
   There are almost no sheep bred, the farmers supplying them-
selves with ewes in lamb from the neighbouring spring markets,
