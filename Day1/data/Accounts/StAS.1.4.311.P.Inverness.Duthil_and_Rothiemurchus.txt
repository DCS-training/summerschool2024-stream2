2467; acres in moss and moor adjoining to the arable and
meadow, 4650.  What quantity of ground lies waste, or
in common, being the hilly part of the parish, I cannot
ascertain.  At least a third of the parish is under wood.
The parish supplies itself abundantly with provisions.
The only articles of export are black cattle and sheep.
The real rent of the parish is about L. 1100 Sterling.

of gentlemen's families resided, there were usually about
70 scholars, some of whom were sent yearly to the Uni-

pence of living, that no proper schoolmaster can be had;
so that the gentlemen are obliged to send their children,
at a great expence, to distant counties to school.  The
salary of the Society school is L. 9 Sterling, with suitable
conveniencies, furnished by the tenants, in whose district
the school is stationed.  The number of scholars, at an a-
