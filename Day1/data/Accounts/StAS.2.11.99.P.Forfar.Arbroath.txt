	Divine service in the Established church is in general well at-
tended. There is evening service in the parish church during five
months in the year, commencing in the month of April. Such a
service,--even if it were continued all the year round,--may be
deemed almost necessary, as, in many families, circumstances, often
unavoidable, occur, which prevent some of the inmates from getting
out to church during the day. Yet it is to be feared that the lau-
dable object for which "the exercise," as it is familiarly termed,
was originally established, has come to be abused. Many of those
who attend might be better employed in instructing their children
at home. Among the dissenters, with whom such services are
common, the evening is accounted the grand diet. The best pre-
pared discourse is reserved till then, and seats are provided for all
who contribute a halfpenny to the collection, and thus assist in
keeping up the money concerns of the meeting-house. Amidst the
good which might result from evening services in Arbroath, if at-
tended only by those for whom they are necessary, this evil has
arisen, that they have tended to add to the number of those be-
longing to the Established church who rent no sittings, but who
might easily, in most cases, pay a moderate seat rent. These have
got into the way of trusting to free seats at the "evening exercise;"
and their families are brought up in habits of carelessness in regard
