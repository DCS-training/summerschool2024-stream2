     of Bothwell.

     NUMBER XVII.

     PARISH OF BOTHWELL,

     (COUNTY OF LANARK, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR,
     AND PRESBYTERY OF HAMILTON.)

     By the Rev. Mr. MICHAEL MACCULLOCH, Minister.

     Name.

   THE origin of the name is uncertain.  Both, in Cel-
tic, Syriac, Chaldee, and Saxon, signifies "a habita-
"tion or dwelling."  Huil, in Celtic, is "a flood or wa-
"ter;" and compounded with Both, Both-uil or Bothwell,
is "a habitation beside or on the waters."  This sense is
confirmed by Llhuid's Archael. Brit. Bullet, Baxter, and
Verstigan*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Ed. Llhuid's Arch‘nol. Brit. voce "to dwell," Bod is Welsh-Celtic for
"habitation."-Bullet's Memoires sur la Langue Celtique, tom. iii.  p.4.
Bod signifies "habitation."-Baxte's Glossary, Bodo means "aquotus."
-Verstigan's Restitution of decayed Intelligence, words ending in well
denote places beside water.
