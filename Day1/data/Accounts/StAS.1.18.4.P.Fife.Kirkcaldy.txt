spire.  The tower contains the town-clock and bell, and
serves as a repository for the archives of the burgh.

   The Church.-The church stands on an elevated situation,
on the top of the bank, which rises immediately behind the
town.  It is a large unshapely pile, that seems to have been
reared at different times, to suit the growing population of
the parish, and in the construction of which convenience has
been more consulted than unity of design or beauty.  The
nave or body of the church, is in the antient Gothic, or rather
the Norman stile of architecture; without buttresses; with
low semicircular arches, supported by short thick columns,
and having aisles behind them.  The choir is fitted up in com-
mon with the nave for the reception of the parishioners; and
a large wing has been added for their farther accommodation.
Close to one end of the church stands the steeple; which in
its original form was a plain, and not unhandsome square
tower with a cornice, above which it was covered with a
roof.  But it has been raised beyond its original height, by the
addition of a smaller, and a very disproportionate tower, ter-
minating in a pyramid.

   The Sands-On the one side of the town, the sea is separated
from it by a beach of firm and level sand; on which the in-
habitants have always, excepting at the height of the tide, a
safe and agreeable walk; and by which the traveller may
generally avoid the uneasy jolting of a long and rugged pave-
ment.  As the sand continues firm and smooth, and the ground
shelves gradually for a great way into the sea, this place is pe-
culiarly favourable for sea bathing; for which purpose there
has been for some years an increasing resort to it, during the
months of summer and harvest.
