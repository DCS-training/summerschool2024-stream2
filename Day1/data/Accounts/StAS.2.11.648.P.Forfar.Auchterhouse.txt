                     PARISH OF AUCHTERHOUSE.

           PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

               THE REV. GEORGE WINEHOUSE, MINISTER.

              I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE name of this parish is supposed to be derived
either from the Gaelic word Achter, "the high ground on which
the church, the House of God, stands," or from Achadh Torr,
pronounced Ach-tor, "the house with the tower in the field,"
which is descriptive of a ruin near the manor-house of Auchter-
house.
   Boundaries.-The parish is bounded on the east by that of
Tealing; on the south-east, by Mains and Strathmartine; on
the south, by Liff; on the west and south-west, by Lundie and
Foulis; on the north-west, by Newtyle; and on the north and
north-east, by Glammis.
   Figure and Elevation.-The figure of the parish is that of a
triangle, the base of which forms its south boundary, and rests on
the narrow valley through which Difhty water runs; and the two
sides, indented in several places, rise to a bend in a hill-stream,
on the north side of the south ridge of the Hill of Sidla, by which
it is separated from Strathmore. Its exposure is to the south,
and its surface is varied by undulating acclivities, which point east
and west, and increase in elevation and steepness from south to
north. The acclivities to the south of the church, and that on
which the church stands, are accessible, and under cultivation;
but that to the north of the church, which forms the Hill of Sidla,
is precipitous, and available only for pasturage and forest planting.
The elevation of the summit of the south acclivity is 500 feet;
that on which the church stands is 800 feet; and that of the
White Sheets of Sidla, which is the highest ground in the parish,
is 1400 feet above the level of high water mark at Dundee.
   Extent and Geology.-The superficial extent of this parish is
about 8 1/2 square miles, or 5448 imperial acres. Of that extent,
