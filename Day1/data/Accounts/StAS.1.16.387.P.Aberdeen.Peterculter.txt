which is below the embankment.  About two miles below
this Haugh, a good deal of corn was taken out of the river,
cared for, and stacked; it was claimed by the tenant, who
possessed a part of the Haugh of Cults, and whose crop was
then carried away; but the man who saved the corn would
not give it up.  This was a subject of litigation before the
Sheriff, until the litigants found it expedient to terminate
the dispute over a glass.  The latter part of the narrative
may, perhaps, need an apology, because it relates to ano-
ther parish.
   A long time since, the river Dee had, for the space of a
quarter of a mile, entirely shifted its channel, a little be-
low this church, and cut through a part of the estate of
Culter.  Formerly, the whole of that estate, and of this pa-
rish, was situated north of the river, which was the boun-
dary.  Now, a small farm, belonging to the estate of Cul-
ter, is south of the river.  This farm is called the Insch,
and had long been an island.  Here is a salmon-fishing,
which yields about L. 40 Sterling of yearly rent.  The
old channel was lately very distinct, but is now divided be-
twixt the two neighbouring proprietors, and put into a estate
of cultivation.  I cannot learn from record or tradition the
exact time when the course of the river was altered; but,
according to the best information which I have got, it can-
not be less than two centuries back.  This had probably
happened when a gentle thaw succeeded a long and intense
frost, when there was water enough to break and float the
ice, but not enough to carry it over the shallows; at these
it sticks and stops the current, which recoils, and carries
back the ice with amazing force and velocity; the channel
is crammed with sheets of ice; many are thrown at some
distance, and the water shifts its course.  About 12 years
since, the ice was repelled in this manner up the river Dee,
and from it, up the burn of Culter, so that it was thrown
