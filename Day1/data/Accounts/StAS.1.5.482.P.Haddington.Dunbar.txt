the present patron, and is titular of the tithes, which are
very considerable in this parish.-The church, till lately,
was, in the inside especially, one of the worst, and most in-
convenient, perhaps in Scotland.  The floor was funk be-
low the ground without, which made it always damp and
cold.  It was repaired by the heritors in 1779, stoored
with deal, and ceiled in the roof.  A part of the long bo-

one in East Barns.  Their congregations are made up of a
collection of people from all the parishes in the neighbour-

They are chosen and paid by the town.  This parish

settled by the heritors, (with a salary of L. 8: 6: 8
Sterling,) at West Barns, where it was much wanted, 
to accommodate the inhabitants of the west end of the 
parish, which is populous, containing about 800 inhabi-
