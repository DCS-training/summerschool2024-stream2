monly money for grinding, or barley making; and even
in some places, thirlage is converted into money.  There
are very few tradesmen.  Ploughmen have ordinarily
L. 14 Sterling a-year.  Prices are regulated by the Had-
dington market.  Fuel is chiefly coal.

   Stipend, School, Poor.-The stipend is 17 1/10 bolls wheat,
34 2/10 bolls bear, 69 2/10 bolls oats, and L. 9 Sterling, which
comprehends vicarage tithes, communion elements, and
L. 20 Scots for grass.  The glebe is 4 acres.  The church
is an old building, very thick in the walls.  Lord Blan-
tyre is patron.  There are 5 heritors, one of whom resides.
-The schoolmaster's salary is L. 100 Scots.-There are no
vagrants in the parish; and the poor and other necessary
charges, are maintained ordinarily by the collections, mort-
cloths, and an hearse, purchased by the session, and let for
hire.

   Antiquities.-In the little village of Bolton, there re-
main some vestiges of an house, and a park on the W. side
of it, still called the orchard, about 4 acres, which is said
to have belonged to John Hepburn, a friend of Bothwell's,
who fled with him from Dunbar, when Bothwell escaped
from the battle of Falside, in Queen Mary's time.  It
seems that Bolton came then into the possession of Mait-
land of Lethington, who is the ancestor of the family of
Lauderdale.-There is a place called still Chesters, where
there are vestiges of a camp between 5 and 6 acres, with a
rampart and ditch; but there is no record concerning it.
