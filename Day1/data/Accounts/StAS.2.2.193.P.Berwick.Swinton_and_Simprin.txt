                    SWINTON AND SIMPRIN.                      193

parish of Swinton amounted to 351, and of Simprin to 143. Since
that time, the population of Simprin has decreased considerably,
and is now limited to the number which is required for the cultiva-
tion of the soil. In 1791, the population of the conjoined parishes
amounted to 898, shewing an increase, since 1755, of 404. Dir-
ing this, or rather the latter half of this period, the land was regu-
larly subdivided, and its present agricultural system entered upon.
To this important change in the state and management of the soil,
and the wants which it created, the extraordinary increase in the
population is to be attributed. In 1811, the population amounted
to 866; in 1821, 919; in 1831, 971, of whom 460 were males,
and 511 females.
   The increase of the population since 1791 is inconsiderable, and
may be accounted for partly by the enlargement of the village of
Swinton, which affords accommodation to coal-carters and others,
not strictly dependent for their support upon the land of the parish,
and partly by the additional labourers required for a more careful
husbandry.
   The number of inhabitants in the village of Swinton is 450, the
remaining 520 being in all respects a country and agricultural po-
pulation.

   Character and Habits of the People.-There are no customs,
games; or amusements, which can be mentioned as peculiar to
the parish or the district. Occasional trials of strength or skill

<FOOTNOTE>The number of families stated in the abstract of the Government census is 288,
and no bachelors.
   +The averages of deaths and marriages may be incorrect, as individuals dying in
the parish are often buried in other parishes; while persons not connected with it, but
whose forefathers or relations are buried there, are brought sometimes from a distance
to occupy their cemeteries. The number of marriages also cannot be easily ascer-
tain as a large portion of them are irregularly contracted at Coldstream, or at some
other place on the border of the two kingdoms.
