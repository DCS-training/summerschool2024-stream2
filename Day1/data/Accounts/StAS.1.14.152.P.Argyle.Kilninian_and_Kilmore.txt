     Statistical Account

   Exports and Imports.-The average quantity of kelp
manufactured annually in this parish, is from 170 to 180
tons.  The manufacturing costs about 30 s. a ton, and the
kelp is sold, in this country, from 3 L. 10 s. to 6 L. the ton,
according as the market rules.  The only other exports
worth mentioning, are black cattle, sheep and wool.  The
black cattle, for the most part, are sold lean at a fair,
which begins in this parish on the 13th of May yearly,
and is continued in the other parishes of the island, upon
3 different days thereafter, with a day always intervening.
The imports into the parish are many, particularly oat-
meal, seed-corn, seed-potatoes, leather, salt, and a variety
of merchants goods.  The customhouse has not been long
enough established to ascertain the annual average quan-
tity of each.

   General Character.-All the people of the parish are of
the Established Religion, excepting 2 or 3 obscure fami-
lies introduced, a few years ago, from South Uist, who
are of the Popish persuasion; and since their arrival a-
mong Protestants, have got so much the better of their
bigotry, that they now attend our publick meetings for
worship, as often as they are held near their place of re-
sidence.  The people, in general, are fond of religious in-
struction, sober, honest and industrious, if they had a sub-
ject to work upon.  They are also humane and chari-
table, in proportion to their circumstances.  But from
this general character, there are many exceptions, as
might reasonably be expected in so populous a district,
and in a situation so uncultivated.

quires; a maid servant has somewhat less than the half of these wages; a
day-labourer cannot be had under 6 d. a-day, and his victuals, or from
10 d. to 15 d. without victuals.  Tradesmen are commonly paid according
to the quantity of work they perform.
