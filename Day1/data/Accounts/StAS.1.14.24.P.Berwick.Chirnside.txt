vancement in opulence and population are turned, al-
most wholly, upon the multiplication and encourage-
ment of cotton-mills, and other such manufacturers, as
correspond not only to the domestic use and consumption
of their articles, but suppose the greatest imaginable

ship of it in other countries, the change of fashion in
clothes and dress, and the variable, and often unaccount

and the riches, derived from them are fure.  The Bri-

ternal and permanent opulence, require only to join to 
it, and their home manufactures, the fisheries of their
seas, to have a population unimpaired by long unhealth-
