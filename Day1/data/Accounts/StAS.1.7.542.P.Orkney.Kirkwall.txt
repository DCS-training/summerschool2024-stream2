With this they only scratch the surface of the ground in the
spring, for they labour none in winter nor in harvest.  The
only manure they use is rotten ware or sea-weed, alone or
mixed with turf, and without ever giving it a summer fallow
to destroy the weeds, with which it is generally overrun.
They sow on it the only grain they have, a small kind of
black oats, and a puny sort of bear alternately.

   Air.-The air in Kirkwall and around it through the pa-

spongy nature of the soil that retains it, together with small
lochs of fresh water here and there to be met with, are to be

and in the bowels-the king's evil-frequent colds and
coughs, with asthma, consumptions, rheumatisms, and drop-
sies.

that is about a mile and an half from Kirkwall, on the post-
road to Holm.  It has been long known by the name of
Blakeleys-well, for what reason is not said.  It seems to be a
chalybeate; and has been frequently used with much effect in
removing complaints of the stomach and intestines.-The
shores not very high but rocky, are washed by the sea for a-
bout 15 miles; in which there are sometimes caught silaks
and cuths, which are the young of the seath fish, small cod,
