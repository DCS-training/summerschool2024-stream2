                   I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-The name of this parish seems always to have been
the same, with a slight difference in the orthography, being some-
times written Spott, and sometimes Spot. It is a name which ap-
pears not inappropriately to have been given to it, on account of
its retired sheltered situation.
   Extent and Boundaries.--The parish is ten miles long, and five
broad. It is intersected by an extensive tract of land, which till
lately was in a state of common, and known by the name of Dun-
bar common, and considered to belong to the parish of Dun-
bar. It is now divided; and whether the portions of it contiguous
to other parishes are now to be regarded as forming part of these
parishes, has not been determined. Were it not for the interpo-
sition of this common, the parish of Spott would be of an irre-
gular oblong figure. It is bounded on the north by Dunbar; on the
east by Dunbar and Innerwick; on the south by Cranshaws; and
on the west by Stenton and Dunbar.
   Topographical Appearances.-The whole parish is an alterna-
tion of hill and dale, the hills gradually increasing in height
till we reach the highest ridge of this part of Lammermuir,
700 feet above the level of the sea. Doon hill, which is situated
