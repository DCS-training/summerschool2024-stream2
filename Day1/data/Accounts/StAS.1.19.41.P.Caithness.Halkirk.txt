inconvenient, though repaired four tlmes, and at consider-
able expence during that period, viz. 23 years.  The last
of these repairs is going on just now, at the estimated sum
of L. 154 Sterling; and as soon as the undertaker puts them
off his hands, they will call for another immediate repair,
whether the minister calls for it or not.  It is to be regretted,
that heritors, from a mistaken notion of saving their purses,
should so unaccountably injure their own interest, and in-
commode the minister, when both might have been avoided
with little expence.
   The glebe is, on the whole, very good land, but consi-
derably short of the minimum.  It only sows 3 bolls bear,
supposing all of it to be sown with that grain, and will not
graze one cow.  There is reason to believe that it was lar-
ger, and that it was curtailed by the encroachments or de-
predations of the conterminous tenants in time of vacancies,
and never yet enquired into.  This is the move credible,
from the report of a very old member of this presbytery,
dead several years ago, who informed the present incum-
bent that this was the case, for that he saw the decreet of
designation by Bishop John Forbes, of this diocese, in the
custody of Mr Munro above mentioned.

   Mission and Mission-house, etc.-Besides the church, there
is a meeting or mission-house, in the Highlands of the pa-
rish, at the distance of 9 miles from the church, where the
minister of the parish was wont to preach every 4th Sab-
bath as a voluntary deed, if not prevented by bad weather,
or speats in the waters, which are too frequent, especially
in winter.  The house is pretty large, was built, and is
still supported by the inhabitants of that district of the pa-
rish, for their own and the minister's accommodation, at
very considerable expence for them.  Of late years, they
have a missionary supported at their own expence also.  It
