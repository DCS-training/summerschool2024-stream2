  Vultur albicilla, more correctly designated Falco albicilla, the
Earne, once frequented the cliffs at the head of the parish, but
disappeared from it several years since.
  In a late edition of White's Natural History of Selborne, the
editor enumerates several accidental varieties of British birds, among
which he had himself seen a mottled blackbird, white crows, a
white robin, a white sparrow, and a white jackdaw.  Similar va-
rieties of the pleasant have been noticed here for several succes-
sive years, some entirely white, and others pied or speckled. Four
birds, two of them white and the others variegated, have been seen
in the same covey.
  Fishes. -Salmon come up the "Manner water" in great abun-
dance to deposit their spawn, about the month of October; and we
are afraid that few of them are allowed to return to sea. When
the stream has subsided after a flood, and become sufficiently clear
to admit of the fish being seen, bands of poachers, armed with their
long-shafted tridents, ( called "leisters,") may be seen, sometimes
during the day, but oftener by the red glare of their torches during
the night, beating every foot of the water for their prey, which,
after a fatiguing run of sixty miles, are transfixed without much
effort at escape. The number of fishes which, from the month of
October to that of February, are thus slaughtered in an unwhole-
some condition, and generally before they have time to spawn, is
almost incredible. Upwards to the source of the Tweed, and a
considerable way down the river, as well as in many Of its tribu-
