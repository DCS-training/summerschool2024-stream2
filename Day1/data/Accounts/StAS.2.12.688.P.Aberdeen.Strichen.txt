   Parochial Registers.-There are some old registers of the kirk-
session, as far back as 1676, and it appears a register had been
kept, from 1701 to 1735, of marriages, and baptisms, and minutes
of kirk-session.  After that time, till 1785, (with the exception of
the insertion of baptisms), no register appears to have been kept;
or, if there had been any, they must be lost.  From these early
registers, it appears that the Presbyterian form of worship had
been always observed.  Since the year 1701, there have been
four incumbents, including the present, viz. Mr Udny, settled in
1701; Mr Smith, 1748; Mr Anderson, 1785, and who died in
1806.

   There are three medical practitioners in, and near the village,
and the senior of them has practised with success for the long
period of thirty-eight years.
   The people resident in the village, and throughout the parish,
are, in general, healthy; and some of them have reached a great
age, being upwards of ninety.  They are distinguished for their
moral and correct conduct, and their orderly and industrious ha-
bits.  They are constant in their attendance on religious ordi-
nances, strictly observe the Sabbath, and have always shown a
laudable desire for the religious education of their children, and
not a few have had the benefit of an university education.  In
proof of this, there are alive at present, three clergymen. of the
Established Church, having the charge of parishes, and five pro-
bationers, all natives of this parish.
