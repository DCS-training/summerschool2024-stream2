     The Statistical Account

of proprietors.  The farm of Dunrobin, occupied by Earl
Gower and Lady Sutherland, consisting of near 500 acres
arable, besides pasture land, and fir plantations and others,
is inclosed, So is the farm of Uppat, purchased some years
ago and improved by the late Col. James Sutherland, and
now occupied by his son, George Sackville Sutherland, Esq.
which consists of 300 acres arable and grass lands, besides a
large plantation of firs.  There are three farms besides, which
taken together consist of 200 acres, that are inclosed,
   The yearly rent payable out of the lands is about 1000
bolls victual, and 200 l. sterl. money; which, valuing the
victual at 10 s. per boll, makes 700 l. sterling.  But victual
in these years fells at a higher rate, especially since the whisky
stills were introduced: for though there are but few stills in
all this county, the neighbouring counties of Caithness and
Ross are full of them, which contributes to raise the price of
victual here.  Were the growth of this county used only for
bread, there would be a sufficiency of victual in the county,
at an average, to serve its inhabitants.
   There are a great many potatoes raised in this parish; not
many turnips, exclusive of what are raised on the farms of
Dunrobin and Uppat.

   Farm of Dunrobin.-This farm is perhaps, in proportion
to its extent, one of the best in the kingdom; not on ac-
count of the goodness of the soil only, but likewise on account
of its peculiarly favourable situation.  Besides a south expo-
sure, it is sheltered on the north by a hill extending from one
end to the others being 2 miles in length.  There is a beau-
tiful bank extending from one end to the other, most of it
covered with trees of various kinds; upon the middle of
which the house of Dunrobin stands.  It lies at the distance of
between 200 and 300 yards from the sea, except that part
