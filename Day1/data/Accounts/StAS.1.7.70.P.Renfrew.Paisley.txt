   It is believed, that no money is laid out with greater at-
tention than this, or can go farther in promoting the true
purposes of charity.  The people who receive it are much
better pleased than even to be more comfortably provided for
out of their own houses.  This is a spur to industry in those
who are able to make themselves any help, and the money is
raised in a way that can never be felt, three fourths of the
whole sum being the yearly contributions of three large con-
gregations at the church-doors, and given mostly in half-
pence, except upon extraordinary occasions. 
   In such a town an hospital is certainly necessary for main-
taining poor and destitute children, and as an asylum for the
infirm and the aged, who have none to take care of them.

The house is capacious:  It is built in a free and airy part of
the town, and has a large garden belonging to it.  It is un-
der the management of 15 directors, who are chosen annual-
ly; three from the town council, one from each parish session,
and the rest chosen by the council from among the inhabi-
tants at large.  It is conducted upon the strictest principles
of oeconomy, and with great attention to health, cleanliness.
and good order, and has hitherto answered the ends of its
institution as much, perhaps, as any of the kind.
   The following is a state of the expence, and of the per-
sons maintained in it for the last three years.
