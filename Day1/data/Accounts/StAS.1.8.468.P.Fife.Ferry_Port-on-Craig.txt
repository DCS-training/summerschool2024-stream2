people in the lower ranks of life.  Some drive coals from
the coal-works in this country, at the distance of 9 or 10 sta-
tute miles, which they sell at 7s. the cart load.  Some of the
cottagers, in the country parish, burn dryed turf and whins;
but they all use coal as the principal part of their fuel.  The
villagers in the Ferry use coal only, which they purchase
at the above prices.

   Character.-The people are peaceably disposed, and firmly
attached to the present happy civil constitution of their coun-
try.  They all adhere to the principles of the established
church of Scotland; and regularly attend divine worship in
the parish kirk, excepting one Unitarian, (who, however, fre-
quently hears sermon with the other parishioners), and one
Seceder; both of whom came lately into this parish from
Dundee.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are no lime-stone quar-
ries; but lime is brought by sea from Sunderland.  It is
sold at the Ferry at 1s. 6d. Sterling the boll of wheat measure,
or 2s. 4d. Sterling the barley measure.  Some drive time by
land carriage, at the distance of 10 and 15 miles, which can
be afforded at 3s. 1d. the boll, barley measure.  The only
stone, got in this ground, is a hard whin stone, which makes
strong and lasting work when built with good lime.-There
are two mills for grinding meal, to which the parishioners are
thirled only for what meal they make, or what malt is brew-
ed within the parish; but not for the whole crop of corn
growing on the several farms.-As there is a constant weekly
demand for all kinds of country vivres in Dundee, some per-
sons make it their business to go through this part of the coun-
try, and gather them up for the Dundee market.  The prices
here are, therefore, always regulated by what they fetch
