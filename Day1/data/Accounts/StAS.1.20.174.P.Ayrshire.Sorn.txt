     Statistical Account

general, however, the gifts of prophecy and of discerning
spirits, which were so fondly ascribed to Mr Peden and
some of his fellow-sufferers, will not easily be admitted by
thinking men in the present age; especially when it is re-
collected, that these gifts were sometimes exercised in detec-
ting and exposing witches.  But whatever errors and im-
perfections a more enlightened and peaceable age may dis-
cover in the principles and conduct of this good man, and
in those who acted and suffered with him, they will always
be entitled to the esteem and gratitude of their countrymen,
not only on account of the high virtues which they posses-
sed, but also on account of the share which they had in pre-
paring the way for the establishment of our civil liberties
by the Revolution, and in maintaining, at the expence of a
thousand hardships and perils, our Ecclesiastical constitution;
a constitution which, though like that of most other Chri-
stian societies, built perhaps upon too narrow a foundation,
has, nevertheless, at a very small expence, been in several
respects eminently serviceable to the country.
   Though, therefore, this constitution be not without its
enemies, and though even the rock of poverty, on which it
was said, by a celebrated statesman, to be founded, be not
absolutely impregnable, yet it is to be hoped, that when its
basis is extended a little, it may still stand immoveable for
ages, and prove a rock of defence to solid learning, found
morals, sacred truth, and rational liberty, both civil and re-
ligious.
