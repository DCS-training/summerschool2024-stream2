   By the nauseous draught of train oil in Lapland, and the
more disgusting beverage of Otaheite, it may be inferred,
that man cannot be satisfied with the simple element alone of
water.  From the different circumstances concomitant on
the excise law in England and in Scotland, it would not be
difficult to investigate why beer has been the prevailing drink

ration of its ancient families to their paternal fortunes; by
increasing the independence of its judges, particularly the
Sheriff-substitutes, on whom the administration of justice

easy to model the law in such a manner, that beer, instead of
whiskey should in a short time be generally adopted by all
the labouring people in Scotland; and, by this means, while
he would contribute to maintain, in a high degree, the puri-
ty of the morals, and the soundness of the constitutions of
his countrymen, he would at the same time expand their
countenances, and improve their whole exterior form to the
highest elegance of symmetry and beauty.
