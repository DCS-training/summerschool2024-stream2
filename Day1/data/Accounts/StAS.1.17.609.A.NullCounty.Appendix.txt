winds in deep sequestered glades under the south side of the
house in its eastern direction and presses on towards Bruns-
toune, Pennycuick, Old Woodhouselec, Roslin, Hawthorn-
den, Melville Castle, and Dalkeith where it is joined by the
South Esk, from Arniston, Dalhousie, New ottle, etc. on its
way to Inveresk, Musselburgh, and the Frith of Forth.  The
principal glen, at the back of the house, separates Mid-Lo-
thian from Tweedale, and Pennycuick parish from that of
Linton; but besides this one, within a mile beyond it, to the

and rivulet, all running parallel to it, and uniting their
streams, in succession, below the Harbour Craig.  Thus united,
they join the Esk between and the lower end of the Steel, at
a little haugh about a quarter of a mile below the house,
which, by taking a sudden turn and circuit before they meet,
they almost surround.
   What makes these particulars interesting, is, that at this
time, when the property of Mr Forbes, this place was dis-

Tytler in his edition of King James's Poems, 'near Pentland
'Hills, where the scenes of this pastoral poem were laid, the seat

'time, I well remember to have heard Ramsay recite, as his
'own production, different scenes of the Gentle Shepherd,

'my honourable friend, Sir James Clerk of Pennycuick,

the same testimony.-P. S.  The above note was shown to
