the ground toward the east; in which there are five different
strata, or seams, from 3 to 4 1/2 feet thick, all of which
are wrought at present to a very considerable extent.
these seams have been wrought for many years, so that
all near the city, at a moderate depth, has been dug out.
Some of the pits are at present above 60 fathoms deep, and
most of them are obliged to be wrought by the assistance of
steam engines.  The price of coals varies at the different
pits, being from 2 s. 9 d. to 3 s. 3 d. per cart, of 12 cwt.;
when delivered in any part of the city, from 3 s. 6 d. to
4 s.  In some of these pits, there is a vein of iron stone of
very good quality, of a whitish colour, which is used in the
smelting furnaces in the neighbourhood,  There is also in
the till found in these pits, many impressions of fern and
others plants, and shells of different kinds;  and in the neigh-
bourhood there are many fossils marine bodies, particularly
different species of shells and entrochi.
   The WATER, with which the city is in general supplied,
is not of the best quality, as most of the springs contain se-
lenite in greater or lesser proportion; and some of them
contain iron, which is for the most suspended by the
carbonic acid.  One spring, not far from the city, contains
calcareous earth, which it deposits, in its  course, on the ve-
getables, etc. forming therewith sundry incrustations.  To-
wards the west part of the city, however, the water is much
purer than towards the east;  and there is in the Green, be-
longing to the community, a spring of water of the very
best quality in the country.  The quantity of it, however, is
not sufficient to afford a supply to the whole inhabitants;
and it lies so much below the level of the greatest part of
the city, that it has prevented its being conducted into it.
Many proposals have been made, for supplying the city
with water from sources in the neighbourhood, but the
