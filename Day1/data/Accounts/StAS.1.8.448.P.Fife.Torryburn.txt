     PARISH OF TORRYBURN.

     (County and Synod of Fife-Presbytery of Dumfermline)

     By the Rev. Mr. DAVID BALFOUR.

     Erection and Name.

   THE parish, now known by the name of Torryburn, in-
cludes the parishes of Torry and Crombie.  When their
union took place, cannot be ascertained; but it appears, from
certain papers relating to the stipend, that it must have been
before the year 1623.  The name of the former, Torry, signi-
fies, in Gaelic, the King's Height, and, with the addition of
burn, the Scotch word for a rivulet, is now the general name
of both.  This addition seems to have been suggested by a
small stream, which runs along the south east part of the prin-
cipal village in the parish, and divides the two baronies of
Torry and Crombie*.
