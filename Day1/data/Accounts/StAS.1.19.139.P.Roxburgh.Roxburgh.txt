abundantly yielding food for man and beast, men grasp in
joyful expectation that halcyon era, when the spears of
every land shall, as here, be beat into plough-shares, and
the "still voice" charm the warriors confused noise into
perpetual silence.  Musing over the razed foundations of
Roxburgh, once the fourth burgh of distinction in Scotland;
the traces of those halls, which rung twice seven days in
honour of Royal births and nuptials; and the rubbish of
domes, where Princes and Nobles were wont to fit in state,
the heart feels for the transient nature of sublunary joy or
greatness, and the Christian's soul aspires after mansions
above, where moth and rust corrupt not*.
