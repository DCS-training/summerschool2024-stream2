	3. A legacy of L. 50, of which little more than L. 30 was rea-
lized, to be expended in clothing the most indigent of the poor.
	4. A donation of L. 100, the interest to be applied in educating
twelve poor children.
	The collections- at the church door amount per annum to about
L.90; average amount of mortcloth dues per annum, L. 36.
	The average weekly number of persons on the session funds is
14. There are 238 poor people on the parish, supported at the
rate of about L. 14 per week, or L. 800 nearly per annum. The
allowance to each individual is from 6d. to 2s. 6d. per week. Im-
mense numbers of beggars go about seeking alms; and people
with passes from Glasgow (often forged) are numerous and trouble-
some. Of late, many little children, from six to twelve years of
age, are permitted. to beg from door to door. Something ought
to be done, for the sake of these poor creatures themselves, to put
down this practice; as it is well known that their parents are often
able enough to work, and do work, but take this cheap mode of sup-
porting their miserable offspring.
	Prison.--The old prison in Hamilton was built in the reign
of Charles I., and, although a handsome btilding in its day, bas
now gone much into disrepair. It has been bought up, and will
soon all be removed, except the steeple, town clock, and bell.
As this is the place of confinement for the delinquents of the
Middle Ward, it may not he uninteresting to show the number of
debtors and criminals confined here for the last twelve years. Be-
sides the following, it ought, however, to be recollected, that many
prisoners from this ward are taken to Glasgow.

	It would appear that criminals are on the increase and debtors
on the decrease.
	Fairs.--Hamilton in former times was a great mart for lint and
Wool, and was attended by persons from all parts of the country. At
present, however, that trade has taken a different channel, and only
a small quantity of lint (and no wool) is now sold here. Our fairs
have in consequence dwindled into a mere shadow of what they
once were, and at present are little better than larger market days.
Them are five principal fairs in the year.
