   Manufactures and Trade.-The principal manufacture is
weaving.  No woollen cloth indeed is wrought, but for a
partial supply to the lower ranks of people.  Linen and
checks are the great articles.  Almost every weaver, and
a good number of others, have their bleaching ground,
where they prepare linen, from the value of 9 d. to 4 s.
the yard.  Those who can afford to purchase yarn, work
check and green linen, which they fell in Dysart, Kirkaldy,
Cupar, and Dundee.  Others, of less stock, are employed
in these branches by manufactures in the above towns.
The greatest proportion of flax is imported; much of it is
dressed and spun in the parish.  A woman commonly
spins 2 hanks a-day, and she is paid from 1 s. to 1 s. 2 d.
the spindle.-The farmers deal considerably in cattle, which
go to the shambles in the surrounding country, and not a
few to Edinburgh; the remainder are bought for the most
part by English drovers.  Wheat, barley, oats, beans, and
sometimes potatoes, are shipped for Leith and the West
country; salt, for Dundee and Perth.  Wood and iron
are imported from Norway.  There are 3 corn-mills,
having thirlage; 2 barley, and 3 lint mills; 2 salt-pans,
supplied with coals from the distance of 4 miles.
