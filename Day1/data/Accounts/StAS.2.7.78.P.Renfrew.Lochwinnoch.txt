for years past, carefully marked every day, the height of the ther-
mometer and barometer morning and evening; and the water re-
ceived by two rain-guages; the direction in which the wind blows,
and the state of the weather. From this meteorological journal
I subjoin the following extracts and calculations:

    From the two rain-guages already mentioned, very different re-
sults are obtained. I have made my calculations from the one
which stands nearest the surface of the earth, and which receives
more rain than the other, which, by its elevation, is more exposed
to the wind, and, therefore, I apprehend, does not give so fair a
result.

<TABLE>
           In 1827, there fell during the whole year, 46.86 inches.

              1830,     -     -     -       -    -       55.51

    To mark the difference of the two guages, and to shew the at-
tention which should be paid to the situation of such instruments,
I may mention, that the quantity of rain received by the other in
1830 was only 43.95. I believe this is also an inferior instrument
to the other. It is obvious, therefore, that, if I had made my cal-

<FOOTNOTE>I have seen similar statements made in the Isle of Man and at Aberdeen, during
these two years, which it may be interesting and useful to contrast with the one just
now given.
