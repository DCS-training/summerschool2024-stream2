     Statistical Account

Anstruther was erected into a separate charge, and a church
built.  The stipend arises from the tithes of the fish, a grant
from his Majesty of part of the bishops rents, and some
money mortified for that purpose, and may be reckoned
between L. 70 and L. 80.  Sir John Anstruther is the
patron.

   Population.-In 1744, the number was 1000; in I764,
it was 900; at present, it is supposed rather above 1000.
The average of births 36; deaths 24.

   Port, Shipping, etc.-In 1710, Anstruther, which for-
merly was a creek of the customhouse of Kirkcaldy, was
made a port, and a customhouse established.
   In 1753, a new key was built; and to defray the ex-
pence an act of Parliament was procured, laying a tax of
two pennies Scots upon every pint of ale brewed or sold in
the burgh.  For some years of late the produce has not
been more than a third of what it was at the beginning.
   In 1768, the tonnage belonging to Anstruther Easter was
80 ton; it is now 1400.
   Ship-building has been carried on for some years to a
considerable extent.-There is a thread-manufacture.

   Poor.-The poor are supported by the weekly collec-
tions; besides which the shipmasters have a large fund, from
which they are able to make a decent provision for the
widows and orphans of their Society.  The trades have a
fund for their poor.

   Longevity.-In 1761, Robert Arnot, blacksmith, died,
aged 99 years and some months; Mr James Nairne, late
minister, 92; his son, the present incumbent, is 84.
