     Of Kirriemuir.

   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the num-
ber of souls then, was 3409.  At present they amount to be-
tween 4000 and 5000.  Males born in 1792, 68, females 70,
marriages 43.

   Ecclesiastical State, Stipend, Schools, Poor, etc-It appears
that there were once 4 religious houses in the parish, besides
the one presently used as a parish church, and the chapel in
Glenprosen, where the minister still officiates 2 or 3 times a-
year*.

20 minutes, a web of birdy, consisting of 91 yards, for working which 8 s. was
then paid.  This has greatly raised the price of all kinds of labour.  In 1786,
the wages of a labouring man servant were from 5 L. to 7 L.; of a woman from
2 L. 10 s. to 3 L.; of a mason from 15 d. to 18 d. a-day; of a joiner from 12 d. to
15 d.  At present, 1792, they are as follows:  of a man servant, from 7 L. to 10 L.
of a woman, from 3 L. to 4 L. 4 s.; of a mason, from 20 d. to 24 d. a-day; of 2
joiner, from 15 d. to 18 d.  All kinds of provisions have likewise risen in pro-
portion; if we abstract from the quality, which has been much improved since
the above period.  Beef, mutton, and lamb, sell at from 3 d. to 4 1/2 d. the pound;
veal at 2 1/2 d. to 4 d.; honey at 6 d. to 12 d. the pound, Dutch weight; fowls  at
9 d. to 14 d.; eggs at 3 d. to 4 d. a dozen, butter at 9 d. to 11 d. the pound of
27 oz., cheese at 6 s. to 5 s. the stone, of 27 English pounds.  The price of vic-
tual is very much regulated by the market at Dundee.  Oatmeal and barley
are, at a medium, about 14 s. the boll.

*One at a place called Chapeltown, about 3 miles to the N. of the town;
one at Killhill, about 3 miles to the E. of it; one near Balinshoe; and one in
Kirriemuir.  It is probable that the one near Balinshoe was built by the pro-
prietor, for the use of his own family; as the site of it is still enclosed with a
good wall, and used as the burying place of the Fletchers of Balinshoe.  Whe-
ther the others belonged to private families, or the parish in general, and when
any of them were used as places of public worship, is uncertain.  But the pro-
prietor of the site of the one in Kirriemuir is, to this day, called Sainty, and not
thirled to a mill in the neighbourhood, which is the case with every other pro-
prietor in the town; and a piece of ground adjoining, now used as a garden, is
in old wists called the Kirk-yard.
