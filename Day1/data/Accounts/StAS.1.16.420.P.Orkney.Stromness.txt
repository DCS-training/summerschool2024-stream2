   Manure.-In the upland farms, distant from the sea, the
only manure they have is the dung of their horses and cat-
tle, with feal and divot cut from the hill and brakes.
They build a spot of 10 or 12 feet in diameter with seals,
which they fill with dung, ashes, and cut seals.  These
compost dunghills are carried on the land in spring, spread,
and tilled down.

   Sea-weed.-In parts near the sea, they principally de-
pend on sea weed or ware, which, with some little dung
and house manure, raises excellent crops.  In some places
of the parish of Sandwick that lie in the vicinity of the
sea-shore, they put, in winter, sea-ware on their grounds;
in spring they put on the dung from the compost dung-
hills; and if plenty of sea-ware is drove ashore, they put
on sea-ware again, before they till and sow with bear.
The ground, thus thrice manured, produces a luxuriant
appearance of crop, and a good one if the season is dry;
but if the season is wet and rainy, it falls down before it is
filled, and then seldom ripens well.

   Marl.-In a few places marl is found.  It is taken up
in summer, and laid to dry.  Then it is laid on sea-grounds
and spread, and in harvest it is tilled down.

   Lime.-There is appearance of limestone in both these
parishes.  There is limestone in the parish of Sandwick,
which lies in the direction of from S. S. W. to N. N. E.;
