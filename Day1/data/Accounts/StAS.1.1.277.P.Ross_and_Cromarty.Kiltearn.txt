ment has been introduced, which deserves to be peculiarly
attended to, as it has answered all the good purposes that
were expected from it, viz.  The oxen are now harnessed
by many farmers in the same manner as horses, which they
work in the plough; the consequence is, that the animal
draws with more power, and also with more seeming ease to
itself, than when it was yoked by the neck.  And, to pre-
vent any inconveniency arising from the horns of the ox in
putting on the collar, there is a strap and buckle used, by
which the collar opens and shuts.  The prevailing opinion
seems to be in favour of labouring with oxen rather than
horses, which are liable to so many accidents, and a certain
loss in the end; but it has fared with this, as with many o-
ther just maxims, it is more readily assented to in speculation
than reduced to practice.  There are about 10 oxen wains
now in this parish, besides 30 coops or box carts, drawn by
two horses, employed by the proprietors and principal farm-
ers.  About twenty years ago, there were scarcely half that
number.  There are near 100 ploughs of all forts, but many
of them very light and trifling.  Besides the carts now men-
tioned, there are about 300 small rung carts, as they are
called, which are employed in leading home the fuel from
the moss, and the corn to the barn-yard.  These carts have,
instead of wheels, small solid circles of wood, between 20
and 24 inches diameter, called tumbling wheels.  It is also
very common to place a coarse, strong basket, formed like a
sugar loaf, across these small carts, in which the manure is
carried from the dung-hill to the field.  These kinds of carts
are called Kellachys; and are not only used in this district,
but over all the north country.  To form some idea of the
state of farming in this district, we subjoin the following ab-
stract of the manner in which the ground is laid down, toge-
