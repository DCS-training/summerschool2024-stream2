			PARISH OF MURROES.

	     PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

        	   THE REV. JOHN CURRIE, MINISTER.

                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
        Name, Boundaries, &c.-THIS parish was formerly called Muir-
house,-a name indicative, it should seem, of the waste and un-
cultivated state of a larger propotion of the land, in ancient times,
It is now universally known by the name of Murroes, which is
doubtless an abbreviation of Muirhouse.
	It is irregular in figure; 3 miles in length, and generally some-
what more than 2 miles in breadth. The parishes of Dundee
and Mains form its boundary on the south; Mains and Tealing,
on the west; Inverarity and Monikie, on the north; and Moni-
fieth, on the east.
        Topographical Appearances.-The land almost invariably as-
sumes an undulating appearance, and the acclivity, especially to-
wards the northern boundary, is not inconsiderable. The greater
part of the parish has a highly cultivated and pleasing aspect.
        Hydrography.-There are two rivulets connected with the pa-
rish, which joins the Dighty at no great distance from its influx
into the Tay. They serve to put in motion several thrashing and
corn-mills, and a small one erected some years ago for spinning
flax.
        Geology.-This parish possesses few `ttractions for the geolo-
gist. There is, it may be mentioned, a plentiful supply of excel-
lent freestone, of which the strata range nearly from east to west
and beds of whinstone rock or the trap family are extensively dif-
fused.-No plans of the rarer species have been noticed.
	There is no great diversity of soil. Back loam, incumbent
upon rock, gravel, or clay, predominates. A considareble portion
is deep, active, and fertile; the remainder is light, and much less
productive.
