     of Fraserburgh.

-Cod, ling, skate, turbot, whitings, haddocks, macka-
rel, lobsters, and many other kinds of fish, all of the best qua-
lity, and often in great quantities, are caught here in their sea-
sons. A great part of the cod and lobsters is bought up for the 
London market.-The Dutch are in the practice of fishing 
in summer on this coast; and in 1786, came so near as to 
preclude the inhabitants from their usual stations.  This 
practice has been long followed by them: and there is a tra-
dition that, in the beginning of the last century, their busses 
frequented the loch of Strathbeg, about half way between
Fraserburgh and Peterhead.  Strathbeg at present, has no
navigable communication with the sea, there being a bar of
sand and bent, nearly a mile in breath, between them; and
an English gentleman is now attempting to drain that loch.-
A rivulent, called the water of Philorth, separating the parish-
es of Fraserburgh and Rathen, a abounds with trout, especial-
ly that species called the phinnick, of a fine flavour.  A sal-
mon fishing has also been attempted at its mouth, and along
the bay, but has for some time been given up.

   Climate, Woods, Hills, etc.-The climate is dry; and so
healthy, that more than 20 persons are now living, above 80
years of age, and some above 90.  Continued great frosts are
rare.  Snow seldom falls before Christmas, and does not lie
long on the ground.-This parish appears to have a-
bounded with wood.  Large roots of trees, mostly oak, re-
main still in the mosses.  About Philorth house, the seat of
Lord Saltoun, is some old timber; and several plantations
have been lately made there.  His Lordship and other neigh-
bouring gentlemen, have also planted some hundreds of acres
of heath, or land, which produced poor crops of grain, with
various kinds of trees, which promise to be of great benefit,
as well as highly ornamental, to the country.-The on-
