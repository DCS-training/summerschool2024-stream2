     of Delting.

half of the year at least, a great part of the people are idle;
and during the other half, what little work they perform can
make no adequate return for their labour.  Nay, after all
their toil, they often do not receive the original value of the 
raw materials employed in their homely manufacture of single
stockings; which, however, is the only way by which many
of the inhabitants can earn a single penny.  It would be pre-

   The islands on the coast of this parish, and which form a
part of it, are, Mickle Rhoe, 24 miles in circumference, con-
taining 14 families, who live on a few spots which have been
brought under cultivation within these 40 or 50 years:  These

lies; Brother Isle, 2 families; Fishholm, 1 family.  These 3
islands are in Yell Sound, on the northern extremity of the
parish.  None of them would be inhabited but for the sake 
of the fisheries, as the little corn they produce is generally
blasted by the sea.  Bigga is another island in Yell Sound,
containing 4 families; half of it belongs to Delting, and half
to Yell.

in the parish, and these of a very singular construction.  They
are made of a small crooked piece of wood, at the end of 
which is fixed a slender pliable piece of oak, that is fastened
to the yokes laid across the necks of the oxen.  The man
