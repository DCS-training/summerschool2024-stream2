     of Assint.

   Coal and Fuel.-The height of this parish abounds with
limestone.  There is no saying but coals may be under it,
if the vast quantity of moor and moss above it may be
consumed.  It were to be wished that a trial was made, as
the drying and securing of fuel is*, for the most part, a
very troublesome and an expensive affair.  What are called
peats are only used here.

   The Rent of the Parish.-The old valued rent of this
parish is 4000 merks Scots, exclusive of the few salmon-
fishing rivers already mentioned.  The real present rent is
about L. 1000 Sterling.

   Iron Mines-Iron mines were dug here of old.  The
ore was also smelted in different places of this parish; but
the vast woods being consumed by Scandinavian invasions,
it was of course given up; but if coal were found, that
work might be still tried.  At Tubeg particularly, these
mines were dug, etc.; charcoal was plentifully got, the
bounds being one thick forest.  John Sinclair, still living,
found a piece of iron; it was of shape roundish; it was not
cast into bars them; it weighed from 17 to 20 pounds
weight.  This John Sinclair and his master caused the
smith to work it as (caibs) edgings for labouring imple-
ments.

   Marble.-There is plenty of marble at Ledbeg, Ry-an-
tra-id, and Ardvare, close by the Kilis, etc.

   State of the Church, etc. School.-The church and
manse had a very slight repair seven or eight years ago;
