peats to the inhabitants, and the other half a barren muir, of
much the same soil with that of the above-mentioned bank.
This plain is terminated on the N. by a range of low hills, cul-
tivated in most places half way up to the top; and, behind
these hills, a small part of the parish runs N. several miles, in
a narrow vale, which yields some corn, and affords good pas-
ture for sheep and black-cattle.

   Climate, Diseases, Fish, etc.-Within a mile of the shore,
which is sandy, the climate is often mild and temperate; while
the bank, and the whole tract of ground behind it, is cold and
covered with snow.  This, however, is only at intervals, in
the winter and spring seasons; for the difference of climate is
scarcely perceptible during the rest of the year; and it does
nor appear that it makes any material odds as to the health of
the inhabitants.  The air, upon the whole, being very saluori-
ous, the people in general enjoy good health; and there are
many influences of longevity in the parish.
   There are no rivers or fresh-water lakes in this parish, ex-
cepting the small river of Balnagown already-mentioned; in
which, at certain times of the year, large burn and sea trout
are found:  but, in good fishing-season, the parish is plentiful-
ly supplied with haddocks, cod, skate, sloundres, and cuddies,
from the Murray-Firth, carried here in baskets by the fishers
of Fearn and Nigg.  There is a bed of small cockles within
the bounds of the parish, which, in scarce years, has proved
very useful to the pooe people.  In 1782, 40 horse loads have
been taken out of it in one day.  When herrings appear on
the coast of Murray, they sometimes come in to the bay and
firth of Cromarty, and are killed opposite to this parish by the
inhabitants; though not in such quantities as to admit of ex-
portation.
