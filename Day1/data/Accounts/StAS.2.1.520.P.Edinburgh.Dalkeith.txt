<FOOTNOTE>It is stated by Dr M'Crie, that the part which relates to reptiles and insets was
published in 1624, under the name of 'Tomus secundus ;' but we have not succeeded
in finding a copy of it."-Life of Andrew Melville, Vol. ii. page 313-4. Edinburgh,
1819.

burgh, removed himself to Dalkeith, whither he had got a call ; which I mark as ex-
traordinary for to leive a better stipend for to goe to a much leaner,-their ware sun-
drie conjecture's about it. Some thought the 'Biscbop, was displeased with the free-
domes he sundrie tymes used.-Lord Fountainhall's Historical Observes, &c. 4to.
