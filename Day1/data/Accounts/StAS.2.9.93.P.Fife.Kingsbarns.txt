                          III.-POPULATION.

	  About a century ago the number of poor on the roll was seven.
	If these bore the same proportion to the population as the regu-
	lar poor do now, the number must have been doubled. But, from
	the change of habits in the people, and the gradual abolition of
	the high feelings of independence once so prevalent, this mode of
	judging cannot be correct. My predecessor, Mr Beatson, in his
	report states, that "at the time of Dr Webster's report, the num-
	bers were 871. From the last state of the roll the numbers
	amount to 807, of whom 467 reside in the village, and the. re-
	maining 340 inhabit the country part of the parish. For 30
	years the annual averages have been 16 deaths, 22 baptisms, and
	6 marriages." When the present incumbent took up his list of
	the population in 1811 the amount was 942,-629 in the village,
	and 313 in the country. In 1830 it was 1013,-581 in the for-
	mer, 432 in the latter. The census of 1831, which included all
	labourers within the bounds of each parish at the time, gives
	1023,-593 in the village, and 430 in the country. The propor-
	tion of males to females in both places is rather singular. In the
	village the former are to the latter as 249 to 344, while in the
	country they are as 214 to 216. The cause of the excess of fe-
	males in the village arises from the circumstance, that in the
	country there is seldom attached to the farm-steadings more houses
	than answer for the farm-servants and their families; hence wi-
	dows with children, and single women, seek a dwelling in the
	former. The general and progressive increase of the population
	is owing to the great improvement during the last fifty years in
	the science of agriculture, and to the extra and steady employ-
	ment which the enclosing, draining, and extensive cultivation of
	waste lands has given. The average of births during the last
	seven years has been 29 1/7, of deaths 14, and of marriages 8 8/7.
	  One Baronet, and a retired Judge of the Court of Session reside
	upon their estates.
	  During the last three years there have been 3 illegitimate births
	in the parish.
	  Character, &c. of the People.-The inhabitants are rather re-
	markable for height. When the local militia were embodied, a
	greater number of men in the grenadier company came from this
	parish than from any other in the eastern district of Fife.
	  Much improvement in the condition and comforts of the people
	has of late years taken place. An inclination to render their per-
