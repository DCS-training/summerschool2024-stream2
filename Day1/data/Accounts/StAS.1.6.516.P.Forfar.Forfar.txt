   About and before the year 1745 there were few private houses
covered with state, and the masonry of almost all of them was
of a very inferior kind; since that time almost every new house
has been covered with states of a coarse kind, of which there
are plenty in quarries within the royalty, and several of the
principal ones with Easdale.  A thatched house is scarcely to be
seen, and the masonry of such houses as have been built of late
years is neat are substantial; the inhabitants appearing to have
caught a new taste in building from the pattern set them in
the new Town-house and new Church, which are of neat mo-
dern architecture.

   Like most towns in Scotland, Forfar had been built without
any regular design, as every man's fancy dictated the situation
of his house; now more attention is bestowed in regulating the
streets in the extended parts of the town, as well as in remov-
ing irregularities in rebuilding houses in the old-street.-There
are no uninabited houses, new ones are extending the town 
in almost every direction, and house rents are rather on the use.
Most of the houses built for trades-people consist of two stories,
having four apartments of about 16 feet square each, one of
which, with a portion of the garret, is sufficient to accommo-
date a weaver with his loom, his furniture and his fuel, and
he pays for it, and a few feet of garden ground, from 20 s. to
45 s. per annum, according to its distance from the market place
or its other advantages or disadvantages.  The weaver gene-
ally prefers the low flat for his operations, and an open expo-
sure, if possible, to the heart of the town*.

*About 50 or 60 years ago there were not above 7 tea-kettles, as many
hand-bellows, and as many watches in Forfar:  now tea-kettles and hand-
bellows at the necessary furniture of the poorest house in the parish, and al-
most the meanest methal servant must have his watch.
