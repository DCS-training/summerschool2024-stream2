sum be now increased to 80 L. Sterling, yet the interest of it
is far from being sufficient to support an established school-
master.  Among the disadvantages peculiar to Megget, its
great distance from Lyne church, which is about 14 miles,
ought not to be omitted.  The river Tweed runs between
them, and the road is remarkably bad and steep.

   Means of Melioration.-As Megget is sometimes almost
inaccessible during 2 or 3 months in winter, on account of
the steep hills and rough roads, nothing would tend more to
promote the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants, than
a passable road up Manor water.  If it were carried up the
narrow glen opposite to Manor-head, which is practicable,
and afterward down Glengaber water, great part of the pre-
sent steep pull would be saved, and the traveller would de-
rive essential benefit from it.  It is true, that the expense
would be considerable, but the sum which was lately expend-
ed in obtaining an act of parliament for making road in the
county, would have been sufficient for making that road.
It is certainly very hard, especially on poor counties, when
they are obliged to spend about 400 L. Sterling, in order to
obtain leave to lay out their own money in the way they
think best.  The writer of this has no object in view, but
the good of his country; and it will be admitted, that few
things are more conducive to its improvement, than good
roads upon a liberal plan, and in a proper direction.  As this
is a national concern, and not confined to any particular dis-
trict, it is to be hoped, that at some future period it may meet
with all the attention it deserves.
   That considerable improvement has been lately made on
the roads, cannot be denied; but it will also be admitted,
that they are farm from having attained that perfection, either
in the direction or execution of them, to which they may be
