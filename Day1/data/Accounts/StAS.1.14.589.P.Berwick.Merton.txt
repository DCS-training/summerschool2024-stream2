all inhabited; and some of these say, that they have heard
their fathers mention double that number; and indeed this
tradition seems to be well founded, as the ruins of several
houses are still visible.  The third, which was nearly equal
to the second, is so mutilated, that scarcely a tenth part re-
mains.  The fourth hath not suffered so essentially, though
the blank is too perspicuous not to be observed.  At the
same time, it is certain, that the return to Dr. Webster in
1755 is stated only at 502 souls, consequently there is a
difference of 55 in favour of the population at present.
