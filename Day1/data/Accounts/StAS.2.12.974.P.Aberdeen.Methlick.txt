for teaching ten poor children, L.8; total L. 116 ; also a house
with the legal accommodation, and an enclosed garden.
   Besides the parochial school, there are three adventure or un-
endowed schools, where the ordinary branches of education are
taught.  At Cairnorie, about three miles distant from the parochial
school, the Earl of Aberdeen has just erected a neat and commo-
dious school, which it is intended to place on the establishment.
This institution will prove a welcome boon to the inhabitants of
the district, while one of the adventure schools in its immediate
neighbourhood will be superseded.  At Inverebrie, on the very
verge of the parish, and nearly six miles distant from the church,
there is another school, the teacher of which receives an annual
gratuity from the Noble proprietor.
   In 1841, a parish library was instituted for the purpose of
affording instructive and religious reading to the parishioners.
There are about 80 subscribers, and nearly 400 volumes.
   There is one Sabbath school in the parish, which is superin-
tended by the teacher of the school at Throopmuir; and a Bible
class, numerously attended, is taught by the minister in the church
every Sabbath day.
   Friendly Societies.-The only Friendly Society which exists here,
and which remodelled its rules agreeably to the Act of Parliament,
is called the Methlick Wright's Friendly Society.  In its mem-
bership, it is not confined to wrights, but admits all tradesmen and
others who wish, by paying a small sum quarterly, to share in the
advantages which it holds forth:
   Savings Bank.-A District Savings' Bank, on the security of
the National funds, was opened in Ellon at Martinmas 1839,
and the industrious classes in this and the other parishes of the
Presbytery, with the exception of Cruden, already supplied with
an institution of a similar description, have gladly availed them-
selves of the means of providing for the wants of age.  At Meth-
lick, the deposits from 25th November 1839 to 20th November
1840 amounted to L.353; the sum withdrawn between these dates
was L.1 ; and the interest payable at 20th November 1840 was
L.6, 3s.  The deposits from 20th November 1840 to 20th No-
vember 1841 amounted to L.361 ; the sum withdrawn during that
period was L.53, 12s. 8d.; and the interest payable at 20th No-
vember 1841 was L.18, 13s. 3d.  At 20th November 1841, there
were at Methlick fifty depositors, and the sum deposited was
L. 684.
