Eying askance her young ones on the grass,
Lest they too near approach the river's bank:
The cattle spread around now browse the herbs,
Loaded with dews delightful to the taste.
The watchful dog guards well the ripened corns,
And saves the treasure for his master's use.
Near this a pleasing riv'let glides along,
Falls from the height, and forms the bright cascade,
Where hollow rocks surround the foaming pool,
And form a shade to screen the mid-day sun.-
From this we mount the bank to view the Lake,
With shining surface drawn from chrystal springs,
Land locked and smooth, where oft the finny tribe
Rise at the glittering fly with eager haste.-
We now return and trace the river's banks,
Studded with cowslips, and with copsewoods crowned.
Beyond, the prospect's barren all and wild,
With hollow glens and deep sequestered lawns.
Now all at once, far up another glen,
Midst awful solitudes and darksome dells,
A high tremenduous rock erects his front:
On near approach we found it deeply mark'd,
With venerable names of there who fled,
In Charles's hapless days, the haunts of men,
Pursued by unrelenting bands who sought
Their death, and waged ignoble war.
Here sad the preacher stood with solemn pause,
To mark, with outstretched arm, the sombre heath,
The field of scottish and of english wars;
Or what more near concerned the listening croud,
To point the fatal spot on Pentland Hills,
Where many a ploughman warrior fought and fell.-
Slowly we turn and leave these gloomy scenes,
