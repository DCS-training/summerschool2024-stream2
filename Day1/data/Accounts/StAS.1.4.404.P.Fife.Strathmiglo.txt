     Statistical Account

No manufactures are carried on, except by individuals.
They are not fond of a seafaring or military life.  Property,
particularly in land, does not often change.  It fells, at an
average, at about 26 years purchase.  The people are as
much disposed to humane and generous actions, as others
in their circumstances generally are.  On the whole, they
enjoy the comforts and advantages of society, and seem con-
tented.-  The country roads and bridges are in tolerable good
order, and are kept in repair by assessments in money and
statute-labour, exacted in kind.  There are no turnpikes.
The general opinion is, that if the money raised by them
is properly applied, it is the only effectual way to make
good roads and bridges, and keep them in proper repair.-
The farms in general may be at an average of about 150
acres, and the average rent about 10 s. an acre.  The num-
ber of farms is diminishing rather than increasing.-  The
manners of the inhabitants are much the same they were
36 years ago, civil and obliging; but their dress and style
of living are very different.  At that time, though the
rents the farmers paid were very low, they and their fa-
milies were in general coarsely clad, and lived in a mean
style; but now that the rents are greatly raised, in some
places of the parish doubled, and in one farm almost tripled,
the farmers are in appearance richer, and their families
dress and live much better.
