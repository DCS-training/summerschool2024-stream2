he gave to this and some of the neighbouring parishes, no
body suffered for want; but their circumstances were much
impaired; there was no demand for cattle.  Meal was sold
at 1 s. 6 d. and 2 s. per peck, 9 lib.  Servants suffered most
for every body reduced their numbers; and day-labourers
got little if any employment.
   So early as the 15th September 1782, there was a great
fall of snow, which laid all the corns, then hardly begun to
fill, in most places.  The frosts were often intense, and vege-
tation was stopt here.
   The corns which had milky juices in the ear were totally
ruined; those which had only watery juices wanted season;
there were none of them perfectly full or ripe.  They were
therefore given mostly unthreshed to the cattle.  It was after
Christmas before they were all cut.  The meal made of what
was threshed was bad.  To some it may appear trivial, to
others worthy to be remarked, that, in spring 1783, cows
had calves much earlier, and in greater numbers, than was
ever remembered; a fortunate circumstance, in a year when
the victual of home produce was excessive]y bad, and in a
place where milk is a constituent part of ordinary fare.  It
was observed, too, very truly, as to this parish, that there
was less sickness that year than usual; a fact which the curi-
ous will, no doubt, trace up to several causes.
