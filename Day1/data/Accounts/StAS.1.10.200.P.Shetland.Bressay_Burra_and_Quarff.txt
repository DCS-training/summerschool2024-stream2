English miles distant from one another.  The one is in Bres-
say, very near the manse; the other is in Burra.  Neither of
them is in good order.  The kirk of Burra is very antient,
and has a large steeple; it seems to have been a Popish cha-
pel.  The heritors are 9 in number; but the greatest part of
these have very small property in the ministry.  Sir Thomas
Dundas is patron.  The present incumbent is Mr John
Menzies, a bachelor, who was settled in May 1792.  There
is an established school in there parishes; and application has
been made to the Society for propagating Christian Know-
ledge for a charity school to Burra and Quarff, which has
been granted, though not yet erected.  It is much to be la-
mented, that the education of youth is not more attended to
in this country.  The people discover a quickness of appre-
hension, and an aptness to learn, which deserve to be en-
couraged.  Many of the young men go abroad, and such of
them as have got a decent education, rise to preserment.
The poor of Bressay have funds distinct from those of Burra
and Quarff.  These are managed by the different sessions.
To the former belong the interest of 150 L. Scots, and the
rent of 4 merks land, mortified by Mr William Humphry,
formerly minister of there parishes.  The latter have the in-
terest of 20 l. Sterling, and the rents of 8 merks land, morti-
fied by the same gentleman.  These, with the collections,
which are very small, afford them a scanty allowance*.
