   Manufactures-At present the leading feature of this pa-
rish is its manufactures:  Two very extensive printfields
have been erected within these nine years; the one in the
1785, at the French mills, stiled the Kincaid printfield, the
firm, Henderson, Semple and Company, upon a farm which
they have rented from the laird of Kincaid, at three pound
per acre:  They have constructed not only the most elegant
machinery for the calico printfield; but have likewise com-
pleted a set of works for the manufacturing all sorts of grain;
the fall at this printfield is 22 feet; the grounds are laid
out with great taste; and in order to obtain soft pure water,
they have dug a reservoir of 120 yards in length, and seven-
ty in breadth, with a small island in the middle, planted
with shrubs.
   The other was erected in the year 1786, containing a farm
annexed to it of about thirty acres; likewise at three pound
per acre, where works uncommonly commodious have been
erected:  The firm of this second, is Lindsay, Smith and
Company; both fields are upon a lease of 99 years.
   Both these works have been carried on with spirit, and, it
is believed, with considerable success.  Two circumstances
induced the manufacturers to settle in this parish; viz. plen-
ty of pit-coal, and the uncommon supply of water in all sea-
sons; perhaps the circumstances of being situated in the neigh-
bourhood of Glasgow, and of the Canal, might not a little
contribute to fix their choice.  There are about 306 persons,
young and old, employed at each field; each employs 37
tables for block printing, and 17 copperplate presses; they
in general bleach their own cloth for printing.
   At the Lennox mill print-field, there is another field laid out
for bleaching lawns, which there is every reason to believe will
succeed perfectly well.  The work people at the Wester
