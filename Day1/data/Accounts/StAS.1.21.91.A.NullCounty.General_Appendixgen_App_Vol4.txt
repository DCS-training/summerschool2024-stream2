follow their leader, Sir James Grant, wherever the enemy dare
to trample on Scottish ground.
   His Majesty has not more zealous; faithful or loyal sub-
jects, than 'the sober-minded' Highlanders, throughout the
whole of the vast extent of country they possess. At a dis-
tance from nurseries of vice, and fashionable, but destructive
luxuries of life; prosperous and happy under indulgent mas-
ters; sensible of the privileges they enjoy under a mild go-
vernment;-they are eager to defend and preserve these in-
valuable blessings.  Of the disaffection and disloyalty of some
individuals southward, they talk with detestation.  Of French
fraternity and equalization, they express themselves with hor-
ror, as a measure under which society could not subsist.  Not
from individuals only, but from many of the inhabitants of
the parish of Duthil and Rothiemurchus, has the writer of
this article heard, with much satisfaction, the following just
and proper idea, cloathed in the forcible language of a saga-
cious Highlander:-'That, from the Almighty, to the low-
'est reptile, a regular chain of subordination exists; and
'praying God to preserve that chain, and prevent horror
'and confusion; and for that valuable purpose, to bless and
'counsel the judges of the land to administer justice and equi-
'ty betwixt man and man.'

   Woods.-A considerable extent of ground in this parish
lies under aller wood, the most useless for manufacture, and
yet occupies the most fertile soil.  How preferable would it
be, how pleasing to the eye, how much more profitable to
proprietors and tenants, to see fields of corn and flax al-
ternately in its stead, surrounded with rows of beech, elm,
etc.!  The present proprietor of Rothiemurchus has the
merit of introducing this piece of improvement, among ma-
ny others; into his property.
