     Statistical Account

   Roads, Briges, and Post-office.-The roads are, in ge-
neral, in very bad repair; partly owing to the wetness and
depth of the soil; partly to the injudicious and imperfect
mode of repair, and partly to the statute labour not being
regularly exacted, by which the roads in this corner were
originally made, and which is the only means of their sup-
port.  Within these few years, Lord Findlater's factor in
that district, has exerted himself in a very laudable manner
to remedy that defect; has introduced a more judicious and
perfect mode of repair, and is more regular and strict in ex-
acting the statute labour; for which, though the inhabitants
in the mean time, murmur a little, he deserves their best
thanks; and were his commendable zeal properly seconded,
by the other heritors and factors, the complaint of bad roads
in Keith would soon be no more heard of.  The parish is to-
lerably supplied in bridges, mostly new and in good repair.
In the new village there is a Post-office, to which the letters
are brought by runners from Fochabers thrice a week;-
an office, which, from its increasing consequence, ought to
be more liberally supported and supplied with runners.  It
ought to have at least 6 instead of 3.  Without this increase
of runners, it can never properly answer the purpose; for
when there is a necessity of answering any letter in course

ed, and finding no support from session, presbytery, or public funds of
the church, and perhaps a little softened by the promise of a living in the
church, from the laird of Braco, now become Lord Braco, he was indu-
ced the consent to a compromise.  By that compromise, the mortified lands
were valued, and found to be worth 300 merks of rent annually.  This
sum, Lord Braco engaged to pay to the schoolmaster and his successors
in office, annually, in all time coming, upon condition of his being allow-
ed to retain the lands.  The compromise was afterwards ratified, by the
presbytery of Strathbogies, and the Synod of Murray.
