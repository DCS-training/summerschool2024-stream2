           The Moncrieffe, garden contains many rare plants, such as
        heaths, Pelargoniums, and other natives of the Cape of Good
        Hope; also a considerable number from New South, Wales and
        other regions.
           Trees.- Till about eighty years ago, scarcely any trees grew in
        Strathearn, except a few sprinkled around gentlemen's seats.
        The whole valley is now studded with plantations; one effect of
        which, according to the testimony of old people, has been to abate
        very sensibly the violence of the blasts.
           About forty years ago, Moncrieffe hill was overgrown with freeze
        and broom; it is now covered with thriving wood of various sores.
        Around the house are some very fine trees: horse chestnuts,
        measuring eighteen feet round the stem; walnuts, twelve; ashes,
        ten; and a willow, planted some years ago, is above ten feet in
        circumference. The number of acres in the parish under wood
        is 4l9.  In the management of trees there is a great improvement
        in the parish in comparison of former time.  The trees which
        have been planted in the grounds of Moncrieffe are, oak, ash, elm,
        birch, beech, Spanish chestnut, silver and spruce-firs; and larch
        and Scotch firs are used for nurses; but when it is intended to
        embellish any Portion of the grounds, without reference to the
        profit to be ultimately derived from the wood, horse chesnut,
        lime, plane, and walnut, are interspersed amongst the former va-
        rieties.
