the Tervay, Crombie, and smaller streams; cross roads in all di-
reactions, and a main one from Tomnavoulen to Achnara, round the
country called Braes of Glenlivet, (which is utterly destitute of roads,)
with a branch from Tomalinan to Tamintoul, and another, if practi-
cable, to Glenbucket or Strathdon,--the present thoroughfare to the
latter being only a pass so steep as to have obtained the very ap-
propriate name of the Ladder. The much-talked-of line of road
(which is nearly complete in this parish) from Perth to Elgin and
Forres, with a bridge over the Spey at Tomdow, would also be
highly beneficial to the parish. But the improvement which, above
all others, is most to be desired, is the erection of a parish in the
country of Glenlivet, which would be felt as a mighty boon by the
Protestants, and which could not fail to be of great benefit to all
the people. The conflicting nature of religious profession there
is an evil whose consequences are deeply felt; and dram-drink-
ing and illegitimate births, though both considerably on the decrease,
are still to frequent. Yet, with the machinery of a parish under
the guidance of a faithful and judicious clergyman, in the full en-
joyment of the status and emoluments of a parish minister,--it
might be hoped that, under the Divine blessing, the whole inhabi-
tants of Glenlivet, disposed as they are, readily to avail themselves
of the means of religious and moral instruction, which they enjoy,
would gradually be improved; and that this beautiful and sequester-
ed country would ere long become, what nature seems to have in-
tended it to be, the enviable abode of religion, of happiness, and
of virtue.
