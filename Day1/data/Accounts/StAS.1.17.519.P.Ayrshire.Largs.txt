     of Larges.

   This fair is famous over the west of Scotland, and con-
tinues from Monday to Thursday.  Great numbers of peoples
from 40 or 50 miles round, resort to it, some for business,
and some for pleasure.  Upwards of 100 boats are often to
be seen, on this occasion, riding in the Bay.
   The whole week is a kind of jubilee to the inhabitants,
and a scene of diversion to others.
   Such a vast multitude cannot be accommodated with
beds; and the Highlanders, in particular, do not seem to
think such accommodation necessary.  They spend the whole
night in rustic sports, carouting and dancing on the green
to the found of the bagpipe.  Every one who chooses is al-
lowed to join in this, which forms their principal amusement.
   The candidates for the dance are generally so numerous,
that it is kept up without intermission during the whole time
of the fair.
   This was formerly the general meeting place of Highlanders
and Lowlanders, for the purpose of exchanging the commo-
dities which each of them could spare for others of greatest
utility.
   Since shops have been opened, and pedlars have visited
the different islands, this fair has gradually decreased; it is
still, however, better frequented than any in the country.
Few scenes can afford objetects more worthy of attention to
the philosopher, who wishes to contemplate human nature
it its simplest and most undisguised forms, or to the benevo-
lent man, who rejoices to see that a great part of human
happiness belongs to the virtuous poor.

   Conclusion.-Fairley road is one of the most convenient in
the Frith of Clyde.  Vessels of any burthen may ride in it at
all seasons, and loose from it with any wind.
