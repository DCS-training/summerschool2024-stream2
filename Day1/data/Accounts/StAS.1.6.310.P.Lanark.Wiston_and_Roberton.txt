about 12 s. a year.

   Ecclesiastical State and Schools.-There are only a very few
dissenters from the Established church in the parish.-The
Crown was patron of Wistoun, the family of Douglas of Ro-
bertoun.  When the parishes were united, it was settled that
the right of patronage should be alternate, the Crown having
the first turn.
   The schools remain as before the parishes were united, there
being one with the legal salary in each of the former parishes.

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-The high and well known hill of
Tinto stands on the borders of this parish.-Dun-gavel, a de-
tached beautiful green hill, stands betwixt Wistoun and Ro-
bertoun.  A water spout broke upon it, August 2 d, 1786*.
-There are good trout in the Clyde, as also in two small rivers,
the one running through Robertoun, the other by Wistoun.-
The great road from Carlisle to Glasgow, by Moffat, passes thro'
the head of this parish.  There is a pretty good road across the
parish, made sometime ago by statute-labour, to give access to
coal.  The other roads here are very bad.-The greater part
of the people live in scattered villages, none of which are large.
Robertoun contains above 30 families;-Wistoun about 30;-
and New-town of Wistoun much the same: besides these there
are several smaller villages, of about 8, 9, or 10 families each.
