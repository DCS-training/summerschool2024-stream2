necessary to a bare subsistence.  The farmers form the most
industrious, sober, and useful class of men, and deserve more
than any other liberal encouragement.

   Mode of Farming, etc.-Though the farmers in this parish
have, of late years, made considerable improvement in the
knowledge and practice of agriculture, they still adhere pret-
ty much to the old method; the stubborn nature of the soil,
they say, and probably with truth, does not wholly admit of
the new.
   The crops are wheat, oats, barley, pease, beans, potatoes,
turnip, flax, and clover and rye-grass.  Of wheat, very little
is now sown, a succession of unfavourable seasons having dis-
couraged the culture of it.  Pease, beans, flax, and turnip,
are also sown in but small quantities.  The principal crops
are oats, barley, potatoes, and clover and rye-grass.
   Till lately, very little land, except for fallow, was plowed
before the month of January.  It is a general opinion among
the farmers here, that, unless the soil be dry, and free from
tough-rooted weeds, winter plowing is prejudicial to the
crop, wet clay land being apt to cake even after frost, and
tough or dry-rooted weeds, which are not easily destroyed by
frost, sprouting before the corn is sown, and therefore cho-
king it the more readily after it is come up.  They begin
now, however, to give less weight to these objections.
   The greater part of the farmers plow with three horses,
some with four, and but very few with two only.
   The usual time of sowing wheat is October; oats, pease,
and beans, from the beginning of March to the end of April;
and barley, clover, and rye-grass, from the beginning to the
middle of May.  Potatoes are planted about the middle of
April; in large fields with the plough, in small plots with
the dibble.
