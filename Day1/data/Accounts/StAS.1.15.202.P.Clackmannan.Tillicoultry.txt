warm, and dry.  The dysentery was unknown here for ma-
ny years.  It has, however, appeared of late three different
times, and carried off a good many persons, chiefly women.
As this alarming malady always broke out in the end of har-
vest, some have been apt to imagine, that, if it was not caught
by infection, it arose from the colds and damps to which
the people were exposed in reaping, or to a frequent use of
potatoes not brought to a proper state of maturity.  The
people have in general aversion to inoculation for the
small-pox, yet this prejudice is beginning to wear away++.

   Population.-Tillicoultry is a small parish, yet pretty popu-

++Many children took the small pox, last year, in the natural way, only
one of whom died, being a sickly child.  Were the small-pox to be always
equally favourable, inoculation would fall into disuse.  The author has some
times remarked, that when the same diseases, such as dysenteries, fevers, and
the small-pox, have prevailed in Alva and Tillcoultry, more in proportion
have died in Alva than here.  This was probably occasioned by the houses
being more crouded together in the one place than the other, and the air be-
ing more consined, and the infection more liable to spread.
