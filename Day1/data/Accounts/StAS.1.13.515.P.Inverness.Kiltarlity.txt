   Of wild animals, hares are very numerous, owing to
the abundance of cover they have among the woods, and in
the broom, with which shrubs the lower end of this parish
abounds.  We have also many foxes, otters, and polecats;
some mountain hares, and a few wild cats; the last are not
so numerous now as formerly.  The numerous of black cattle
in these united parishes may be about 3016.  They are of
various sizes, but in general somewhat larger than the old
highland breed.  Some of the proprietors, and a gentleman
farmer, have for some years past greatly improved their
breed of cattle.  Major Fraser of Belladrum is supposed to
have the best breed of cows in this country; though not
quite so large as the Fifeshire cattle, they are much hardier
and handsomer; and when sold, commonly fetch from L. 6
to L. 9 Sterling each cow.  The number of sheep may
be about 5226.  About 200 of these are of an excellent
breed from England; 400 or 500 more are considerably
larger than the common breed of this country:  the rest are
of the old Scotch sheep, small sized, with short wool.  The
number of goats is about 429.  There were formerly many
more sheep and goats in this parish than at present.  Since
the gentlemen have begun to enclose their grounds and to
plant, sheep and goats have in a great measure been banish-
ed from the lower end of the parish.  There may be about
719 horses of different sizes, but in general they are small.

   Population-The return to Dr Webster, between 40 and
50 years ago, was 1964 souls, 402 of whom were Papists.
By an exact survey in September 1793, the number of
souls in these united parishes was 2495:
