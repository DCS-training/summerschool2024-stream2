The rent of lands, in the lower parts of the parish, is from
10 s. to 15 s. per acre: the hill grounds, in general, are given
in addition.  But, in the higher part of the country, where
much attention is paid to sheep, a farm is rented by the lump.
-There are 17 heritors in the parish, of which number only
6 constantly reside in it.
   The principal crops are, oats, Chester-bear, pease, and po-
tatoes.  Much attention is paid to the raising of the latter: the
inhabitants sublift on them about 9 months in the year: and
not a little is employed in feeding cows, horses, and swine.
To this valuable root, and to the raising of flax, this country
is particulary indebted.  In general, all the farmers here raise
and spin what flax is sufficient to pay their money rents, be-
sides all their other smaller accounts.  There is probably 3000
stone of flax annually raised in the parish.  Turnips succeed
well here; and, within these few years, considerable progress
has been made in using them.  With a few exceptions, almost
every farmer, in the Appin district of the parish, allots a small
portion of his land to them: to this they are chiefly led by find-
ing that grass feeds thrive better after them than by any other
preparation of the ground.  The common way is to sow them
in drills, although it has also been found, that they answer ve-
ry well, in the broad cast method, for feeding sheep.  Some
experiments have been made in this neighbourhood to pasture
lambs upon them, during the months of October and Novem-
ber, as a preservative against the disease called the Braxy.  It
is uncertain whether the desired object is attained by turnips,
but this much is certain, that great advantage is gained by it.
Oats are sown from the 10th of April to the beginning of May;
and bear from the 15th of May to the 9th of June.
