with capstones.  In an old tack, this inclosure is called,
"The great deer park of Haliedean," and was once full of
wood; but it has long been subdivided, and all the trees
cut down, except a few old birches.
   Here, as well as in other parts of Scotland, many birch,
fir, and oak trees have been found in the mosses; some of
them 3 feet in diameter, and several of the firs and oaks
quite sound.  They generally lie from 3 to 8 feet below
the surface.  Human bones also, and many horns of diffe-
rent animals, have been dug up, quite beyond the size of
the largest to be any where seen at this time.  How the
former were laid there, and how the latter acquired their
enormous size, leaves room for conjecture.  Where they
are found, the substance of the moss is condensed fog, to ap-
pearance as fresh and distinct as that upon old lea ground.
This too may afford matter of curious speculation.
   The family of Carre of Cavers deserves also to be men-
tioned, as one of the most ancient in the S. of Scotland.
Their chief residence, for many generations, has been in
the parish.  George Carre, Esq; of Nisbet, a Lord of Ses-
sion, was descended from a branch of this family.  They
are supposed to have sprung from Kerr of Ferniherst.  One
of their ancestors claimed the title of Lord Jedburgh; but
from the different manner in which they spell their name,
it seems probable, either that they are a distinct family, or
a very old cadet.
