Master, was conferred only by the chancellor or vice-chancel-
lor.  The rcquisites to all the degrees was a certain time of
study, and the having heard certain books prelected upon,
and certain exercises and examinations: in Bachelors of the
Arts 15 years of age, and in Masters 20.  It was forbidden,
under a heavy penalty, to give any man the title of Master,
by word or writing, who had not attained that degree; and
the penalty was still more heavy if any man took it to him-
self before he had lawfully obtained it.-Academical degrees
were considered as of divine institution, (probably because in-
stituted by Popes, who were thought to be inspired by the
Holy Ghost); and, therefore, the chancellor or vice-chancel-
lor conferred them authorirate divina, et in nomine Patris, Fi-
lii, et Spiritus Sancti.

   IV. Teaching.-The last division we shall mention, is into
teachers, and those who were taught.-On this part of the con-
stitution the records, that are extant, leave us much in the
dark.  We knew that four faculties were established; because,
in the oath taken by masters of arts, they swore to promote
peace among the four faculties, especially with the faculty of
theology.  A school of canon law is mentioned as being in
disrepair, and to be repaired out of the university purse; and
it appears that degrees were conferred both in that faculty
and in theology.-ANDREAS DE GARLIES, Doctor in Me.
dicinis, was incorporated in 1469; but his name is never
mentioned again, nor any thing else that relates to medicine.
It is probable, therefore, that there was no faculty of medi-
cine, nor any teaching in that science.-Of the teaching in
the faculty of arts we have more full information, from two
manuscripts in parchment;-one of which contains the sta-
tutes of that faculty, and its conclusions; and the other the
minutes of its meetings, and transactions, from 1451 to 1509,
