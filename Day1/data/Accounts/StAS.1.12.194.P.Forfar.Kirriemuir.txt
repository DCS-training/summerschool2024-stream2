loaded with the produce, or manufactures of the district, and
bring from thence flax, sugar, tea, porter, rum, and all kinds
of merchant goods; and two come twice a-week from Mon-
trose.  And it is to be observed, that these carriers seldom
bring coals.  The town is supplied with that article by Dun-
dee carriers, or the farmers in the neighbourhood*.  Two
annual fairs are held here, in July and October, for sheep,
horses, and black cattle; and fox flax, wool, labouring uten-
sils, and household necessaries.  It contains 492 houses, 471
families, 10 brewers, who are likewise innkeepers, 12 retail-
ers of foreign spirits, 3 of wine, about 20 of ale and whisky,
27 merchants, 228 weavers, and 1584 souls.
   Two tan-yards have been established here for some time,
and a third is erecting.  A distillery was begun some months
ago, in a situation than which none could be better adapted for
the purpose; and in building the houses necessary for it, the
proprietor had in view the establishment of a brewery at the
same place, should a proper person be found to undertake it.
About 1200 pair of shoes are made annually for exportation;
and the manufacture of coarse linen is carried on to a very
great extent.  Osnaburgh, serim, and birdy, to the amount of
about 38,000 L. Sterling, were manufactured from September
1791 to September 1792.  This is more than was ever be-
fore manufactured in one year, and must have been owing to
the flourishing state of the trade, which was never better than
it is at present, December 1792+.
