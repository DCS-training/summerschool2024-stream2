   Horses, Black Cattle, etc.-The horses in this district, and
through Orkney in general, are of a hardy nature and small
size, the largest are seldom above 14 hands high; great num-

the tenant of said lands (without any interference of the proprietor,) until
the last general election of members of Parliament, when the election for
the county of Orkney happened, (unfortunately for a great number of the
inhabitants of this island,) to be disputed; for in consequence thereof, such
tenants of the successful candidate, as live in this island, and the tenants of
his political friends, by the express order of the proprietor of Rothesholm to
his tenant, were strictly prohibited from casting in, and leading peats from
his mosses on any terms whatever.  These tenants, when laid under this in-
tolerable hardship, conscious that they had not done any thing to merit this
gentleman's displeasure, thought it exceedingly hard, and even unjust, that they
should be so severely punished for offences of which they were not guilty;
did venture, notwithstanding the foresaid order and prohibition, after pre-
viously having made offer to the tenant of Rothesholm of the usual acknow-
gements, to persist in their possession of the said mosses, by casting, winning,
and leading peats for the use of their families, according to custom, and an-
cient practice.  But this conduct of these tenants occasioned a law suit before
the Court of Session, which was lately decided in favours of the proprietor
of the moss, at whose instance it had been raised.
   This restriction and decision, will soon be found a great cause of diminish-
ing the inhabitants of this island, as the tenants above mentioned, and their
cottars, cannot live without such a necessary article as fire; and their circum-
stances in general, are not such as to enable them to purchase and carry coals
from England or from the Frith of Forth, to supply their families, and the
families of their sub-tenants and cottars, with firing.
   Moreover, an improper practice hath crept into this district, of not only
increasing the wages of unmarried men servants and boys, employed in farm
work, to more than three times the amount of what they were satisfied with
about thirty years ago; but certain portions of land have been given to many
of them by their masters, from which they have reaped crops of victual,
which they have sold for several years past, after defraying the expence of
labour, at such sums, as, with other wages and perquisites, received by them
annually from their masters, hath arisen to, and in some instances exceeded
