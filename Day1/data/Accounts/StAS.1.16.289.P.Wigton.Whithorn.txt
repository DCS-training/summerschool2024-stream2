     of Whithorn.

   She left two sons, one of them a present magistrate in
the burgh, and two daughters.  Upon enquiry, I have
found that Mrs Macmillan was blessed with a good natural
temper, and was always the friend of peace; that the en-
joyed an easy and uniform flow of spirits, and was greatly
esteemed by her neighbours as a person of the best moral
character.  She was remarkable for cleanliness in her per-
son, at her table, and in her house; and to the end of life
showed great attention to her dress.  To all her other ac-
complishments she added those of religion, the duties of
which she performed with an attention and zeal, highly
worthy of imitation.  Religion appeared in her with a
smiling countenance, guided her honourable through the
different stages of life, and ministered to her joy in its
evening.  Her sense of duty led her to industry; and her
religious principles and feelings bestowed upon her con-
tentment, and cheerful trust in God She lived like a
saint, and died like a Christian heroine.
