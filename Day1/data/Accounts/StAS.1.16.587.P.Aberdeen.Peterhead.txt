     of Peterhead.

   Living.-The living, by a decreet of the court of teinds
in 1792, which is not yet allocated on the different heri-
tors, consists of 5 chalders of meal, 3 chalders of bear, and
L. 41: 13: 4 Sterling of money, in which is included L. 8,
6 s. 8 d. for communion-elements.
   The glebe consists of different patches of ground, in
all betwixt 8 and 9 acres, part of the soil very indiffe-
rent, but now rendered more valuable by some improve-
ments of the present incumbent; besides a garden, and site
for the manse and offices, and a privilege of pasturage on
the links before the manse.

   Manse.-The manse is very old; was burnt in I740;
rebuilt a little afterwards by the last incumbent, on a com-
promise with the heritors; the walls of the former manse,
which were Built with mortar, I am informed still remain.
The whole of the house is very insufficient; the offices
were built about 16 years ago, and with repairs to the
manse, which were only about L. 5, cost the heritors L. 90
Sterling, the whole that has been paid by them during my
residence here.  It has cost me a much greatter sum for
some additional accommodation, and keeping the manse
and offices in repairs, which are renewed every year.

   Church.-The church was built in 1771, in the Kirk-
town, and is an elegant building 78 feet long, and 39
feet broad over the walls, which are of a proper height to
admit of the galleries being sufficiently raised.
   From the position of the pulpit, and the arrangement of
the seats, both in the galleries and on the ground-floor, it
is the most convenient place of worship with which I am
acquainted.  The plan was sent by one of the heritors
residing at Edinburgh, and was got from an eminent ar-
chitect there
