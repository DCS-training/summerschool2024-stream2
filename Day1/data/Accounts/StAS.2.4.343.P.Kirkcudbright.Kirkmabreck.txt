purpose of clearing the ground and fencing it at the same time.
A great deal more might be done in this way with advantage.
	Harbours.--At the " Point of Caskiel," there was a harbour
built about ten years ago, by the Liverpool Dock Company, for
the purpose of loading their schooners with granite. At Palnure
a place has been fitted up for loading and unloading small vessels,
but which is not worthy of the name of a harbour. At Creetown
the vessels are moored upon the beach, no other accommodation
having as yet been provided.
	Ecclesiastical State.--The church is built upon the Clauchan
Croft, near Creetown, and is very conveniently situated for the
inhabitants of the village, although not particularly so for the
landward part of the population. On the southern and eastern
extremities of the parish, some of the people are six miles from
church.
	The present church was opened for public worship on the 14th
December 1834. It is in excellent repair, and was reckoned, at
the time it was built, the handsomest church in Galloway. It is
seated to hold about 800. The landward population have their
sittings free. The inhabitants of Creetown have hitherto paid 1s.
each sitting yearly, which goes to the poor. Even this small
charge will soon be abolished, and the Gospel will be preached to
all " without money and without price."
	The following table contains a list, so far as can be ascertained,
of the ministers of this parish since the Reformation:--John Mof-
fet, (1535 to 1589);* James Donaldson, (1597); John Kallen-
der, (1601 to 1603; William Dalgleish; Samuel Row; Patrick
Peacock; Andrew Naughley; ----- Shaw; Patrick Peacock
again, (1689 to 1691); David Edgar, (1693 to 1701); Samuel
Brown, ordained 31st March 1703, died 17th May 1751;
Samuel Brown, ordained 6th August 1752, died 23d July 1779;
John Inglis, ordained 12th October 1780, deposed 17th April
1804; John Sibbaid, ordained 20th April 1809, died 20th
December 1833; John Muir, ordained 19th June 1834.
	Manse.--I have not been able to ascertain when the old part of
the manse was built. It must have been at least 130 years ago, be-
cause the Browns lived in it. The antiquity of the building may
be conjectured from the thickness of the gable walls.+ Repairs
