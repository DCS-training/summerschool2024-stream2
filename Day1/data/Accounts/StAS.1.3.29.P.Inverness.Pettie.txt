   Fish Harbours.-The Frith along the side of this parish
does not abound in fish; Culloden has on his property what
is called a stell fishing, where salmon are caught of an uncom-
monly excellent quality, but the quantity is not considerable.
At times haddocks and whitings are found in the Frith, but
rarely, and of a small size.  Haddocks of any size, and the
larger kinds of fish, as cod, ling, skate, etc. are seldom
found nearer than the coast of Sutherland or Caithness.
In some seasons herrings appear in this Frith, and in great
quantities, and continue several months, perhaps from Octo-
ber to February; but they generally take three or four years
to repeat their visit.  Cockles and muscles are found in the 
ebb, but in no great plenty.  About forty years age, there
were oysters in this Frith, but they are now entirely gone,
except on a small spot opposite to Culloden's lands, where
some are still found.  Inverness is the general market for the
fish caught by the fishers of this place and neighbourhood.
The landing places on this part of the Frith (for there are
no harbours) are but indifferent.  The water is shallow at
and near the shore, and at low water the sea retires to a
great distance.  There are two or three places within this
parish, where safe and commodious harbours for small vessels
might be made at a small expence.

   Price of Labour.-Labour is performed chiefly by servants
hired for the half year, who receive stipulated wages, and
their maintenance, either in the employer's family, or meal
in place of it.  About forty years ago, the half year's wages
to an ordinary farm-servant, including some small perqui-
sites, was no more than 13 s. 4 d.  When meal was given in
place of maintenance, it was at the rate of fix bolls in the
year, one-third of it oat-meal, and the other two-thirds bar-
ley-meal, either measured with the wheat sirlot, or weighed,
