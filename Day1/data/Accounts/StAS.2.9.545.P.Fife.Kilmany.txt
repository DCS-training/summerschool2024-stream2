ground for feuing and from the introduction of machinery for bodi-
ly and manual labour. In the last Statistical Account it is stated,
there are now livingin the parish 396 males and 473 females.
When the census was taken in 1821 the population was 751, 3.45
males and 406 females. In 1831 it had fallen to 707, 334 males
and 373 females, and since that date it is as low as 685 or 690.
From the time when the last Statistical Account was written, thrash-
ing-mills have been universally introduced, and have led to a consi-
derable diminution of the population; and individuals with large fa-
milies naturally retire from a parish, where there are no manufacto-
ries, to towns and places where they can obtain employment for their
children. The average of births for the last seven years has been 15,
of marriages 3; of deaths it is not so easy to speak accurately,
as some die in the Parish who are buried elsewhere, and many of
the dead from other parishes are buried in Kilmany churchyard.
This will appear evident from the following statement: There
have been buried at Kilman , for the last seven years, 106; of
this number only 45 have died in the parish. Those who died
here, and were buried elsewhere, are not recorded in our register.
I should think that twelve is a fair average of those who have died
in the parish for the last seven years.

   The inhabitants, from the profession which they follow, and from
their temperate habits, are healthy and strong, and many of them
reach tor very advanced age. Since 1830, there have died eleven
individuals, whose united ages amounted to 9" years; the average
age of each, 84,

and its population possessed of much natural talent, great industry,
and pious and amiable dispositions. Every clergyman who has la-
boured amongst them, has had good reason to bear testimony to
their,piety and correct conduct, and has received from them, many
