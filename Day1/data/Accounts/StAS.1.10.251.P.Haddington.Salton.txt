     PARISH OF SALTON.

     (County and Presbytery of Haddington.-Synod of Lo-
     thian and Tweeddale.)

     By the Reverend Mr ANDREW JOHNSTON.

     Name, Extent, etc.

   THE parish of Salton was formerly the property of Ni-
colas Soulis, one of the competitors for the Scottish
crown, mentioned in Lord Hailes's Annals, and was named,
evidently from the Lord of the manor, Soulistown, by abbre-
viation Soultown, and now, by obvious corruption, Salton.
   This district is bounded on the W. by the parish of Pen-
caitland, from whence it is separated by the rivers Salton and
Tyne, which here unite, and form a pretty considerable ri-
ver, under the appellation of Tyne.  From this river, the
land rises by a gradual ascent to the S. and S. E. exhibiting,
until it reaches the village of East Salton, a rich, regular, and
improved surface.  To the S. of this village, the face of the
country, for near a mile, is less favourable, till it reaches the
southern extremity of the parish, where the surface in some
measure resumes its former richness: As is the case with the
neighbouring parishes, a variety of soil is found, loam, light
sand, thin clay, and a deep rich clay; of these, however, the
most prevalent is the last.
