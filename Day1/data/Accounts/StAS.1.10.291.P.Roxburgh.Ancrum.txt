steep banks upon the verge of the river, in some places, nak-
ed and of broken surface, and in others clothed with wood,
exhibit a rare assemblage of romantic objects.  The trees sur-
rounding Ancrum house deserve to be particularly distin-
guished in a statistical description, being, I believe, the oldest
and most beautiful in this country.  They consist of oaks,
beech, elms, planes, and limes of a large size and bushy top.
The prospect from the house down the vale of Tiviot, and

   Ecclesiastical State, etc.-Sir John Scott is patron of the

The church is in good repair.  The heritors have voluntari-

schoolhouse larger and more commodious than in any other
country parish in this presbytery.
   The poor are maintained by a quarterly assessment propor-

quarterly assessments, than by paying the one half of them to
the collector for the poor, as is the cafe in other parishes.
The last quarterly assessment was at the rate of 3 s. 6 d. per
quarter on each hundred pounds Scotch of valued rent, and
the number of the poor upon the roll 24.
