or Collegiate Church, founded, anno 1433, by WALTER 
STEWART Earl of ATHOLL, (mentioned below,) who am-
ply endowed it with lands and tythes*, for the salvation of
his soul, according to the superstition of those times ; and who
was a principal actor + in the horrid murder of King JAMES
I. his own nephew.-An aisle, which was connected with
this last church, appears, from a stone built in the wall, to
have been erected by some of the Royal Family+.  On this
stone is sculptured the Royal Lion of Scotland, with the
Crown above ; and there are some defaced illegible Saxon
characters below.  This aisle may have been built by Marga-
ret the Queen Dowager, when she resided at the Castle of
Methven.  It is now the burying place of the family of
Methven.

tary offices, fell to CHARLES II. as his nearest male heir ; the
King's great grandfather's father, and the Duke's being bro-

and 10 chalders of meal.  By other accounts, the victual ap-
pears to have been 10 chalders more.  It seems to have been,
by much, the richest Collegiate Church in Scotland.  By the
erection, there were, besides the provost, 5 chaplains of the
choir of Methven.
