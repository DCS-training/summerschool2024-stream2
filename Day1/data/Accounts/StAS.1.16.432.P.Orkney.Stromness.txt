   Population.-In the process for augmentation of stipend,
(1754), the minister of these parishes represented to the
Lords Commissioners for the valuation of teinds, that these
parishes contained 2400 examinable persons, and in
whole 3000 people; that of there there was in the village
of Stromness 1000.  There are at present (1794) in the
village of Stromness 1344 souls, and yet, the whole popu-
lation is only about the same as that stated in 1754; by
which it appears, that the population of the two country
parishes has decreased, in the same proportion as that of
the village has increased.  By an exact list, taken in June
1794, the population is as follows:
