funds.  The managers of the Infirmary, seeing that it would be ut-
terly impossible for one physician to attend the sick poor who are
not fit for reception into the house, now that the town is increased
to upwards of four times the population which it contained at the
time of Mr Burnett's death, and that the General Dispensary is
well adapted to carry out the spirit of Mr Burnett's intentions,
but is very insufficiently supported by the subscriptions raised
for its benefit,-have resolved that the half of the fund placed under
their direction for this purpose, shall be given for the present to
that institution; its application to be under the direction of a com-
mitee, consisting of an equal number of Managers of the Infirmary,
and Directors of the Dispensary;-the other half they retain in
their own bands, to be applied for the maintenance of pauper luna-
tics from the town and county of Aberdeen in the Lunatic Asylum.
   Pauper Lunatic Fund.-In 1820, a fund was instituted for the
purpose of defraying the expense attending the maintenance, in
the Lunatic Asylum, of lunatic paupers belonging to the parish
of St Nicholas.
   The sources from which its support is derived are collections
(formerly annual, but which have been discontinued for the last
two years,) in the churches of the Establishment and in several
Dissenting churches, together with occasional donations and le-
gacies, and its management is entrusted to a committee, consisting
of the Established and other clergymen, with a few other gentle-
men annually elected.
   The annexed table exhibits the income and expenditure of
this fund, and the number of patients whose board has been de-
frayed out of it for the last seven years :-

   Murtle's Fund.-The late John Gordon, Esq. of Murtle, by
deeds dated in 1815, bequeathed a certain part of his property to
trustees, for distribution to various charitable objects, some of
which were, specified, and others left to the discretion of the trus-
