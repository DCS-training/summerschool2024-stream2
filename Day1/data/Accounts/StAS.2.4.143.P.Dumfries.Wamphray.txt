ing, &c. held out good encouragement to labourers, and thus in-
duced a number to settle in the parish. From the extensive ope-
rations then carried on, there was less occasion for continued im-
provements, at least to a great extent, and hence the population
has not increased since in the same proportion. In fact, the pro-
prietors feel reluctant to erect any new, dwellings, or to give en-
couragement to cottars farther than what is necessary, partly be-
cause they are aware of the difficulty of finding them employment,
and from the threatened scarcity of fuel; and partly, also, from the
fear of such inhabitants becoming ultimately burdens upon the pa-
rish. Of the population in 1831, there are about 500 in the coun-
try, and the remaining 80 in a village.

	There are nine proprietors, thd yearly value of each of whose lands
is upwards of L. 100 Sterling. Three only of these reside in the
parish, and have extensive farms from the principal proprietor; and
two of them also occupy their own properties along with these.
The number of inhabited houses is at present 94.
	Character of the People.--They are in general well acquainted
with their respective professions or trades,--regular in their de-
portment, as well as, with some exceptions, in their attendance
upon religious ordinances. As the farmers are perhaps the wealth-
iest in the south of Scotland, their houses are exceedingly clean
and neat, and they enjoy the comforts as mell as the necessaries
of life. The other classes are also in general cleanly. As most
of these have small pendicles of a few acres attached to their houses
and gardens, they possess advantages which might otherwise be
denied them. Thus enjoying the necessaries of life, they are in
general contented with their situation and circumstances. We are
sorry, however, to say, that a few do occasionally poach in game,
especially the salmon fisheries. A check which they have lately
received will, we trust, have some effect in restraining it: but till
the stake-nets on the Solvay at the mouth of the Annan are taken
