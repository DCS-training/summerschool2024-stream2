lies open to the most distant markets, has convenient stations
for shipping, and admits vessels of considerable burden.  The
fertile district of the Carse of Gowrie, is at no great distance,
on the north; and a well cultivated country approaches on
the E. and W.  There, a malting concern, of great extent,
might be established; and, in the immediate neighbourhood,
might be found no inconvenient situation, for any work re-
quiring a command of water, while Newburgh might furnish
plenty of hands for carrying on the operations of the manu-
facturer; as there are hundreds in it already trained to the
loom, who only want a spirited merchant, with an adequate
capital, to direct their industry into a lucrative channel.  The
time cannot be far distant, when there obvious advantages
will be seized, in an age of such commercial enterprise; and
then the town of Newburgh, long poor, though independent,
will become distinguished for the wealth, the industry, and
the number of its inhabitants, and better entitled to the atten-
tion of the philosopher and the statesman.
