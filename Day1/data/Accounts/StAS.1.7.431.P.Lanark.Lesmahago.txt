     of Lesmahagoe.

   The population of this parish seems to have been consider-
ably upon the increase during the first part of the present
century.  There is still extant an examination list of the one
half of the parish, made out by the Reverend Mr Robert
Black in the 1705, containing the names of 840 examinable
persons; and, supposing both halves to have been then, as they
are at present, nearly equally populous, the total inhabitants,
who were deemed examinable, were 1680.  But the late
Reverend Mr Thomas Wharry, who was a native of the pa-
rish, had filled first the one cure, and then the other, and
was minister for 50 years, has left an accurate examination
list of the whole parish, enumerated with his own hand, which
contains 2448 names, of 10 years old and upwards, taken in
the year 1730; and, supposing those under 10 years to be,
as at present, a little more than a fourth more, the number
of souls was then above 3000.  The same gentleman has also
left a copy of answers to queries, from a committee of the
General Assembly, in which he says, the number of persons
above 10 years was between 2900 and 3000.  This paper has
no date; but it is probably the answer to the inquiry set on
foot by Dr Webster about the year 1755, as Mr Wharry was
often heard say, in the latter part of his life, that the num-
ber of examinable persons was about 3000.  He died in the
year 1761.  Since that period, the number of the people
has been upon the decrease, as well as the fertility of the
soil.
