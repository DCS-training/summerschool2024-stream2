of Forth.  The coast here is partly flat, and partly high
and bold.  The fifth found on the other coasts of Scotland
are sometimes caught.  No rocks, banks, nor islands, with-
in the Frith, are off this part of the coast.  The sea-weed
is used as manure.  Kelp is occasionally made in small
quantities.  Salt is also made, which is reckoned of an ex-
cellent quality.  Soap is manufactured in smaller quanti-
ties than formerly.  There are two excellent harbours.
The one is situated at the village of Limekilns, and the o-
ther at Charlestown.  They admit vessels at stream tides,
from 200 to 300 tons.  Many of the articles imported in-
to the country are conveyed to these harbours; and from
them, a great deal of its valuable productions are exported 
to other parts.

   Agriculture, etc.-The foil is various.  The low ground
is a deep, strong, black loam, which gradually becomes
lighter towards the N.  Clay is found in every field, at no
great distance from the surface.  In some places it is cover-
ed with earth that is brown and gravelly, and in other places
with what is dark.  extremely rich, and fertile.  Above
the town, the soil is much inferior to the soil below it.
Though greatly improved of late years, yet many acres of 
moor and morass still remain in a wild and uncultivated
state, of which the one half is improvable.  In this, as in
the other districts of Scotland, husbandry was in a languid
state till about the middle of this century. Inattention, in-
dolence, servitudes, bad roads, the want of wheel carriages,
and other necessary implements of husbandry, prevented all
improvements.  The land is divided among 80 proprietors,
of whom the Earl of Elgin is the principal.  His Lordship
lately gave new leafes of most of his farms, and build excel-
lent farm-houses and offices upon them.  His lands are
sufficiently enclosed, and regularly subdivided, with fences
