     "In the excavations making at Pompeii, utensils are often found
seemingly in the very position in which they were last used.  This
may be accounted for by the suddenness of the calamity that befel
that-devoted city; but what induced or impelled the ancient games
ters, in this remote corner of the Glenkens, to leave the instru-
ments of their amusements in what might be considered the middle,
of the game, is more difficult to solve.  These relics, which are
in my possession, can now only be prized for their curiosity, the
singular position in which they were found, and the relation they
ear to ancient times."
     Buildinqs.--Two bridges, in the memory of man, had been
successively swept away by the rapid inundations of the Ken; and
it was only in 1822 that a structure of sufficient strength was
reared. Three of the piers were built on dry land. A partly new
channel was then made to give way to the water; and now the
violence of the current is principally spent on that portion of the
bridge which is founded on a rock.  This elegant yet substantial
edifice consists of five arches, is built of granite from Lowran, mea-
sures 400 feet, and can boast of an arch whose chord or span is
nearly 100 feet.
