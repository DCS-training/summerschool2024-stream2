confirmed by the parliament of Scotland, in the reign of
Queen Mary, or of James VI.

   There has been no emigration from the parish during the
time of the present incumbent:  But, almost every year, a
great number of young lads engage with the Greenland ships,
which touch at Briffay Sound on their outward passage in the
month of March and April.  They receive from 20 s. to 40 s.
a month.  Many of these men are landed on the island when
the ships return from Greenland; but many go at last into
the navy.  It is a fact well ascertained, that in the year 1763,
there were 900 Shetland men paid off.  What number re-
mained in the fleet after the peace it is impossible to say.

   The number of inhabited houses is 223.  In each house,
on an average, there may be from 6 to 7 people.  There are
at present no uninhabited houses.
