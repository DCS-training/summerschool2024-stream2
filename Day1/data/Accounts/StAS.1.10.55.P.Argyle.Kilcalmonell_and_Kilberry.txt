the same person to whom many other churches are dedicated,
and who founded the celebrated monastery of Icollumkill, in
Gaelic I Challum Chilli the island of Columba founder of
cells, a designation which would very naturally be given him,
instead of his former one of Ealla, when he arrived at the
end of his peregrinations.  Kilberry means the burying place

   Appearance, Soil, etc.-The face of the country has the great,

tuting by far the greatest proportion of the parish, is covered

quantity of arable land may be guessed at, from the account
of crops in the statistical table, the one half of it being sup-
posed annually in tillage.  The climate is distinguished by no
less variety.  The transitions from mild to cold, from dry to
wet, are sudden and frequent; embarrasing the projects and
disappointing the expectations, of the husbandman.  This oc-
casions frequent fevers in Spring and Autumn, but they are
seldom mortal and are almost the only diseases to which a-

cough, measles, and small-pox, but inoculation has of late
become almost universal.
