  relief is, from church collections L. 25; interest of funds, L. 12; pe-
  nalties from delinquents, L. 3; total L. 40. Necessity alone compels
  the poor in general to apply for parochial relief, as such application is
  almost universally considered to be of a humiliating and degrading
  nature.
     Inns.-There is only one inn in the parish, in a situation which
  renders it necessary for the accommodation of travellers; and being
  kept by a person of very decent and respectable character, it is be-
  lieved that it has produced no bad effects on the morals of the
  people.
                        MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
    Since the last Statistical Account was drawn up, there has been a
  considerable improvement both in respect of the general intelligence
  and morality of the people,and the comforts of domestic life. While
  the price of labour and land rent is nearly double, the price of grain
  is nearly the same. The value of cattle is indeed greater, but does
  not afford a sufficient remuneration to the farmer.  The system of
  husbandry (the seven-shift course) is perhaps, upon the whole, best
  adapted to the soil, climate, and local circumstances of the parish;
  but if agriculture continues in its present depressed state, a reduc-
  tion of rent would appear to be absolutely necessary to stimulate and
  reward the industry, and promote the comfort and happiness of the
  tenantry; and, as they hold their possessions from a family who
  have been long distinguished for a regard to their prosperity, there
  can be little doubt that, if a favourable change does not soon take
  place in the value of agricultural produce, this boon will not
  long be withheld.
