	" Here lies Arthur Inglis in Nethertoun, who was shot, at Stockleton Dyke by
bloody Graham of Claverhouse, July 1679, for his adherence to the word of God
and Scotland's covenanted work of Reformation. Rev. 12, 11.

		"When I did live, such was the day,
		Forsaking sin made men a prey
		Unto the rage and tyranny,
		Of that throne of iniquity,
		Who robbed Christ and killed his saints,
		And brake and burned his covenants,
		I at that time this honour got,
		To die for Christ upon this spot.
