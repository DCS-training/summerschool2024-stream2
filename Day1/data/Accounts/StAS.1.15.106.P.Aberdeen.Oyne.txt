mountain of Benochie, and the lands there are neither so
early nor so fruitful as those on the North side.  The new
plan of farming is gaining ground here, but very slowly, and
is far from being general.  This perhaps is owing in some
measure to the farmers being attached to the old husbandry,
but more to their being at a great distance from the means
of improvement, and to the roads being exceedingly bad.

   Proposed Canals.-A canal from Aberdeen to Inverury a-
long the south side of the Don, and another from Inverury
to Old Rayne, is at present projected.  If these public spirited
enterprises succeed, they will be of very great importance to
the district of Garioch, whatever profits the first supporters
of the scheme may derive from the undertaking.  Before
lime and marle were used in agriculture, the lands in this
parish, and in the whole district, were considered as the best
lands in the county, and the Garioch was commonly called
the Granary of Aberdeen.  But of late years the parishes on
the sea coast, which were not naturally so fertile, have been
more improved; and this district, for which nature had done
so much, has received but little assistance from art.  But if
the canals take place, it is probable, that the district of the
Garioch will become one of the most fertile and most valu-
able districts in Scotland.

   Obstructions to Improvement.-The farmers are in general
not opulent.  The leases are too short:  And very high mal-
tures at the mills are a great bar to agriculture, in this and se-
veral other neighbouring parishes.  In this parish the eleventh
peck of corns ground at the mill is sometimes paid; and com-
monly the thirteenth peck is paid for multures and services.
