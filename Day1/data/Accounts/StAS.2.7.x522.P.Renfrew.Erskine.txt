public works on the river Leven, and the Highlands generally, by
means of a steam ferry-boat. As this will afford a passage for
carriages six miles further down the river than the Erskine Ferry,
it must diminish considerably the traffic now carried on there,
though it will prove a great convenience to the public generally.
  Ecclesiastical State.-There can be no doubt that Erskine was
originally erected into a separate parish in the days of Popery, as
we find mention made of the Popish vicars and parsons who held
the living, such as "Robert Sempill, Vicar of Erskine," mentioned
in. Hamilton's History of Renfrewshire, and "David Stewart, par-
son of Erskine," mentioned by M'Lure in his History of Glasgow,
published in 1739. In this treatise, which is a very curious one
the author informs us, that 11 the incumbent of Erskine, previous-
to the Reformation, was one of the thirty-two prebendaries who
constituted the chapter of the archbishopric of Glasgow, whose
office it was to be electors of the archbishops and council for the
administration of the offices of their function, both with respect to
the ternporality and spirituality thereof, for the prebendaries of
the Episcopal see had a vote in the chapter, and a stall in the
choir, and had vicars under them, who served the cure in their
several parsonages and paroch churches, or parsons who had their
full tithes." Bishop Cameron, who was appointed to the see of
Glasgow in 1426, compelled the thirty-two canons of the metro-
politan church to build manors in the vicinity of his own castle,

at the foot of the Rotten Row, which belonged afterwards to
James Fleming by purchase of Mr David Stewart, parson of Ers-

to the parsons, of Erskine, as a charter still extant bears, granted
by Queen Mary to David Stewart, parson of Erskine, and sold
to George Elphinstone, son of a burgess in Glasgow of the same
name, and to this day the minister of Erskine receives the feu-
duty of the lauds, though the proprietor be a vassal of the Crown."
This feu-duty, amounting to the annual sum of 5s. Sterling, was
paid at stated intervals to Dr Young, the incumbent before the
last, till about the year 1799 ; and the late incumbent having al-
lowed upwards of twenty years to pass after his induction here
without claiming it, during which time, the persons employed by
Dr Young to collect it died, the proprietor of Blythswood, through
his agent, has lately refused to acknowledge the claim of the mi-
