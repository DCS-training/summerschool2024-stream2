whinstone and other lapideous strata; but it is not wonder-
ful, for, of the many attempts philosophy has made to get be-
yond its reach, none, as yet, seem to have been more unsuc-
cessful than those to discover the internal structure of the
earth, so as to ascertain the rules by which she has been
formed.  The various fossils to be found on this rivulet are
enumerated elsewhere, in the account of the parish; and in
consequence of the late remarkable stood in November 1795,
since writing the above, it has burst into a coal-waste before
it reached the falls, and its outlet has not yet been discover-

When, from the eastern extremity, the glare of a summer

Carlops Hill, in the distance to the right, the whole forms as
