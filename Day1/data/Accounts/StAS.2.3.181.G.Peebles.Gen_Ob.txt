		ON THE COUNTY OF PEEBLES.		181

    presumptuos; as in intelligent race of people, who fully under-
    stand their own interests, they might say laissez nous faire, when
    any wild and visionary schemes are proposed to innovate on their
    accustomed occupations and their peaceful habits.
    	The writer of these observations has drawn up the following
    tables, which contain chiefly a summary of the foregoing accounts,
    and holds himself responsible for their accuracy, -premising, 1st,
    That where Scots acres are given in the text, they have here been
    converted into imperial. 2d, That in stating the amount of raw
    produce, when the quality of any article has been given, but not
    the value in money, a calculation has been made according to the
    market prices. 3d, That such particulars stated in the tables as
    are not found in text have been ascertained from the writers of the
    respective Accounts.

<FOOTNOTE>A mistake has been made at p. 15. The sheep in the account of the parish of
  Peebles are all of the Cheviot breed, and not partly of the black-faced kind, as I there
stated. The following should have been the return:
357 stone of smeared white-faced wool, at 22s. per stone, L. 392 0 0
687 1/2 stone of unsmeared do. at 32s. per stone,           1100 0 0
                                                             _______L. 1492 0 0
  As, the annual value of sheep and wool is given, the grazing, amounting to L. 2000,
ought not to have been inserted. It is now deducted from the amount of raw pro-
duce in the above column.
  In this sum, L. 2400, are given as the price of wool, but there is no return for
sheep or lambs sold. The number of sheep in Tweedsmuir is nearly the same as in
Innerleithen; and the amount of the raw produce for them in that parish is L. 6215.
  This number is not given in the text; but, as twotei-esti-c there allowed for one
sheep, the above may be considered as the number of uncultivated acres. The same
applies to Manner.
