ably in their situation, and bring up large families in ge-
neral.  Their chidren cost them little, and as soon as
they can do any thing, are employed in manufactures;
their wages ared exceeding good, and couble of what
they were formerly.  The wages of male-servants are L. 6
and L.7, of female L 2, 10 s, and L. 3 a-year.  There are

   Miscellaneous Observations.-in general, the people are of
the middle size.  the greatest height which any have at-
tained, is about 6 feet 2 inches.  They are very much dis-
posed to undustry.-In the town are 3 principal manufac-
tures, under the name of Checks and Bed-tikes.  These
employ between 200 and 300 looms in the parish, and a
great number in the parishes around.  Two of these have
each an extensive bleachfield near by, where they whiten
their own yarn.  Besides these, are a few who do a little
in the same branches.  There are besides 5 cotton manu-
factures of the name of the Spinning Jeanies, the heavy
parts of which are driven by a horse-engine.  These em-
ploy near 200 hands, several of whom are children, etc.
Other buildings are presently erecting for the same, etc.
