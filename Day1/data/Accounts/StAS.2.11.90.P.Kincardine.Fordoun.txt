	No great increase or decrease has taken place in the population
of this parish. Being until lately, purely agriculture, any varia-
tion that occurred must have been occasioned by the enlarged size
of the farms, and the decrease of the cot-towns, more particularly
of Kincardine. The reduction thus caused in the agricultural po-
pulation has been more than compensated by the extension or ra-
ther creation of the village of Auchinblae, the only village in the
parish. But although the greater part of the inhabitants of this
village are employed in trade or manufactures, still many of them
occupy crofts or village acres, and may be considered as belong-
ing to the agricultural population, which, it would thus appear,
has not materially been diminished by converting the small farms
into larger ones.

	Two noblemen, viz. the Earl of Kintore and Viscount Arbuth-
nott, have estates in the parish, besides nine commoners,--thus
making the proprietors of land amount to 11. The rental of each
greatly exceeds L. 50 yearly. The only heritors or individuals of
fortune resident are, Dr Crombie of Phesdo; Mr Burnett of Mon-
boddo; Mr Carnegie of Redhall; and occasionally Captain Gam-
mell of Drumtochty. Two mansions, viz. Fordoun House and
Whiteriggs, are let to farmers.
