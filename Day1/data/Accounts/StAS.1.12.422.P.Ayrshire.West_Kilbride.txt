piness, contentment, and comfortable independence, of an ho-
nest and peaceable people.

   The men are, in their stature, generally above the middle
size, stout and well made, and make hardy husbandmen and
sailors.  And this leads us to observe, that perhaps no coun-
try parish in Scotland, has afforded so many men to the sea,
as West Kilbride.  From a calculation made in the year 1782,
it appeared that upwards of 63 men were employed in the
service of the Navy, or abroad trading vessels, and some of
them were in every great action sought at sea, during the late
war.  At present, the number is considerably less, upon ac-
count of the great encouragement, of late years, held out to
manufacturers, which induced many young men, who would
otherwise have gome to sea, to become weavers; the wages
and pay of a seaman, being so much below what can easily
be earned by the commoness manufacturer.  What a pity is
it, that these brave and useful men, from whole toils and
dangers, their country acquires so much wealth and glory,
are not more adequately rewarded!  This change in the incli-
nations of the young men, which determines them to prefer
the manufacturing to the seafaring line, may indeed be more
gainful to individuals, but in a moral view, promises no ad-
vantage to the community; as there is some reason to dread,
that the ingenious, frank, and manly character of the tar,
may, in time, give place to the petulance and effeminacy, the
turbulent, factious, and fanatical spirit, which experience has
proved to be but too generally attached to people who follow
the more domestic occupations.

   Concluding Observations.-We already took notice, that
one capital hinderance to the progress of agriculture improve-
ments, in this part of the country, is the duty on coals; the
repealing of this duty, therefore, wil be most productive
