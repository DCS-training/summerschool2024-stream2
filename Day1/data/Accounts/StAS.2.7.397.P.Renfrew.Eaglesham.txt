   The increase since 1791 is 1372.  In 1801, the number of in-
habitants to each house in the parish was, on an average, 6. At the
present time, it is 8, which is entirely owing to the establishment of
manufactures.  At present, the town of Eaglesham contains about
1750 inhabitants, namely, 879 males, and 871 females, of whom
845 live on the north side of the town, and 905 on the south side.
In the country part of the parish, there are 622 souls, namely, 300
on the north side, and 322 on the south side.  The population in the
country has fallen off from the enlargement of farms, and the de-
crease of cottars.   In the town, the principal increase has arisen,
as already stated, from the establishment of manufactures.  There
are about six families of independent fortune, and four proprietors
of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards.  The number
of families, as above, is 424, which is about 5 1/2 to each family.
   The number of illegitimate births during the last three years
was 3.
   The most popular games are curling and quoits. For the for-
mer of these sports, the parish affords every encouragement, from
the great number of lochs which it contains, besides streams and
meadows.
   Smuggling was at one period very common, but is now at an end.
Poaching still prevails to a considerable extent, not among the rural
population, where the greatest facilities occur and the temptations
are greatest, but chiefly among stragglers from the village,
who are bad sitters at the loom, or pursue no regular or creditable
employment.

                           IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Agriculture.-The parish rises to the west, and gently declines
to the north-east, and, of course, has not a good exposure. The
highdr districts consist partly of hill, bent, and flow-moss, with
meadows and green hills interspersed.  Along the Cart and banks
of the principal streams there is a light soil reposing on trap rocks.
The surface of the parish contains 15,503 acres and 37 falls, of
which 14,953 acres and 37 falls belong to the Earl of Eglinton,
and 550 acres are distributed among four other proprietors.  The
Earl of Eglinton's portion is thus divided in Scots acres:-
