to reap in harvest without receiving any thing but their
board; for which they possess a house and yard, have one
or two dargs of turf or peas, which their masters bring
home, and give them as much ground as the ashes will
cover for sowing barley.  They have likewise two lippies
of lint-seed sown, and half a firlot of potatoes planted.
Their crop, when it is good, constitutes a great part of
their living throughout the year; and, in that case, their
houses colt them little.  Hinds receive 8 bolls of oats, 2 bolls
of barley, 1 boll of pease, a cow's grass, and 1 L. 5 s. for sheep,
as the wages of their own labour; and are bound to the same
servitude with a cottager for their houses, lint, potatoes, etc.
The wages of herds are considerably higher than those of hinds,
and differ according to the extent of their charge.  They are
paid with sheep, and cows, which require a stock at beginning,
and subject them to frequent losses.

at Plenderleith, 3 old forts, and a Roman causeway.  The
chief fortification is a tower at Dolphiston, said to have been
built by one DOLPHUS, from whom it took its name.  The
walls are from 8 to 10 feet thick, built of hewn stone, and so
closely cemented with lime, that it is found more difficult to
obtain stones for building from it, than from a quarry.  It
has been extensive, and divided into small apartments by stone
partitions.  Several vaulted apertures are in the middle of
the walls, large enough for a small bed, and some of them so
long, as to be used by the tenants for holding their ladders.
On a rising ground, a little to the S. there is an area of a
chain square, which is said to have been a watch tower or
light house, and shows that Dolphiston Tower had been used
as a fort, or place of refuge.  The tower on Mossburnford
ground, N. from Dolphiston, which is nearly entire, is built and
