     NUMBER XXXVII.

     PARISH OF MAKERSTON.

     (County of Roxburgh.)

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES RICHARDSON.

     Name, Situation, etc.

   THE etymology and derivation may be, the Town of
MacKer, or Ker's Son.  It lies in the country of Rox-
burgh, in the presbytery of Kelfo, and synod of Merse and
Teviotdale.  Its form is a long square, stretching five or six
miles along the north bank of the Tweed, from east to west.
Its breadth, from north to south, is between four and five
miles.  The country is flat, with a gentle ascent from the
Tweed.  The air is dry, and the soil fertile.  There is no
lake or river, except the Tweed, which produces fine salmon
and trout.  The former are sold from 3 d. to 1 s. per pound,
according to the season; but by far the greatest proportion
is carried to Berwick, pickled, and sent to the London
market.  The Tweed is not navigable here.  The pastures
are for the most part rich, and so very fine, that they feed
the best mutton, though not the largest in this country;
with very good oxen, cows, and horses, that fetch high
prices.  A good many swine are also fed.

   Population.-The population of this parish must be greatly
decreased, which is the case in all the neighbouring country
