   Natural Curiosity.-In autumn 1792, the tacksmen of
a free stone quarry, belonging to the then Viscount of Stor-
mont, and lying near the foot of the water of Kutle, in
working the same, discovered a mass of tar, incrusted on
all sides with the rock.  The hollow in which it was
found, would have held about 1 1/2 gallons Scotch measure,
and the quantity of tar found was about 1 1/2 English pints.
When the tar was tried, it burned in the fire like common
tar, extracted from fir, but had a sulphureous smell.  It
was soft when found, and became fluid in the fire.  The
rock in which it was found is a white freestone, of a good
quality.  The workmen are of opinion, that it has pro-
ceeded from a spring on the north-west side of the quarry.
This spring leaves a black slimy substance like tar; and
this substance, as they think, oozing through the foot of
the rock, has produced the mass described above.

   Village of Springfield.-In the year 1791, a new village
was begun on the farm of Springfield, belonging to Sir
William Maxwell, where upwards of 40 houses have been
already built, or are now building.  This village is situated
on a dry healthy soil, upon an eminence above the Sark,
the river which is here the boundary of the united king-
doms.  The plan of the village is perfectly regular.  The
streets are 50 feet wide, and the houses are all built of
freestone or bricks, and covered with blue slate.  A great
part of the land adjacent to the village, and belonging to
the proprietor, has been inclosed, and the fences planted
with quicks and hedge-rows of trees.  Each settler is ac-
commodated with an inclosure of 6 or 4 acres at a mode-
rate rent, and upon a lease for 19 years.  The building
leases are for 99 years.  Several weavers are now settling
in this village, and as the proprietor is exerting himself for
the establishment of manufactures of different kinds, there
