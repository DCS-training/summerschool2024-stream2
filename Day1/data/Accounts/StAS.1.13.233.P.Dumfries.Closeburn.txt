     of Closeburn.

Monteath, Rector of Barrowby in Lincolnshire.  Close-
burn is quite surrounded by the parish of Dalgarno, which 
was annexed to it in the year 1697; and the extent of the 
two united, is abouth 9 or 10 miles in length, and as much 
in breadth, measuring from the extremities.  Near where 
the church of Dalgarno stood, there was a village, which, 
though there are now no remains of it, was in former 
times a place of considerable note, being a burgh of rega-
lity, to whose jurisdiction a very considerable extent of 
country was subject. 

   Stipend, etc.-The patronage of the united parishes ha-
ving been sold along with the estate of Closeburn, now be-
longs to Mr Stewart Monteath.  The stipend was aug-
mented in the year 1786, and is now L. 70 in money,
2 chalders of meal, and 1 of bear, with L. 5 for commu-
nion-elements.  The glebe is very small, no ground ha-
ving ever yet been set off for pasturage, either in Close-
burn of Dalgarno.  The glebe of Dalgarno, consisting of
4 acres and nearly one half, was exchanged in the year 
1732 for 3 acres and one rood, lying contiguous to the
glebe of Closeburn, which, in consequence of this addition, 
measures about 6 acres.  The church was built about 50, 
and the manse about 30 years ago; considerable repara-
tions were made upon both abouth 15 years ago; and they 
are now much better than is common in country parishes.

   Population, etc.-According to Dr Webster's report, the
population in 1755, was 999.  The number of inhabitants 
in the year 1778, was between 1000 and 1100.  Last year, 
(1791), they amounted to 1490.  This great increase has 
been occasioned by extensive lime-works in the parish, the
division of farms, making of roads, and other improve-
