ancient diversion, a company of genlemen, about 18 years 
ago, purchased a silver cup, which is played for annually 
in the month of April, and is for a year in the possession 
of the victor, who is obliged to append a medal to it, when
he reftores it to the company.  The inhabitants of Mussel-
burgh had need to watch over this precious field for health
and exercise, left in some unlucky period the magistrates 
and council should be induced to seu it out, on pretence of 
increasing the revenue of the town.  At present it is a
common, to which every burges has a right of pasturge;

seasons, and in all weather, as the place is as close as a house, while, at 
the same time, by opening the windows, which are very large, you may 
have a sufficiency of air.  There is generally a kind of apartment at one
end of the holf barn, two or three steps higher than the floor, where spec-
nators may enjoy the fight of the game, as far as the clouds of tobacco 
smoke, with which they commonly fill it, will allow.
