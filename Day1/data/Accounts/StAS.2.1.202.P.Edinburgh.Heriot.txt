led the Wolf's Cleugh, concerning which a traditionary story is told.
It is said that this cleugh was inhabited by a ravenous wolf, which
plundered and annoyed the neighbouring country, attacking and
destroying many who attempted to pass that way. At last a re-
ward of the lands was offered to him who should slay this de-
structive creature. One appeared who succeeded in slaying it,
and, obtaining the lands, called them Dewar, after his own name.
Near Heriot House, there is also a stone called Mary Gibb's, from
an unfortunate woman who is said to have been burnt upon it for
witchcraft.
   There is on Heriot-town hill-head a circle of high stones, 70 or
80 feet diameter; and on Borthwick Hall hill-head, three large
rings or ditches, about 50 paces diameter. Chalmers says that
these contain the only Druidical remains in Scotland, save those
in Kirknewton parish.

                    III.--POPULATION.
   From Borthwick and Scott's account of the parish in 1627, it
would appear that there was nearly double the number of inhabi-
tants then that there is now. It is there mentioned that the
number of communicants was eleven score, which, supposing that
number the third part of the population, would make it amount
to 660, which is more than double that of the present amount.
