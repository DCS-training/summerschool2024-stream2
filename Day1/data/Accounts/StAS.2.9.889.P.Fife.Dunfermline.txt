   Wages were wont to be paid per yard till within these 12 or 15
years, when they came to be paid per spindle of work, which is
thought an improvement, as being more simple. The gross ave-
rage amount of weekly wages, as stated by the operatives, is about
10s. 6d., but with deductions.for light, tear and wear, loom-rent,
and dressing, the average of net weekly wages is about 8s. 6d. per
week, for each loom. Journeymen receive nearly tbree-fourths of
the income, or 7s. 6d. per week, with the deduction of a small
proportion for light and twisting, amounting to about 12s. per an-
num, the remainder being the master's remuneration for the cost
of the loom-rent, &c., and the trouble of providing and superin-
tending the work. Taking the fine and the broad coarse goods
separately, which the journeymen chiefly weave, the average of
their wages will be somewhat higher than 7s. 6d. In some of the
warehouses, where the finest work is wrought, the earnings are
much higher than now stated.
   Although the weaver has certainly lower wages now than he
had twenty years ago, for working fine damask, he has much less
idle time in ordinary circumstances, in consequence of the use of
the Jacquard machines, and the yarn being better, not hand-spun
as before, but mill-spun, which is to a certain extent a compensa-
tion. Loss of time, on a change of pattern, may be reckoned as
occurring, upon an average, only once in eighteen montbs, but
sometimes only once in two or three, or even many years, accord.
ing to the pleasure of the manufacturer.
   Pirn fillers can earn, if they have nothing else to do, 10d. per
day, being paid at the rate of 2 1/2d. per spindle of weft. Bobbiners
could earn the same amount, but do not receive usually from one
warehouse more than from 4d. to 6d. per day, being at the rate
of 1d. to 1 1/2d. per spindle of warp, according to the weight.
