be well.  Why have the French been so long successful
against all who have opposed them, notwithstanding their
internal commotions, and bloody disasters, but that their fall
may be the more conspicuous; and that all men may know,
that this hath God done, to humble the arrogance of the
impious and terrible, and such as would not have him to
reign over them?  Why have we been so very unsuccessful in
gaining battles, but that we also have a debt to pay; the
debt of repentance for many faults committed; and the debt
of gratitude for many blessings and favours conferred upon
us, which we have been almost totally unmindful and regard-
less of.  This debt, however, must be speedily paid, and not
only so, but in the best manner we possibly can.  Raising
armies will not do, though with these armies we could de-
stroy all our enemies; for if God be angry, he can destroy
by famine, as well as by sword; and if this he is pleased to
withhold, he has other weapons equally terrible to execute
his displeasure.  Neither will a day or two appointed for
fasting and humiliation do the business, unless they excite
in us those dispositions of mind, which are best calculated
to regain his favour.  Let it become as fashionable every
Lord's day, for all people of figure and fortune, to attend
the sanctuary of God, as it has for several years been fashion-
able for some to contemn and dispise it.  Were this once
begun, the rest of the work would be pleasant and soon
completed; and what the work is two sentences could ex-
plain.  At present, all that is necessary to be observed is,
that if we are in earnest to preserve every thing that ought
to be accounted dear to us as Britons, we must in the first
place, be all of us at least professors of religion, and attend-
ants on the ordinances of the gospel, and the rest of the
work would soon succeed, to the wonder and astonishment
