   The price of oat-meal was then 2 s. 6 d. the stone of 17 1/5
pounds; higher than was ever known before or since.  In
this parish the heritors and farmers, by a voluntary contri-
bution, collected into two store-houses, one at each extremi-
ty of the parish, all the meal they could, and distributed
it among the poor labourers and artificers at 2 s. a stone, un-
til it fell in the markets to that price; and by thus losing  6 d.
a stone in the meal which they sold, they were the happy 
means of preserving their poor parishioners from the general
calamity of the country.
