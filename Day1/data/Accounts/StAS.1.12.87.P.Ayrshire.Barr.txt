7 s. 6 d. the stone, 9 d. the sleece, taking 10 sleeces to the

10 s.; but the wool of the long sheep, or Cheviot breed in
the parish, gave last season 15 s. the stone, 7 1/2 sleeces to the
stone, 2 s. the sleece; 50 score of which, at this rate, would
bring 100 L.  Fine wool in the lower parts of Galloway brings
from 12 s. to 14 s. the stone.  Suppose it to bring 15 s. the
stone, there is still this consideration in favour of the Cheviot
breed.  The Galloway fine wool will take 14, 15, or even 16
sleeces to the stone; suppose, in general, 15 sleeces, the Che-
viot breed in this parish, though of the small kind, take 7 1/2
sleeces only to the stone.  It therefore follows, that when 30
Galloway sheep bring 1 L. 10 s. for two stone of wool, 15
sleeces, and 15 s. the stone, the Cheviot breed, in number 30,
will bring 3 L., four stone of wool taking 7 1/2 sleeces, and giv-
ing 15 s. each stone.
   It is asserted that the Cheviot breed will require much bet-
ter feeding, consequently more grass than the natives of this
country.  This observation may be well founded; hut the
question is, how far and whether, upon this supposition, the
Cheviot breed of sheep called the long sheep, may not be the
most advantageous stock still?
   Suppose a farm holding 50 score, or 1000 short sheep, the
natives of the country, should not be able to keep above 40
score, or 800 of the long sheep, 50 score of short sheep will
bring 37 L. 10 s., at the rate of 7 s. 6 d. the stone, 9 d. each
fleece, taking 10 sleeces to the stone; 40 score of long sheep,
taking 7 1/2 sleeces to the stone, giving 15 s. the stone, will
bring 80 L. Further, if 40 score of long, eat the grass of
50 score of short sheep, it may be presumed that the long
sheep is a fifth part stronger in the bone, and, if brought to a
like state of fat with the short, will, in their carcase, weigh
fifth part more, give a fifth part more tallow, consequently a
fifth;part more money.  Therefore the produce of 40 score
