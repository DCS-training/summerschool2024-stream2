       			II.--CIVIL HISTORY.
   From its situation, this parish was long exposed to scenes of
turbulence and blood. When the carses were a morass, the
narrow space between them and the Lennox hills afforded
the chief, if not the only line of communication between the
northern and southern parts of the island, nearly cut asunder
by the Friths of Clyde and Forth. Nor is it till you reach this
parish, that there are any fords at which men or horses can pass
the Forth; and even now, there are no bridges lower down than
that of Stirling. Our neighbourhood to the Roman wall, and the
Roman road, which ran for seven or eight miles through the
parish, might be thought favourable to civilization, and so they
would had the province Vespasiatia been retained. But this
province existed only a few years. In the year 209, Severus
lost 50,000 men in attempting to recover it; and on his failure, it
is believed that the woods between the wall and Forth were cut
down by the Romans, thus desolating the country, to prevent it
from sheltering the natives in their incursions against them. If
this district was in a turbulent state during the time of the Ro-
mans, it was not likely to be much improved during the long and
dark period which succeeded their departure. When Scotland,
with a portion of the north of England, was divided into four
kingdoms, the Northumbrians and Cumbrians on the south, the
Picts and Scots on the north,--this parish, with a great part of
Stirlingshire, was, as in the days of the Romans, a battle-field on
which these nations contended,--a sort of border debateable
ground, which sometimes belonged to one nation and sometimes to
another. Even after Scotland was, united, and Stirling became a
fortified town and a royal residence, little was added to the peace
or improvement of the neighbourhood. Contests about succession
to the crown introduced the English who, like the Romans, wished
