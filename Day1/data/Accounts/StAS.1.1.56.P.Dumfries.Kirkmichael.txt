     Statistical Account

been uncommonly wet, the harvest was concluded only on
the 12th of November.

     Air, Climate, and Diseases.-From the quality of the soil,
the range of high mountains on the north-west, and rivers
and burns which run on each side and across the parish, the
air is necessarily moist; but, from the rapidity of the rivers,
the air is frequently changed, and seldom suffered to frag-
nate.  The inhabitants are remarkably healthy.  There have
been no epidemical disease for there last 34 years, except
the small pox and measles, which have never been uncom-
monly mortal.  Rheumatism are the most prevalent dis-
orders.

   Population.-The number of Inhabitants is 950, viz. 505
males, and 445 females.  The proportion between batchelors
and married men, including widowers, is as one to four
nearly.  There were no records prior to the year 1727, and
the records which were kept from that time to 1759, are so
inaccurate, that it is impossible to judge of population for-
merly.  About 30 years ago, the number of inhabitants was 
about 730; and consequently the increase since that period
is 220 souls.  The increase seems owing to the division and
cultivation of a very large common, and the improvement of
other lands.  The increase would probably have been much
greater, had it not been for the practice of leading farms as it
is called; that is, a farmer on one farm possesses at the same
time another smaller farm, which is said to be led along with
the other.  About sixty years ago, the number of farms was 
above 20 more than at present; and, within these few years,
seven considerable farms, that formerly had numerous fami-
lies residing on them, are now led along with others, and
are consequently uninhabited.
