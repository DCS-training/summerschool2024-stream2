<FOOTNOTE>

*Good masons, brick-layers, and carpenters, get 1 s. 8 d per day.  A taylor,
and brogue-maker, who goes about for work, receives 10 d. a-day, besides
victuals, and a common labourer, 1 s.  But, for this last class, there is not con-
stant work throughout the year; and what he earns, depends upon his own di-
ligence.  Where there is not constant work, the rates for day-labourers cannot
be fixed; and, of course, it is impossible to ascertain any determine income, or
any certain expence.
