poor clay, upon a cold till bottom.  Glenmore, in the upper
part of the parish, extending 8 miles in length, is covered
with heath.  The clay soil prevents the practice of turnip
crops, and winter feeding for cattle; and has occasioned se-
veral arable farms to be let for grazing.  No wheat is now
sown, except by the Earl of Dumfries; oats, big, or bear,
barley, clover, and rye-grass, are much cultivated, but pease
do not thrive well.  Lime is used as a manure on all the
farms.

   Climate, Mineral Waters, Fish, etc.-The ridges of hills to
the N. and S. of this parish, attracting the clouds coming
from the Atlantic, prevent so much rain falling here as in
other neighbouring parishes.  There are two mineral wells,
the one a chalybeate, and the other of a purgative quality.
Salmon come up the waters of Ayr and Lugar.  Trouts,
which formerly used to abound in the Lugar, are now become
scarce, owing to their being caught with nets, and salted like
herrings.  Pike come into the Lugar from New Cumnock
Lochs.

   Minerals.-On the estate of Auchinleck, there is an excel-
lent coal, wrought from time immemorial.  For 13 or 14
miles above the church, coal is to be found almost every
where, and is wrought wherever any demand prevails.  Above
the coal, on the rocky banks of the Lugar, there is a beautiful
bluish free stone, fine in the grain, which cuts well; and at
Bell's Park, there is a lead mine, which has never been
wrought, and is said by a skilful person to look rather like
silver mine.  On the lands of Wallace-town there is a quarry
of black fire-proof stone, carried far and near for building
ovens.
