in mosses, a variety of large trees, principally oak, have
formerly grown.

the town, rendered more accessible, which, at some ex-

distance from so flourishing a sea-port, might, doubtless,
in a short time, be greatly beautified and improved, when
we consider the natural inclination which town's people, 
as they become wealthy, discover to have houses, gardens,

public roads are still conducted in straight lines, over hills and rising
grounds; witness the road now to be changed between Port-Glasgow and
Crosshill.
