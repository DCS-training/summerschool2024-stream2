     Statistical Account

   Horses, Sheep, etc.-From the circumstances which have
been mentioned, the number of plough horses must be great-
ly diminished, more especially as the two horse plough upon
Small's construction, is generally used in the low grounds.
The number of milk cows, but especially of fat cattles must
be in proportion increased; how much I cannot say.  The
following table, however, will exhibit a correct view of the
whole live stock of the parish, and its supposed value, estima-
ted by a proper judge.

   But besides the above, there is a great number of young
cattle and horses, and likewise a few swine, which will at least
raise the general value of the stock to L. 11000 ster.  A milk
cow yields from 8 to 12 pints of milk daily.

<FOOTNOTE>

large country cows for the richest of his pasture; and reserve the hilly grounds
for the highland cattle.
   These things, however, are more attended to now than heretofore.
   The profits are of course greater.  Each cow for summer grass meal, is al-
lowed to yield from 20 s. to 30 s. at an average: when fed both in winter and
summer, each yields from 35 s. to 45 s.
   But in this account, I make no allowance for the loss of cattle, etc. etc.
which is sometimes considerable.
