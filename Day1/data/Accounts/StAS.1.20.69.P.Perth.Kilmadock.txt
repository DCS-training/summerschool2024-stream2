ed days the farmer is ploughing, sowing, and reaping, eve-
ry month of the year.  Wheat, rye, oats, barley, peas,
beans, clover, and rye-grass, flax, hay, potatoes, turnips,
and other roots, are crops that afford work to the farmer
in all seasons of the year, and hence he is enabled to manage
a much larger portion of ground than under the old system.
And when the improvement of roads, implements of hus-
bandry, mode of labour, etc. are brought into the calcula-
tion, it is at once plain how large farms have been introdu-
ced.
   It is said that large farms depopulate the country.  This,
however, is a conclusion that can only be drawn from a
partial view of the subject.  There are two species of la-
bour, unproductive and productive.  Unproductive, is that
labour that barely supports the labourer; productive, is that
labour that supports the labourer, and leaves a balance.
The balance is produced to the commonwealth, and so les-
sens the labour of others.  If one year a man supports him-
self only, and the next year he supports himself and his
wife, he doubles the population; if he supports himself, his
wife, and a child, he triples the population, and so on.
Hence, the more labour produced by art or industry, the
greater is, or may be, the population.
   From these facts, it is plain, that if the enlarging of farms
has not been owing to an increase of labourers on these
farms, but to art and industry, that the population is there-
by increased.  The population on the farms is indeed much
diminished; but the increase of the provisions brought to
market from these farms must evidently be capable of sup-
porting an increase of population.  If this increase of provi-
sions be exported for a supply of luxuries, the art and indu-
stry of the laborious farmer, no doubt, disappears, and is
wasted at the pampered tables of those who, in these days
of vice, prosligacy, and licentiousness, are falsely denomina-
