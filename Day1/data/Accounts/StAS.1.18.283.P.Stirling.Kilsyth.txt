prejudice, that they could be raised no where else to ad-
vantage.  Mr Graham, to show the absurdity of this opinion,
planted about half an acre of ground in the croft of Neilstone,
where he then resided.  This excited the attention of the
neighbourhood, and the report of it was soon spread far and
wide: insomuch, that people of all denominations, and
some noblemen of the highest rank, (among whom was the
unfortunate Earl of Perth), came to witness the plantation.
And had they known the amazing benefit that was to accrue
to the nation, from this fortunate attempt, they would have
doubtless hailed the auspicious event, and erected a monu-
ment to Mr Graham on the spot.  Regardless of the ignorant
ridicule to which his first experiments exposed him, he prosecuted
his favourite pursuit, with increasing ardour and success: and
by his persevering industry, and uncommonly happy talent
for prosecuting every species of improvement, he raised the
cultivation of potatoes in the neighbourhood of Kilsyth, to
a pitch scarcely yet, if at all surpassed any where; and to
promote the same spirit, and spread the blessing far and wide,
he rented lands in the vicinity of Renfrew, and Perth, Dun-
dee, and Glasgow, Leith, and Edinburgh; and for many
years obtained the premium for cultivating potatoes, till at
last no competitor was found; all were compelled to yield
the palm to him.
   This will not perhaps appear so surprising, if the following
facts are attended to.
   After an endless variety of experiments, which he very pro-
perly recorded, but the record of which is unfortunately lost,
he, in the year 1762, planted one peck of potatoes with the
dibble, and in October following, raised from the same peck,
16 bolls and 1/2 boll, or 264 pecks.
   As this may appear surprising, if not incredible to some,
