   Antiquities and Character.-We have no antiquities, ex-

parish of this county; and some cairns, under one of which
there is a tradition that Irvine, the laird of Drum, lies buried.
It is reported that he was slain in pursuing Donald Lord of

parish.  The people in general are sober, regular and indus-
trious, and are as contented with their condition as most peo-
ple.
