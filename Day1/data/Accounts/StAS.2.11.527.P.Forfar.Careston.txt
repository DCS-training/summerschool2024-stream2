	It may be here observed, that several larches of the late Mr
George Skene's planting have attained to upwards of 5 feet in cir-
cumference at six feet from the ground; and an oak has grown
more than 40 feet in height by a girth of 3 feet 9 inches at six
feet from the ground,-both were planted in 1782. Some time
before this, there was an oak planted by his father, which is now
6 feet 6 inches at six feet from the earth.

This last was blown down by the storm of the 11th October 1838.
The girth of all these trees was taken at six feet from the ground,
and measured with all due care by the forester.
	It may be here further noticed, that, towards the close of last
century, a small piece of ground being trenched, adjoining to
the castle, but remote from the garden, of itself spontaneous-
ly produced a thick crop of curly, or German green plants.
Before this, the above ground had been uncultivated time out of
mind, so that the seed of these plants must have remained a very
long period dormant in the earth.
