The duty on coal, for burning lime into manure, falls very

   Animals, Birds, &c.-The animals of the wild kind are
chiefly hares, foxes, weasels, and polecats.  The birds are,
crows of different kinds, especially the rook, the raven,
and the carion crow; partridges, blackbirds, herons,
thrushes, sky and wood-larks; magpies, robins, wrens,
linnets, goldfinches, bulfinches, wood-pigeons, hawks of
different species.  Gulls are found to flock hither before a

the swallow.  Our micratory birds are the cuckoo and
swallow, which last makes its appearance in May, and dis-
appears about the end of October.  The moor of Pert fur-

about the end of harvest.  In that moor also are plovers,

sometimes in hundreds during the night.  The parish also
breeds a considerable number of black cattle of a middling
size.
