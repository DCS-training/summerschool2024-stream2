     of Parton.

120 yards circumference at the base, which is circular.  It is 
surrounded with a ditch from 6 to 9 feet deep, whence the 
earth which compoies the mount appears to have been taken.
About half a mile north there is another mount, nearly double
the dimensions of the former, inclosed with two ditches.  On
a gentle eminence at 200 yards distance, is seen the remains
of a small Druidical circle.  About 3 miles north from the
church there is a remarkable heap of stones, from which the
farm where it lies seems to have been named the Cairn.  The
circular base is 120 yards in circumfernce.  A similar cairn,
but on a smaller scale, about a miles distance, was opened 50
years ago, and in, or toward the centre, was found a kind of 
stone coffin, containing something like fragments of human
bones.
