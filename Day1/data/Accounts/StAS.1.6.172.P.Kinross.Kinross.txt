boarders in the master's house.  The salary is L. 100 Scotch,
with a good house and small garden, and about an acre and a

   The number of indigent persons in this parish, who receive

this parish; but, as Kinross is a thorough-fare, and the roads in
every direction around the town exceeding good, it is con-
stantly infested with numbers of beggars from all quarters.

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-The valued rent of this parish is

tained, as most of the farms are feus possessed by the proprie-

of example.  For as the feuars, in general, are in that happy
mediocrity of station, in which, perhaps, the greatest con-
