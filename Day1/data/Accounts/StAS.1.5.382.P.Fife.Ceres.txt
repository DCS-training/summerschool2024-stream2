     Statistical Account

wheat, barley, oats, pease and beans, flax, clover, rye-grass,
potatoes, and turnips, is general, according as the different
soils are suited to them, and in such rotations as experience
has shown to be most profitable.  Since the introduction of
clover, the cultivation of pease and beans, has been less at-
tended to.  The quantity of wheat, sown annually in the
parish, is ten times greater now, than it was 40 years ago;
and the consumptions has increased in equal proportion.
The gross produce of all kinds of grain in the parish, may
be about 12,000 bolls, which, after deducting the quanti-
ty necessary for seed, will do a great deal more than sup-
ply the inhabitants.  Potatoes form a considerable part of
the food of the people, and are also used as food for hor-
ses.  The quantity raised is about 2000 bolls yearly.  The
foil being excellently calculated for flax, a great deal is cul-
tivated; the annual produce may be about 1500 stone
weight.  It will not be wide of the truth to calculate, that
three tenths of the ground in the parish are yearly in til-
lage; six tenths in grass for cutting, and for pasture; and
one tenth in moss, moor, and planting.  In ploughing,
horses are chiefly used; where oxen are employed, 2,
together with 2 horses, are reckoned sufficient.  Thirty
or 40 years ago, 4 oxen and 2 horses were employed in
each plough; 2 good horses are now found sufficient; and
the same man, that holds the plough, also drives it.  Both
the old Scotch plough, and the English, with a curved
mould-board, are used.  The latter now, is the more fre-
quent of the two.
