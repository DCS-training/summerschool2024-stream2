   The principal lime-work in this districts is at Craighead, a
hill near the western extremity of the parish, belonging to
Mr Hamilton of Bargeny.  The east face of this hill consists
of one vast unbroken mass of lime-stone, the dimensions of
which are imperfectly known.  In consequence of the in-
creased demand for lime as a manure, the rent of this quarry
has within the last twenty years risen from 10 L. to 245 L.
per annum.-Argillaceous marl is found in most parts of the
parish and has of late been used as a manure with great
success.  Beds of freestone are very numerous and extensive:
some of them uncommonly fine, and much esteemed in or-
namental building.  The principal ridge of hills on the
south side of the valley appears to consist chiefly of this sub-
stance, interspersed with strata of marl and lime-stone, over
which are piled up enormous masses of pudding stone.
Those on the north side are probably of a similar structure,
on some of them are found extensive rocks of a basaltic na-
ture, in the rude and irregular form distinguished by the
name of trapp.  In none of them have veins of any kind of
metal been discovered-In many places the land was for-
merly covered with a vast number of those "solitary masses
"of granite," so frequent in some other parts of Scotland, and
the origin of which has so long puzzled the ingenuity of the
naturalist.  Splitting and removing these has proved an ex-
pensive, but necessary step to the complete improvement of
the soil.
   Many small chalybeate springs, scattered over different
parts of the parish, seem to indicate the existence of exten-
sive strata of iron-stone; but their sources have never been
explored.-On the declivity of the range of hills towards
the north, a water, strongly impregnated with calcareous
