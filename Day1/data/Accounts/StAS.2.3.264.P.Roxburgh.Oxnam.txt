prevalent.  The value of many farms has been much enhanced,
by means of substantial fences, abundant draining, the liberal and
extensive application of lime, and more lately of bone manure too,
which contributes to unfold the energies of the soil in a wonderful
manner.  In some parts, no trivial advantage has likewise been
gained by forming embankments, though only upon a limited scale.
The duration of leases commonly extends to nineteen years, which
is held to be truly beneficial, both for the landlord and the occu-
pying tenant.  It tends to enrich the estate of the former, just be-
cause it admits of the latter being reimbursed for whatever expen-
ses might be unavoidably incurred in effecting judicious and im-
portant improvements.  Most of the farm-buildings are commo-
dious and handsome, and the state of enclosures is good.
     Recent Improvements.--Large additional plantations, and like-
wise numerous subdivisions and enclosures, have recently been form-
ed, especially by the Marquis of Lothian, whose excellent and li-
berally devised plans, when fully carried into execution, will great-
ly contribute both to beautify and enrich his baronial estates in this
quarter.  Of late, fences of furze, or whin, have been extensively
brought into use.  They succeed admirably well on moorish or
barren soils, where thorns would never grow; and when properly
dressed, besides being ornamental to the farm, are highly benefi-
cial to the farmer.  The roads running through the parish in vari-
ous directions extend to about thirty miles.  All the other roads, as
well as the main line, which leads most directly from Kelso to the
Carter, are kept in good repair.  They are upheld by funds arising
from the conversion of statute labour.  The rate of assessment has
seldom exceeded L. 1 for every hundred pounds Scots.  It may
be added, that the facilities of internal communication were happi-
ly increased by means of three stone bridges lately built.
     Amount of raw produce.--The average gross amount of raw pro-
duce yearly raised in the parish, will be nearly as follows:
