     Statistical Account

   Prisoners-23 Persons were committed to prison during
the last year; 12 of these for debt, most of them from the
country; 5 for a riot in Saltcoats against the presbytery, who
had gone there, at the request of the inhabitants, to inspect
the state of the school-house.  All of them stood trial before
the Circuit Court at Ayr; four of them were found guilty
but, by an error in the verdict, were dismissed; two by law-
burrows, two for riotous conduct, and two for petty crimes.

of its walls a little from the south corner of the present
church-yard; and that piece of ground being now in my
possession, I lately dug up part of their foundation.  It stood
near the brink of the river, which was a situation proper for
the monks of that order, whose principal food consisted of
fish; and, contiguous to the same spot there is a well, still
called the Chapel Well.
   That this friary was founded by the family of Fullarton is
certain, but in what year cannot now be known, as there is
reason to believe that the foundation charter is lost.  It is,
however, very probable that it was before the death of Alex-
ander III. in the 1285, as the distracted state of the nation
for many years after was very unfavourable for erections of
this sort.  The first authentic account that we find relative
