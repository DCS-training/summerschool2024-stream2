   The whole parish, excepting about 500 acres, is the pro-

distinguished by its poverty; at present, its surface exhibits
to the eye a rich and fertile prospect, and the increased

to new improvements; now his prejudices are so completely
removed, that he is eager to know and understand whatever
improvements others are attempting, and even to adopt such
as appear to be reasonable, though at first upon that small
scale which prudence undoubtedly dictates.  What better
subject could the Agricultural Society desire to cultivate,
than a farmer's mind in this particular state*

its local situation, and other circumstances, appeared least sus-
ceptible of such melioration.  By at liberal treatment of his
