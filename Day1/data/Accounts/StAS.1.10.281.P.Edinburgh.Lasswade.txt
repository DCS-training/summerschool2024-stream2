eight seams have already been discovered, has got the name
of the flat broad coals; their dip is about one in seven or eight;
their extent within the parish from S. W. to N. E. from
7 to 8 miles in length.
   The whole of these metals within the parish, and on both
sides of the river, dip to the S. E. but towards the S. E.
boundary, in crossing a certain supposed line, extending up
the country from the sea side near Musselburgh, the several
strata are known to take a rise towards both sides; and this
general line on the face of the country, corresponding with
the position of the strata below, has formed what may be cal-
led a trough.  That some of the uppermost seams of coal,
which are known to have a rise towards both sides, may be
preserved entire and unbroken, in their passage through this
trough, is not to be doubted; neither is it to he doubted, that
some of the edge coals, after sinking on the N. do rise again
on the S. side of this trough, but that they keep entire and
unbroken in their passage below this trough is held to be
improbable.
   The coal is distinguished by the terms of splint and rough
only, and possesses little of the caking quality of the Newcas-
tle coal.  The damps are of the mephitic kind, which extin-
guishes a candle.  Inflammable air was never seen in our pits.
It is not known at what time these coals were first begun to
be taken out, buts in the lands of Pendrich, it must have been
above 200 years ago.
   The annual produce has fluctuated much; at an average,
it may be stated at 30,000 tons, valued, at the pit-head,
between 6000 L. and 7000 L.  The price, when delivered in
Edinburgh, will amount, including carriage, to 12,000 L. or
14,000 L.  There are from 90 to 100 colliers, (pickmen).
Women are still employed as bearers below ground; their
number may be from 130 to 150.
