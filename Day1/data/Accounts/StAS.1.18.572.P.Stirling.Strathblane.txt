cy of the weather in winter would hurt them.  Of this ap-
prehension he has been most agreeably relieved.  They have
already stood two winters, as well as the rest of his stock;
and one of them was the most severe, that has been known
for many seasons.  The only precaution which he used, was
to keep them on his low grounds during winter; but in sum-
mer, they are fond of feeding on the tops of the hills, and
thrive there as well as the native breed.  Their lambs are
equally hardy as themselves, and promise to become a great
acquisition to the country; the wool being much superior to
any ever known in this place.  Each ewe produced L. 4, and
the ram L 5, which brought 3 s 6 d per pound, and was even
at that price sold much under value.
   Last year he crossed the breed with the Spanish ram and
Scots ewes; and also with a Scots ram, and the Spanish
ewes; and this experiment has succeeded beyond expectation.
The lambs thus generated, have wool little or nothing infe-
rior to the old Spanish sheep, and they may be expected to
be even hardier than these, as being inured to the climate
from their birth.  In short, there is nor a doubt, if he had a
sufficient extent of low ground to winter a large stock upon,
that Mr Edmonstone would push this experiment to 2 degree
which might prove highly beneficial to himself, to his land-
lord, and, as setting an useful example, to the whole country.
   In autumn last, he also procured a few Cheviot ewes,
which he has crossed with his Spanish ram.  It is expected
this will produce a hardy breed, and improve the wool to a
still greater degree of fineness, than the crossing with the
common Scots ewes; but on the success of this experiment,
time must be left to decide.
