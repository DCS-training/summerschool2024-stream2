or art, as their genius leads them.  None have perished
from want, since the end of the last century, when there
were seven years of general scarcity, and when some per-
sons were found dead with cabbage, kail-roots, etc. in their
mounts. 

   Sheep.-The number of sheep is about 6770, of lambs
1256.  But as a great number of lambs perish through the
weakness of the ewes, owing to severe winters and springs,
there are brought annually from the southern counties about
678, part of them lambs, but for the most part year-olds,
because these last stand the winter better.  Hence the an-
nual increase arising from lambs produced at home, and
from those brought from the south, is about 1934.  But of
these generally one third  is destroyed, before they come to
full maturity, some by foxes, some by severe winters and
springs, some are amissing, and many are cut off by a dis-
ease, which is here called the Braxes.  Hence it happens,
that the sale of old sheep annually amounts only to 2-3ds of
1934, that is 1289.  The south country, or what is here
called the Yarrow brood, are of a larger size than the na-
tive kind, and bring a higher price from the butcher; but
their wool is much coarfer.  There is now such a mixture
of the two breeds, that hardly any of the native kind are
to be found pure.  The wool of the native kind, several
years ago, used to sell at 1 s. 3 d. per lb., and at present it
easily brings that price, when pure; while that of the Yar-
row breed brings only 10 d. or 11 d.  The pound con-
sists of 24 ounces English.  Many of our farmers begin to
think that they would have acted more wisely, had they en-
couraged their own native breed:  for they find, in the first
place, that the Yarrow breed requires much more pasture;

That their wool is of a much coarser quality.  A wedder
