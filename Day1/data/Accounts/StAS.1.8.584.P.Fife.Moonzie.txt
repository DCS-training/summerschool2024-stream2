   Church, School and Poor.-The value of the living, includ-
ing the glebe, is about 90 l. Sterling.  Lord Crawfurd is pa-
tron.  The manse got some repairs last summer, and the kirk
and offices will need them soon.-The schoolmaster's salary is
5 l. 10s. per annum.  The school dues are very small.-There
are only 3 or 4 persons in the parish who get charity; but
they do not need much.  The fund is very small.

   Character, etc.-The people are very decent and regular in
their attendance upon divine worship.  They are also very
diligent and industrious in procuring subsistence for their fa-
milies.-This parish labours under no particular disadvantage.
It is a great way off from coal; but there is now a fine turn-
pike road the most of the way.  It has one great advantage,
that it is within 2 short miles of the town Cupar, where the
people get a good price for any thing they have to sell.
