the sea.  Afterwards the town was built at the foot of the
hill, on the S. where it now stands.  Dunse is the presby-
tery-seat of that name, and belongs to the Synod of Merse
and Tiviotdale.-The parish is an oblong square of 8 miles
from N. to S. and 5 from E. to W.  It is bounded on the
N. by the parish of Abbey St Bathan's, on the N. W. by
Longformachus, on the W. and S. by Langtoun, on the S.
E. by Edrom, and on the E. and N. E. by Preston and
Bunkle.  That part of the parish which runs up into Lam-

sharp, gravelly, dry soil, on which the tenants grow very
good barley, oats, turnip and clover.  In the south part of
it, the soil is a rich, light, deep loam, some of it a strong
clay, and very fertile.-The air is dry and healthy.  The

climate greatly changed.  The cleaning of the streets of the
town, and of ditches in parks adjoining to it on the
south, has also greatly contributed to the health of the in-
habitants.  It may be remarked also, that 40 years ago,
when the ague was very prevalent in the Merse, it was not

   Dunse Spaw.-There are no mineral springs in the pa-
rish.  But there is one within a very few yards of the boun-
dary, on the south, in the estate of Mrs Carr of Nisbet, in
the parish of Edrom.  It is called Dunse Spaw, from its
vicinity to the town, being only a mile distant.  It was
discovered in 1747, and was very much resorted to for se-
