oats, commonly cultivated, was of the grey kind; but, in a
few yeas after, it entirely disappeared., and gave place to the
white oats.  The marle is far from being yet exhausted, and
where it begins to fail, lime is substituted in its place.  In-
deed, marle was observed to produce such wonderful effects,
that those farmers, who had not access to it, were soon indu-
ced it even ten or twelve miles by land carriage.  It has been
observed, that, whenever the land has been once enriched
with lime or marle, and afterwards laid down into pasture,
that the ground, early in the spring, is covered with daisies,
which are succeeded, in the beginning of summer, with a
plentiful crop of white clover.

   Fuel.-The fuel commonly made use of is peat.  There are
several mosses, from which, the farmers are allowed the privi-
lege of taking what they require.  Some of these contain
marle, under 3 or 4 feet of moss.  There is one large moss,
which not only furnishes fuel to the families residing upon
the estates of the gentleman, whose property it is, but to o-
thers in the parish and neighbourhood.  Some is sold at the
rate of 2 s. each cart-load; but this by way of favour or conni-
vance.

   Heritors and Rent.-The heritors, or owners of land in
the parish, are seven in number.  One of them, proprietor
only of a small estate, resides in it.

   The land rent of the parish, twenty years ago, was L. 900.
it is now, L. 1540.  To give an idea of the rise of rents, it
is said, that three farms, which together yield, at present,
L. 100 per annum. were possessed, towards the end of last century,
upon condition of paying the public burdens upon the estate
