proper tackle and of perseverance.  The sea animals, plants,
and sea-ware, are the same as is common over all the High-
land coasts Little kelp is made here:  At an average, not above
8 tons per annum.  The tide flows northward.

   Harbours and Ferries, etc.-There are 4 good ones; namely,
Oban.  Dunstaffnage Bay, Ardintraive, opposite to Oban, in the
island of Kerera, and the Horseshoe Harbour, a little to the west-
ward of Ardintraive in the same island.  There are 3 ferries,
viz.  Conil Ferry, between this parish and that of Ardchattan;
Port Kerera, between the main land and that island; and the
Mull Ferry, between the latter and the Island of Mull.  There
is a very remarkable current at the Ferry of Conil.  From
the Sound of Mull enters an arm of the sea, which runs up
about 8 miles due E.  to Bunaw, in Muckairn, where the
Lorn-Furnace Company have their residence.  It then turns
to the N. E., through a glen in Ardchattan parish, named
Etive, about 10 miles.  At Conil, where it enters by a nar-
row pass, being confined at half flood, and half ebb, it rushes
through with impetuous force, like a rapid river, over a
rock, which is seen at low ebb, and reaches almost from side
to side; excepting that, on the Kilmore side, it has an opening
wide enough for vessels of considerable burden to pass through.
The sea, at halt tides, pours furiously, and with some noise,
over this rock, and forms a vast variety of little whirlpools,
especially on the side next the ocean.  The ferry here, though
in appearance very formidable, is yet safe, by reason of the
skill of the ferrymen in piloting their boats through it; and
may be crossed with safety, when some greater, and seemingly
smoother ferries cannot.

   Volcanic Appearances.-There are some appearances of this
kind on part of the coast.  There are stones of different spe-
