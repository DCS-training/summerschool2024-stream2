time, fished in by many other individuals.  There are twenty-
seven such pools in this parish, so that the fishery must have been
an important one; but now, owing to the river being, diverted from
its; bed near the sea for manufacturing purposes, no salmon are
found in it here, excepting afetr high floods that fill the bed, and
enable, the fish to make their way over the wears.  The Don and

The following table of this was made up after a very particular in-
quiry of nearly all the possessors of land, the answers to which, it
is believed were generally given with great accuracy and fidelity.
The yearly value of pasture, turnips and fodder could ascer-
tained only from the yearly gross profit of black-cattle, young
horses, sheep, and pigs; and this has been estimated not only by
the particular inquiries, but by an average applied to the whole
number of beasts from certain known stocks, of which regular ac-
counts have been kept, the results derived from these two sources
agreeing well with each, other.
