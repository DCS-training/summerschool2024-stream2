a very uncommon appearance.  They contain no rock, but
when dug into, discover nothing but strata of dead land or
coarse gravel.  They are generally covered with a short
heath or broom, having little or no soil upon the surface.
North from these tumuli, the ground rises to a large moor,
called the moor of Tullibardine, the property of the Duke
of Athole.  It is continued from the Grampian hills in
Muthil parish, and descends gradually eastward to the parish
of Auchterarder, dividing Strathallan from Strathearn, and
the south side of this parish from the north.  It is about two
miles in breadth, is perfectly flat, and every where covered
with heath.  From this to the north boundary of the pa-
rish, the ground rises and sinks alternately, according to the
course of several rivulets which run through it from west to
east, till they fall into the Earn.

   Soil and Climate.-The soil is this parish is not good.  In
geneal, it is thin, with a coarse gravelly bottom, and may
be divided into wet and dry in the extremes.  A great part
is soaked in water, which issues from numberless springs, or
runs between the upper sward and the gravel below.  What
is dry is a light sharp mould, mixed with land, and a vast
number of small stones.  In some places, the soil is deep, and 
consists of a cold wet sandy clay, with moss or dead sand be-
low.  Some few spots, that have been long cultivated, are
tolerably fertile when the season is good; but the far greater
part of the ground in tillage has not the smallest pretentions
to fertility.  But, bad as the soil is, the climate is still more
unfavourable.  Great part of the parish lies very high above
the level of the sea, and with the Ochil hills between it and 
the sun.  The effects of the cold are sensibly felt in retard-
ing and marring the growth of vegetables.  Owing to the
vicinity of the Ochill hills, we are exposed to continual rain,
