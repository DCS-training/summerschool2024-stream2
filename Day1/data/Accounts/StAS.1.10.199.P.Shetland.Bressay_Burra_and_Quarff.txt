     of Bressay, Burra, and Quarff.

   According to the registers of Bressay, there were 110
males and 116 females baptised, and 63 couples married, in
10 years preceding 1792.  The registers of Burra and Quarff
are in such disorder, that no extract of marriages and bap-
tisms, to be depended upon, can be given from them.
   The return to Dr Webster in 1755 was 1098 souls.
   From the best information which could be obtained on this
subject, it appears, that, within there 20 years, the number
of inhabitants in Bressay and Quarff has increased at least
200.  Burra has long continued stationary in this respect.
In most countries, the increase of population is reckoned an
advantage, and justly.  It is, however, the reverse in the pre-
sent state of Shetland.  The farms are split.  The young
are encouraged to marry, without having any stock.  The
consequence is poverty and distress.  Were manufactures
established here, to employ the people, and enable them to
procure a comfortable subsistence, their increased numbers
would be pleasing to every patriotic mind; but, it is believed,
that there is at present, in these islands, double the number
of people they can properly maintain.
   There are about 79 servants, of both sexes, in these pa-
rishes, the greatest part of which are employed in country
affairs.  There are 11 taylors, 2 smiths, 4 shoemakers, 2
carpenters, 1 joiner, 1 wheelwright.  The people here dis-
cover great ingenuity in the different handicraft employments.
Most of them are self-taught, and can work at different trades.
Necessity has made them exert themselves.

oil, with some money for boat-teind, and may be worth 65 l.

at a very considerable expence.  There are 2 churches 10
