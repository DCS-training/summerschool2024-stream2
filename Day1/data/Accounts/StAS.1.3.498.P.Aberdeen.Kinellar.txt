superior to any of the same plant, that he had ever before
seen.  After this, he continued to hoe and thin all his sub-
sequent growths of turnips in the same manner.  In the next
year, a neighbouring gentleman sowed some turnips in a field,
and although he did not use a hoe in weeding them, yet
thinned them so as to leave about a hand-breadth of ground
open around each plant.  His crops answered equally well.
In 1760 or 1761, the practice of hoeing was generally a-
dopted, by all who sowed turnips through the parish.  The
culture of this plant has, since that time, become gradually
more common; and it has contributed greatly to clear the
ground of wild oats, and other weeds, which used before to
choke the corn; and the turnips have been very profitably
made use of, in feeding and fattening cattle.  The intro-
duction of grass seeds has been no less favourable in its in-
fluence upon agriculture.  Before the use of these was
known, those parts of our lands which were cultivated, were,
(however much exhausted), kept almost continually in crop,
the farmers being unwilling to suffer them to rest; because,
for the first two years, fearcely any other vegetable but the
linking May weed appeared upon them.  The constant suc-
cession of crops then was, one crop of barley immediately
after the land had been manured; then two crops of oats;
after which the manure was again laid on.  This succession
is still in some measure continued, notwithstanding the im-
provements which have taken place; but the land is always
very much exhausted by successive crops of oats.  August
and September are commonly the months of harvest labour.
On the lands adjoining to the river Don, which passes 
through the parish, the crops ripen early.  They are some-
what later towards the south.  March is the seed time for
oats; barley is sown in the end of April and beginning of
May.
