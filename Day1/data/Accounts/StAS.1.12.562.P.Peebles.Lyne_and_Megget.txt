rams and ewes, which are kept as a breeding stock.  After
all, if it can be ascertained, from experiment and undoubted
facts, that any change whatever, either in the kind or ma-
nagement of sheep, will, upon the whole, be more advan-
tageous to the farmers, than the mode at present adopted, it
is not to be doubted, that the sagacity of that class of men,
in this county, will soon induce them to pursue that plan.

   Causes of Depopulation.-The causes commonly assigned
for the decrease of population in this district, are the demo-
lishing of cottages, and the junction of sheep-farms.  With
respect to the first, farmers are now generally convinced of
the necessity of encouraging cottagers, by building houses for
them, though the reverse was too much the practice a few
years ago.  Cottagers, by living at a distance from towns, are
commonly strangers to dissipation and vice, their childre are
often numerous and healthy, and almost always make the best
country servants.  But, with regard to the second cause, men
of observation are not so unanimous.  For it has been warm-
ly disputed, whether extensive farms be, upon the whole, fa-
vourable or unfavourable to the population and prosperity of
a country.  Before we can determine this point, it is neces-
sary that we attend to the situation and circumstances of the
country where the farms lie.  In the vicinity of a large town,
where plenty of manure can be procured, or, in a rich soil,
where, by means of lime and marl, cultivation may be car-
ried to a high pitch, farms of a moderate extend are certain-
ly proper, because the culture of them requires many hands,
and much attention.  But in proportion as farms are more
distant from the means of improvement, and the soil of them
less rich, in the same proportion, it would appear, may they
increase in size, because the quantity of land under tillage be-
ing necessarily small, less attention and industry are requisite.
