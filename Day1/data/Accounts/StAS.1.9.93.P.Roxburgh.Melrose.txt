     of Melrose.

there has been a large camp with a deep ditch.  It seems
to have been about 3 quarters of a mile in circumference,
and is called the Chester-know or Knoll.
   Mr Milne describes other camps, several of them large,
and gives an account of other antiquities and particulars re-
ferring to this parish.
