     of Daviot.

   Heritors.-There are 4 heritors in the parish; of whom one
resides.

   Ecclesiastical State.-This parish was formerly a parsonage
or prebend in the diocefe of Aberdeen, and was given as an
alm's gift by Malcolm Canmore to the Bishop of Aberdeen.
-The stipend was lately augmented, and is now three chal-
ders of victual, and L. 53:6:8 sterling.

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-The people are in general sober, in-
dustrious, and peaceable, and contented with their situation.
-The advantages are early harvests, good soil, and the indus-
try of the people; the disadvantages are short leases, distance
from lime, (from Aberdeen twenty English miles), and want
of encouragement to improve to improve on any large scale.

   Longevity.-One person in this parish died at the age of 113;
her son is now 100, and in good health.  The late incumbent
at Daviot was about 56 years minister.  At the time he was
50 years minister of this parish, there were four elder mem-
bers in the presbytery of Garioch, the eldest of whom was in
the 61st year of his ministry, and other two lived till they
were 60 years ministers of the Established church.  It is strong
evidence of the healthy climate of the Garioch, that out of
15 members of presbytery, the 5 oldest upon the roll lived to
be all of them nearly, and some of them above 60 years mi-
nisters, and from 80 to 90 years old.
