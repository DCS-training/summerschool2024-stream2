for the family of Lanerick.  The chapel likewise stands on
the south banks of Teith.
   The fifth was on the banks of the same river, at Torry,
opposite to Cambusmore, and the place is now covered with
wood.
   The sixth was erected at Walton, a little east of Thorn-
hill.  This last is quite demolished, and not even the foun-
