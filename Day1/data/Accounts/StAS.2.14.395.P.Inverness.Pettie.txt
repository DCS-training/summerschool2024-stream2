small farms into large ones, was effected about twenty years ago on
the Earl of Moray's property, were it not that a compensation was
found for the decrease of tenants in the growth of the village of Stu-
artown, and of hamlets on the property of Gollanfield. A few years
ago, about fifty persons of all ages emigrated to Canada. Some fa-,
milies of fishers have also been obliged to remove from the parish;
some of them have gone to Tarbet (Ross-shire,) and others to
Burghhead. The village of Stuartown (on the Earl of Moray's pro-
perty,) which may be called the suburbs, and forms about a third
of Campbeltown in Ardersier, (which is Lord Cawdor's property,)
and which is the only village in Pettie, contains about 30 families
of fishers, pensioners, and labourers.

   Only one heritor can be said to be resident, viz. the proprietnr
of Gollanfield. Members of the Earl of Moray's family spend,
occasionally, a few davs of the partridge-shooting. season, in Castle
Stuart. Major Fraser of Flemington, having duties to discharge
as Acting Governor of Fort George, generally resides in the
Fort.  Neither of the other two heritors have a residence in the
parish.
   Of insane and fatuous persons there are six, three of each-
Sex: and there are three persons totally blind.
   Language.- English is the sole- language of some of the fami-
lies, but chiefly on the Earl of Moray's estate. The greater pro-
portion of the farm-servants, and all the old aboriginal tenantry,
prefer to speak Gaelic. A man now living recollects the time when
there was not on all the Culloden estate, one who could tell a tra-
veller the road to Inverness in English. Forty years hence, we ap-
prehend it will be nearly as difficult to find many in the parish,
who, if questioned in Gaelic, will be able to'answer in that lan-
guage.
