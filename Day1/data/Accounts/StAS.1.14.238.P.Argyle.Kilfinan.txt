est number, if they should be experienced farmers, want
the means of doing it; as they are, in general, poor.
There is plenty of excellent limestone in the parish, and
convenient enough for the most of them; yet it is rare
to see a kiln burnt for the use of the ground.  It may be
said, indeed, that the inconveniency of peats, and the op-
pressive tax, until the late, upon coals, is the cause
of this; but allowing this to be a good reason, why
is not every farm covered with shell-sand, which is
found upon the coast in great abundance, and of the very
best quality?  All the farmers in the parish allow it to
be far preferable to lime, yet very few make use of it.
The very sea-weed, which is thrown in by the storm
upon the shore, is often allowed to rot, where the tide
has left it, although it is found to be as good manure for
barley, as any that can be made use of.  Of late years,
indeed, there is one kind of improvement begun, and like-

of horses in their ploughs, and using carts instead of

that are raised in the parish, are a few pease, and pota-
toes in abundance.  Summer fallowing is entirely un-
known to them.  As to these matters, it is thought they

summer fallowing, and the climate is no way favourable
to green crops.  The only trial that is known to have
been made of raising wheat, was by Mr. Lamont of
Lamont, who sowed about 3 firlots these two last seasons
past, and it answered pretty well.  There is not the 
smallest reason to doubt, that in many parts in this pa-
