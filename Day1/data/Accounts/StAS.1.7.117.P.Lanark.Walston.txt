most part, glazed, but few of them are made so as to open:
And the common people universally sleep in close timber
beds.  Few of them are sufficiently convinced of the vast ad-
vantage of having their bed clothes exposed to the fresh air;
or of the danger of sleeping in a place too much confined.
Between this parish and Dunsyre runs a small river called the
Medwin, in which there are a few excellent trout.  About
two miles to the north-east of this place, part of the Med-
win runs off to the Tweed.  The rest of it falls into the
Clyde, about 5 miles south-west from this.  Here the Med-
win is said to be about 750 feet above the level of the sea
and by observations made with the barometer, an high hill
in this neighbourhood, called Walston Black Mount, appears
to be nearly 800 feet above the level of the Medwin.

   Population.-This parish was formerly more populous than
it is at present.  From various causes, many of the parochial
registers of marriages, births, and burials, have not been, ac-
curately filled up, and consequently are not much to be trust-
ed.  In making out the following abstract from the session
records of Walston, those periods have been chosen in which
the records seem to have been regularly kept.
