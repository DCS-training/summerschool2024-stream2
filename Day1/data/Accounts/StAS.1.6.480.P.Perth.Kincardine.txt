   Rivers, and Fisheries, etc.-The Goody, a small river, is
the only one that has its course through the parish.  The Forth,
before mentioned, is compossed of two streams, that unite a
little way above the bridge of Abersoil, and form the Avondow,
or black river; when it enters the parish of Port, it takes the
name of Forth, which is said to be synonimous with Avon.
-The Teath, is also composed of two branches, which join
near the village of Callander, and take the name of Teath.-
Although this name be lost upon its junction with the Forth,
the Teath is a much more beautiful river than the other, and
discharges double the quantity of water.-The Forth and
Goody are of a dark colour, with a muddy bottom; the fish
in both are of the same kind, viz. pike, perch and cel.-In
the Teath are salmon, sea-trout, various species of fresh wa-
ter trouts, muscles and a few perch.-The salmon is the only
fish carried to market, and for fishing whcih any rent is drawn,
and even this is very trifling.-Their prices are regulated by
those of Stirling market, which are very variable, but upon the
whole, are supposed to be more than double of what they
were 10 years ago*.

another 84, and the wife of the latter 91; there is also a more singular felic-
ty in the lot of this pan, than their long life; they have been married 58
years; their family, including children, grand children, and servant, con-
sists of 13 persons; at an average, it is reckoned to have consisted of 10 per-
sons, yet, in that long period, no member of the family has died.

*Pearls are sometimes found in the useles, but not in such numbers, or
of such value, as to induce the proprietors of the water to exact a rent for
the privilege of fishing them.-  This circumstance has perhaps contributed
to prevent the fishing from becoming as valuable as it is capable of, for it is
supposed that a considerable number of years are required for perfecting the
pearl, but the fishing being free, whenever any pearls of value are found, the
havock among the muscles does not cease, until they are almost extupated.
This was the case about 20 years ago, since which tune there has been no
fishing until very lately, when some pearls of a good size were found.
