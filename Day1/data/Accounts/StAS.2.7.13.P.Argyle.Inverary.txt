   Fungi.--The fungi abound in the woods, covering every rotten

ed as of frequent occurrence : -

   Woods.-In an economical point of view, the woods form a very
important feature in this parish.  They are extensive and valuable,
covering almost all the subalpine district.  The number of acres
enclosed cannot be ascertained with perfect accuracy ; but it is be-
lieved that they cannot be fewer than 9000 acres.  Perhaps 12,000
may be a nearer approximation to the truth.  Much of the ground
enclosed, however, has either never been planted or has ceased to
yield trees of any kind ; much of it is covered with brushwood,
heath, Vaccinium myrtillus, V. uliginosum, &c.  Much has also
been injudiciously managed, so that from the acres enclosed, a
great number must be subtracted as unproductive.
   The earliest plantations are said to have been made by the Mar-
quis of Argyle and the Earl, his son, who, in laying the founda-
tion of the plan for improving and beautifying this property, have
left evidence of the enlarged minds and cultivated taste they pos-
sessed.  The portions planted by them are said to be Dunchuaich,
the heights above the castle, the lawn, and the beech avenue at
the entrance to Glenshira.  The trees planted were principally
oak, Scotch fir, ash, beech, and plane.  The wages of the labour-
ers employed, as seen by a jotting of the operations then carried on,
which is dated 1674, were " 4d. or one peck of oatmeal per day."
   The next extensive plantation is supposed to have been of
Leachdan Mor, Dalchenna, &c. by Archibald Duke of Argyle,
who, in 1746, sowed and raised from seed the noble trees which
grow on these farms.  There is an individual now living in Glen-
aray who remembers that event, and points out a Scotch fir at the
west end of the Foal's Bridge, or Drochaig an tshearraich, as the
