     Of St. Vigeans.

Scotland, was the late Mr. John Wallace, merchant, and some
time provost of Arbroath, who began that business about the
year 1740; and for many years after that period, all that kind
of cloth manufactured in this part of the country centered in
his shop.  But now that business has been extended through
almost every town, village, and parish in the county, and is
now carried on to such an extent, that the very large sum of 
money brought into this country by that breach of business,
cannot be estimated without an inspection of the custom-house
books.  By information sent the writer of this, from the mas-
ter of the stamp-office in Arbroath, taken from his books, it
appears, that from November 1791 to November 1792, there
were stamped 1,055,303 yards of Osnaburgh and brown linen;
and that one-fourth part of that quantity was manufactured
in this parish.  The value of the above cloth was 39,660 L.
6 s. 10 7/3 d. Sterling.  The bounty paid by government is 1 d.
Sterling on each yard of Osnaburgh valued 6 d. and 1 1/2 d. on
each yard above 6 d. of price.

this parish has been frequently transferred since the year 1754.
One estate on the W. side of the parish, of about 300 acres,
was sold about the above period for less than 600 L., some
years after that it gave 1300 L.; soon after 2300 L.; after-
ward for 2500 L.; it is just now in the market, and 6000 L.
at least is expected for it.  Another estate, on the W. side,
but near Arbroath, consisting of 150 acres, was sold in 1765,
for 2300 L. and 3 years ago it gave 5800 L.  Another estate;
on the east side, of 363 acres, was sold about 30 years ago for
1200 L., soon after for 1400 L.; about 3 years ago it gave
4000 guineas.  A farm of about 800 acres on the W. side of
the parish, a part of which is moor, was feued about 20 years
ago, and divided by the proprietors into 2 farms; the whole
