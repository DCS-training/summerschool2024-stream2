pels, nor government churches in the parish, the great body of the
people being members of the Established Church.

Church in 1834 was 1234.
      There are no societies for religious purposes established, the
annual examinations and periodical visitations of the clergyman
being deemed, and justly deemed, sufficient for the purposes of re-
ligious instruction. These examinations are numerously and punc-
tually attended, and the visitations are looked forward to as the
means of cementing and promoting that intercourse and good feel-
ing which otght always to subsist between a clergyman and his pa-
rishioners.
     Education.--There are six schools in the parish, viz. the paro-
chial school, and five others taught by individuals, who have only
to trust to the fees they receive as a remuneration for their trouble,
there being no endowment, or even annual subscriptions made for
that purpose. Besides these, there are two schools taught by fe-
males, where girls are instructed in reading, writing, and needle-
work. The branches of instruction taught at the parish school
are, reading, writing and arithmetic mathematics and Latin, and
if required, Greek; the branches taught at the other schools are
reading, writing, and arithmetic. The school salary at Fordoun
is L. 35, 12s. 11d., and the amount of fees is annually about L. 15.
