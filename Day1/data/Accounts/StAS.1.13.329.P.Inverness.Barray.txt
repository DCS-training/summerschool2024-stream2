any of the same extent in any part of scotland.  In the middle
and south end are very high hills, and some flat;  the hills
are mixture of green, rock, and heath; and seem to be
better calculated for a sheep-walk, than for rearing black
catlle, but lie at too great a distance from market.
 
   Agriculture, Soil, etc.-Agriculture has been almost in-
variably the same here (as in most of the western isles) for
time immemorial, till within these last 5 years, when Mr 
Macneil, the proprietor, returned from visiting foreign 
countries, has begun to introduce the method used in the 
low country, as far as he thinks the soil and climate can 
admit of.  The soil in general is thin and rocky (except-
ing the north end, which is a mixed soil, and almost free of 
rock); there is also a great deal of sand, which is blown one 
way ot other with every gale of wind, so that a great part 
of the best corn land has been thus blown away, or covered 
with sand.  There is some meadow ground between the hills.
the ground here requires that the manure be thick laid,
in order to procure a tolerable crop; there are some mea-
dows that yield three successive crops with one coat of ma-
nure, viz.  one of potatoes, and two of oats.  The people
here use the plough for the most part; but in their rocky
ground they dig or turn up the ground with a kind of 
lever, which they call the crooked spade, and which Dr
Johnston has described in his tour through the Hebrides.
They lay their potatoes for the most part in lazy beds, in the 
following manner:-1 ft, They mark out a ridge of about 
four feet wide, then lay on the manure, and with a spade
cover it with earth taken out of the surrow; in this slate
it remains till the beginning of April, when they begin to 
plant the potatoes by means of a dibble, or pointed stick, 
with which they penetrate the earth thus laid on, (making 
a hole to receive the seed), then break the earth with a
