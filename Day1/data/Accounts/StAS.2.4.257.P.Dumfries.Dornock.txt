			DORNOCK.                             257

	The extent of the parish along the coast is about three miles; and
the shore is sandy and gravelly, mixed with cobbles or large stones.
The flowing of the tide is extremely rapid, forcing its way with a
rise of four or five feet water a-breast, which renders it quite un-
safe for strangers to cross the Frith at low water without a guide.

		II.--CIVIL HISTORY.
	Antiquities, &c.--A battle is said to have been fought at
Swordwell by the Scots and English, which ended in the defeat of
the latter. The date is unknown. There may be seen in the
church-yard two stones of a singular shape, resting on blacks of
the same materials, which are supposed to contain the ashes of the
commanders of the English army. A variety of interesting tomb-
stones are to be found in the burial-ground; in particular that of
the last of the curates in this place, which has a Latin inscription
in Sapphic verse, the first line of which is taken, with a slight al-
teration, from Hor. xxii. Ode of Lib. i. *

			III.--POPULATION.

               In  1801 the population was         691
                   1811,                           788
                   1821,                           743
                   1831,                           752

    Of the population in 1831, 230 are in the village of Dornock;
the remainder in the country.
1. Number of families in the parish,                           155
          of families chiefly employed in agriculture,          72
                      in trade, manufactures, or handicraft,    55
2. The average number of births yearly for the last seven years,16
                     of deaths,                                  7
                     of marriages,                               4

   The farmers in this parish are chiefly persons of considerable
intelligence; and on many subjects of general literature and
science they converse with surprising readiness and accuracy. Per-
severing and industrious, and adopting the most improved modes of
agriculture, they cultivate their lands with taste, and in a regular
rotation of crops; and in nothing does the face of the country ap-
pear more agreeably changed, than in the thriving hedge-rows and
snug enclosures that in every direction meet the delighted eye.
