sought and fell; and in, at some distance, a stone of granite,
20 tons in weight, stands almost erect, to commemorate it is
said, the death of one of his generals:  But that tyrant, it is
more probable, was slaim at Lumphanan, a village in the Mearns.

   In the church-yard of Meigle are the remains of the grand
sepulcural monument of Vanora, also called Vanera, Wanor,
and Guinevar, the British Helena, as her name, according to
Prideaux, imports.  This princess was the wife of Arthur,
who flourished in the 6th century, and whole history is in-
volved in fables.  In a battle between the army of that mo-
narch and the united forces of Scots and Picts, Vanora was
taken prisoner, and carried, along with other spods into
Angus, where she lived some time in miserable captivity on
Barry-hill.  Such is the doubtful account recorded in the
antient annals of this country.  The character of that unfor-
tunate personage has been drawn in the blackest colours.  She
has been represented as one who led a lascivious life, and held
an unlawful correspondence with Mordred, a Pictish king,
which provoked the jealousy of her husband, and exicited him
to take up arms in revenge of the injury.  As a punishment 
of her enormous crimes, it is added, she was torn in pieces
by wild beasts; her body was buried at Meigle, and a monu-
ment erected to perpetuate her insamy.  Whether this detail
be genuine, or has arisen from the symbolic characters on the
stones, it is impossible to determine.

   That monument seems to have been composed of many
stones artfully joined, and decorated  with a variety of hiero-
glyphical or symbolical characters, most of which are of the
monstrous kind, and represent acts of violence on the person
of a woman.  On one stone are three small crosses, with many
animals above and below.  On another is a cross adorned.
