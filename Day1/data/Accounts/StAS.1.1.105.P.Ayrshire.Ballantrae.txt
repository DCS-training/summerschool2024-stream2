island, called the Lady Isle, in the bay of Air.  The shore
all along that part of the coast is flat and  sandy; the bay is
deep, and the entrance into the harbours strait and difficult.

   Surface, Soil, etc.-The land in this parish rises with a
gradual slop from the shore to the tops of the mountains,
which form part of that extensive range of hills that stretches
across the south of Scotland, almost from the Irish sea to the
Frith of Forth beyond Edinburgh.  Near the shore the soil
in general is a light, dry, hazle mould, upon a gravel bottom,
and for the most part but thin.  The surface is much diver-
sified with heights and hollows, intersected with a great num-
ber of little streams of water descending from the hills.  All
beyond the mountains is a soft mossy ground covered with
heath, and a thin long grass called ling by the country peo-
ple.  'Even below the mountains, heath is the prevailing ap-
pearance, excepting where the ground has been in tillage, or
immediately upon the shore, where there is some very fine
natural grass.  The ground is in general adapted to the 
breeding and feeding of black cattle and sheep, and is uni-
versally applied to that purpose, excepting the grain which
the inhabitants raise for their own use.

   Population and condition of the People.-There are 770 in
the parish, and of these about 300 are in the village.  The
annual number of births is 18.  The number of deaths
cannot be so well ascertained, as it is but of late years that a
register of them was kept at all, and even that not accurate-
ly, and the marriages still less.  The marriages, as would be
expected, from the situation and habits of life of the peo-
ple in the country, are, in general, prolisic.  Instances are
to be met with of a woman bearing fourteen children
to one  husband.  The average of births to each mar-
riage may be taken at six.  The inhabitants are lodged
