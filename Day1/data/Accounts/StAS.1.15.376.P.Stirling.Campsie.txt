   Appearance of the Inhabitants, and Diseases.-The inhabi-
tants of this district may be considered as uncommonly
healthy; they are a clean limbed, well made people, rather
lean of flesh, in general from five feet seven to six feet high;
one half of the young men being above five feet ten, scarcely
any above six feet: There are a few who live to a very great
age; although, in general, the heads of families live to the age
of seventy; which circumstance would induce me to style
the place more healthy than if we found extraordinary in-
stances of longevity: there is one circumstance to be taken
notice of, which is, the uncommon number of accidental
deaths, being somewhat more than two per annum; during
the last ten years there were no fewer than twenty three.+

   Of course, one eighteenth part of the deaths in this parish
may be styled accidental; and if we were to carry back the
calculation for thirty years, there would be found the same
proportion
