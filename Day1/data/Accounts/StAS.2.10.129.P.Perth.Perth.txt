	sick and diseased poor, by furnishing them with necessary advice
	and medicine-inoculation for cow-pox to all who might apply,
	without regard to recommendation, and the delivery of poor preg-
	nant women.  For the proper administration of the institution,
	rules and regulations were drawn up, and medical officers and a com
	mittee of management were appointed.  Annual reports have been
	regularly made to the stated meetings of the institution, and these
	have been most flattering and satisfactory.
	  In January 1834, it was resolved, after mature deliberation, to
	adopt, in addition to the charity, the self-supporting system, which
	has been introduced with so much advantage in England, with
	the view of extending the usefulness of the institution, and ena-
	bling the honest and industrious mechanic or labourer, by means of
	a trifling weekly payment, to procure for himself, his wife, and his
	children, that medical advice and medicine which be would other-
	wise be unable to obtain, without resorting to the aid of public or
	private charity.
	   The following table of results for the last year may serve to give
	a view of the operations of the Dispensary.  The patients admit-
	ted were as follows:

	   Total of pauper patients 661, and 31 of free member patients,
	giving the number 692 cases during the season.
	   There is a separate establishment from the above, but with the
	same designation.  It originated in a disapprobation of the Dis-
	pensary's adoption of the self-supporting system in 1834.  It em-
	braces no other object than the relief of the necessitous poor.  It
	has not as yet published any table of results.

	   Infirmary.-The erection of an Infirmary in Perth has been
	long desired and long contemplated.  It is now in progress.  Funds
	to the extent of about L. 5000 have been realized, and the building,
	agreeably to an approved plan drawn by Mr Mackenzie, architect,
	is  advanced.  When finished, it wilI be capable of receiving
	fifty-six patients.  The foundation was laid on the 5th of October
	last, by the Right Honourable Lord Kinnaird, with masonic honours.
