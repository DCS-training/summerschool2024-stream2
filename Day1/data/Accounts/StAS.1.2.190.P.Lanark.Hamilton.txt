lays down land to rest, without sowing the seeds of some o
these plants upon it.  The produce of hay is from one to three
tons per acre, besides an after growth, which is generally pas-
tured on, or cut for green food, the autumn being seldom fa-
vourable for making it into hay.  But red clover never continues
vigorous in the ground, for more than two years at the utmost.
Of late, rye-grass frequently dies after producing one crop,
and the other plants, above mentioned, diminish in size; so that
after one crop of hay, the land is generally brought to such per-
fection here, as in some parishes to the westward; but there
are people who make cheese and butter of a very good quality,
and the produce of a cow, well managed in that way, will
yield about L. 4 per annum.  The profits on fattening are
fluctuating, and depend on the rise and fall of the markets
for lean and fat cattle:  but fattening, being attended with less
trouble and expence than the conduct of the dairy, is preferred
by some people, and, upon the whole, is frequently full as ad-
vantageous.  It is farther to be observed, that graziers here
give a higher rent for pasture, when they are at liberty to feed
black cattle upon it, than when they are confined to pasture it
with sheep.
   Little flax is sown, except for private use.  At times, some
people have made greater adventures, and put in for the pre-
miums offered by the Trustees, not always without success:
But the care and attention, requisite to make the culture of
flax advantageous, have never been regularly pursued in this
parish.  Some of the farmers formerly sowed a little hemp,
which they afterwards made into ropes for domestic use; but
their time being now taken up with other articles, that prac-
tice is laid aside.
   *The modes of cultivation, and rotation of crops, are so vari-
ous, that it is impossible to give any idea of the average quantity
