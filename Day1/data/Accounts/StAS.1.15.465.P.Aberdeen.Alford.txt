lands, those only which are manured in this way, do by no
means stand in need of a claying every three years.  All our
farmers are most miserably defective in that grand requisite
in good farming, the raising of manure; for the whole dung
made on a farm in one year, even with the addition of muck-
fail or clay, is barely sufficient for manuring one seventh, or,
at most, one sixth of the land which produced the straw.  All
attempts to discover marle have hitherto proved unsuccess-
ful; and the only sactitious manure which has been tried in
this country is lime; and as trials of it have been made to a
very considerable extent, there is no doubt of the practica-
bility, and value of the improvement.  The late Mr Innes
of Breda, by liming and inclosing, accompanied by proper
husbandry, improved a property in this parish in twenty years,
which was lately sold at triple the price he paid for it.; nor
are there wanting instances of proprietors, and even of ten-
ants, though above the ordinary level, who have, with equal
advantage, carried on similar improvements.  The expence,
however, though the returns with good management, in the
long run, do much more than repay it, is very great.  The
cheapest method of procuring lime, is to bring it from Aber-
deen, at the distance of from 25 to 30 miles: At that port
the price is very high; for all the lime-shells imported there,
are either from the Sunderland lime-works, in the North of
England, or those at Charlestown, in the Frith of Forth, which
belongs to Lord Elgin.  Lime-shells, from the first give 3 re-
turns; and of the last from 2 to 2 1/4 of flaked lime.  The
Aberdeen boll of lime-shells is four corn firlots, or 128 stan-
dard Scotch pints ll, for which the merchants receive from
3 s. 1 d. to 3 s. 3 d. for Sunderland, and from 2 s. 7 d. to 2 s. 9 d.
for Charlestown shells.  The carriage from Aberdeen to this
