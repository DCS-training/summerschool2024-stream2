   Character.-The labouring people in the country, in gene-
ral, are very sober and industrious.  Those in the town, are
of the same character as in other towns along this coast.  It
is to be regretted, that the depopulation of the country, by
banishing cottagers into towns, has so much prevailed every
where of late; by which the breed of men is enervated, their
morals corrupted, and the strength of the state impaired.  It
is from the temperate and healthy family of the country la-
bourer, or tradesman, and not from the loathsome sink of a
town, that the race is to be fought, who are to cultivate our
fields, or defend our property in the time of danger.  In ge-
neral, the character, of charity may with great justice be
ascribed to the body of the people here; so that no subject of
distress can be long without relief voluntarily offered.  And
perhaps, in a moral view, the encouragement of THIS VIRTUE
may be none of the least arguments against the establishment
of poor's rates.  For the exercise of private chartity, and com-
passion, must always decline where there is a public assessment.
