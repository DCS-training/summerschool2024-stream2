mon field pease, likewise, are not raised here, though, from
the nature of the soil along the shore, they might prove a be-
neficial crop.  Oats are, in general, a very unproductive
crop, the greatest average returns are not above two and a-
half.  Potatoes and barley are more productive, and, were the
ground properly managed, might prove very valuable crops.
The system of farming here, has made very slow advances to-
wards improvement, and is, at least, half a century behind
that, in many parts of the low country.  The farmer does
nothing to his grounds all the summer.  Although there is plen-
ty of lime-stone on the opposite shore of Knapdale, and in the
adjoining island of Ilay, and plenty of peat in Jura, for burn-
ing lime, yet no person remembers a single trial made of that
manure.  The only manure used is the sea-wend, which is to
be had in great abundance, and gives one tolerable crop.  This
answers the contracted views of the farmer, who keeps the
best patches of his ground constantly in tillage, and labours
like one who is not certain of his possession beyond the pre-
sent year.  The farmers of this country are utter strangers to
the mode of abridging labour.  It is no uncommon thing to
see 12 men and 20 horses at work in a farm, which 3 men
and four horses would, on an improved plan, labour to much
better purpose.

   Quadrupeds, Birds, etc.-The same animals are cows, hor-
ses, sheep, and goats.  The small tenants, in general, over-
stock their grounds, so that the black cattle are rather small,
and inferior to those of Ilay.  The horses also, though hardy,
are very diminutive breed.  The sheep of Jura are remarkable
for the fineness of their wool, and the delicacy of their flesh.
Were proper care taken to keep this breed from degenerating,
by mixing with the Galloway sheep now introduced into the
island; were it allowed to increase, and cover the greatest part
