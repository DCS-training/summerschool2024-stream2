     of Tulliallan.

and the greatest part of it has been enclosed with stone dikes,
or hedges, which last have succeeded amazingly well.  As
the farmers are diligent in procuring dung from the village of
Kincardine, and lime from Lord Elgin's lime quarries, at a
considerable expence, and are assiduous in cultivating their
farms, they generally have good returns of wheat, barley,
oats, beans and pease, potatoes, turnips, and sown grass.
Were not the tenants restricted by their leases, the quantity
of oats sown would be less than any other grain, owing to
the high thirlage.  If a tenant carries 11 bolls of oats to the
mill, he may lay his account with leaving one behind him as
dues; I had almost said 1 in 10; which is very discouraging
to the improvement of lands.

   River, Climate, and Disease.-Surrounded by the river
Forth on the S. W., exposed to a free current of air in this
direction, and well sheltered by the elevation of the ground,
and the adjacent woods on the N. and E., this parish pos-
sesses, at all seasons, a more mild and temperate climate than
many other parts of Scotland, in the same latitude.  Violent
inflammatory diseases, depending on the qualities of the air, are
seldom seen here,excepting the croup among infants, which
prevails most in cold and damp situations.  During the course
of the last 20 years, the small pox (the most fatal disease in
this district), has been observed to become epidemical every
second or third year, often preceded by the chincough, and
followed by the measles.  The scarlet fever, thrice on one
occasion was ushered in with all the symptoms of the malignant
sore throat; and the dysentery once in August 1784, which,
at its commencement, was, in several instances, fatal.  With
these exceptions, infectious fevers are very uncommon.  Agues,
formerly prevalent, have not appeared these many years,
owing, in some measure, to the improvements in agriculture,
