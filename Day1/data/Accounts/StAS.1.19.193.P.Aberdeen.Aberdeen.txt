     of Aberdeen.

   Mr James Thain, merchant in Aberdeen, about three
years ago, made over to trustees named by him L. 400 Ster-
ling; the interest he appoints as a salary for a master, who
shall teach the children of the poor of this city reading,
writing, and arithmetic, and instruct them in the principles

and the worthy founder, who is still alive, frequently visits

management of contributors.  Dr Gordon, the present
physician, has had the charge of it for ten years.
   The utility of the institution to the poor will appear

   But it is calculated to be extremely useful in other re-
spects; namely, as being an excellent school for the educa-
tion of medical students, and on account of the ample field
it presents for observation, and the acquisition of practical
knowledge, affording, of course, the best of opportunities
for improving the science of medicine.  To make it useful
in all these respects has been the study of the present in-
cumbent, and the public will judge of his success from the
annexed tables.
   His success is very conspicuous in acute diseases, but
especially in severs.  What led to this success was the fre-
quent occurrence of that class of diseases; for other diseases
occured only occasionally, but severs constantly.  The
