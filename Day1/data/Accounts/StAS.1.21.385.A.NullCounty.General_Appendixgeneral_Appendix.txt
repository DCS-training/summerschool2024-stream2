   How far this calculation is just, can only be proven by an
actual survey of Scotland.  From the four volumes already
published of Sir John Sinclair's Statistical Account of Scot-
land, it appears, (after making allowance for those returns
which give no account of the number of parishioners,) that
there may be an increase of 150 in each parish of North Bri-
tain; which multiplied by 910, the number of parishes, pro-
duce 136,500, the total increase in these parishes.  But as the
great towns have increased considerably above 150 to each
parish of which they are composed; therefore,

of additional increase in the great towns; which increase, it
is presumed, will not be less than that in the great towns by
actual survey.
   In a calculation, instituted, about a twelvemonth ago, for
the purpose of finding the number of inhabitants in Edin-
burgh and its environs, exclusive of Leith, I was obliged to
make a few bolder suppositions than in the above investiga-
tion; being only possessed of the bills of mortality, in the
Gray-Friars, for the year 1780, and of the probable number
