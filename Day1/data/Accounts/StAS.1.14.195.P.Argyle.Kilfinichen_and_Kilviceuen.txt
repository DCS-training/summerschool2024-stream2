ground, the potatoes are laid upon the sea-ware, and co-
vered with earth from the surrows.  The potatoes
growing from this mode of management, are generally
wet and spongy.  Potatoes are planted in dung in this
last mode.  Few in the parish drill their potatoes.

   Measure and Price of Grain.-The whole produce of
Ross, the island of I, and the rest of the Duke of Argyll's
property, is sold by the peck.  A peck by which barley is
sold, and sometimes oats, is streaked, and contains up-
wards to 10 Scotch pints.  Another peck by which oats are
sold heaped, and meal streaked, contains 6 Scotch pints.
Potatoes are sometimes sold by the barrel, and sometimes by
the peck.  In other parts of the parish, different measures
are used.  It is among the great desiderata in the king-
dom, a uniformity of weights and measures.  Without
this, it is impossible to form a comparison between the
price of grain, and the seller is as much in the dark as
the buyer.  The boll of small oats sells from 8 s. to 10 s.
The meal it produces in Ross is about 4 stones weight.
The barley of I is sold from 16 s. to 20 s.  It meals about
12 stones.  The rest of the barley of the parish is gene-
rally sold at 20 s. the boll, and meals about 16 stones
weight.  Potatoes in good years sell from 20 d. to 2 s.
the barrel:  At seed-time, in bad years, such as 1791,
they rose to 5 s. the barrel.  Meal imported into the parish
is from 16 s. to 20 s. the boll of 8 stones, and cannot often
be got in the parish at that price, so that such as want are
obliged to send a boat, or horses for it, to a distant quar-
ter, at a considerable expense.  The meal imported into
the country is from Clyde, and besides prime cost in that
part, commission money, freight, and whatever profit
the mealmongers choose to charge, is added.  So little
