   The name which in modern days has reflected the greatest lustre
on this parish is that of David Macbeth Moir, Esq. the distin-
guished "Delta" of Blackwood's Magazine, who, amidst all the
harassing duties of the medical profession, has found time to em-
body in many chaste and touching strains, those "high imagin-
ings" which visit the mind of genius; as well as to stray into
the paths of richest and broadest humour--witness "Mansie
Waucb's" irresistible drolleries;--whose laborious history of the
art which be has himself so successfully studied, forms a most valu-
able acquisition to the practitioner;--whose songs in the recent re-
publication of Burns's Lyrics with music, take a deserved place
beside those of the illustrious national minstrel;--of whose genius
the fruits are to be found scattered over every department of perio-
dical literature; and who, with the gifts of genius, has none of those
defects of character which have too frequently sullied the bright-
est talents.
   Parochial Registers.--The earliest entry in the parish records
is 1607. They have been pretty regularly kept since that period.
The penmanship of many of the early registers is curiously ornate
and beautiful; but from inattention several of the volumes have
been much injured in consequence of getting loose in the binding.
They consist of four sets, and contain the following number of vo-
lumes: Minutes of Sederunt, 5 volumes, commencing at 1651;
Baptisms, 13 volumes, commencing at 1607; Proclamations, 5
volumes, commencing at 1690; Deaths, 6 volumes, commencing
at 1751.
   Modern Buildings.--The only building of a modern date worthy
of notice is the new church of North Esk, the plan of which was
furnished by William Burn, Esq. It is a handsome structure,
finished in the interior with much elegance and taste, and is capa-
ble of containing 1000 worshippers. The expense of its erection
amounted to L. 2500, which, with the exception of a grant of
L. 375 from the General Assembly's Fund, and L. 200 from the
Presbytery of Dalkeith, was raised by subscription. It was opened
for public worship on the 9th September 1838.
