drawn from either humanity or from interest can prevail with
them to adopt a measure which in every respect appears
so reasonable.  A process is said to be at present depending,
which will in the issue certainly determine how far custom, in
regard to hill dykes, is to be considered as the law of the
country.  But in whatever way the law may determine this
point, we, from a sincere regard to the interests of the coun-
try, cannot help wishing that the custom of the district, in
regard to this matter, would yield to the statute for herding
of cattle.
   Formerly there are said to have been near 3000 sheep in
the island, and now, owing to a variety of causes, they do
not exceed the half of that number.  The black cattle a-

an infectious disorder having some years ago entered the pa-
rish, and in a few months carried off great numbers of them.
As there are few evils but what produce some good, this
disorder, which the people at the time had good reason to
consider as a misfortune, may, it is likely, in the end, turn
out to their advantage, in so far as it has compelled them, in
spite of their aversion to novelties, to employ oxen instead of
horses.  To the regret of all good farmers, swine are raised
here in vast numbers; and what adds much to the evil, they are
under the very worst of management.  In the summer season
they are driven to the hill with the sheep and young cattle,
where they commit depredations without molestation; and
at the end of harvest, when the fruits of the earth are re-
moved, they come down in legions, fierce and hungry, and
are allowed to roam at large around the shores, to the almost
utter destruction of some of the best land of the island.
