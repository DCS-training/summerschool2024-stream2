   Medical Society.-In the year 1789, twelve young men, who
were engaged in the study of medicine in Aberdeen, formed them-
selves into a society for their mutual improvement, by meeting to
discuss questions connected with medical science.  Of these only
four are now alive, viz. Sir James M'Grigor, Bart, the present ac-
tive and enlightened Director-General of the Medical Department
of the Army; Dr John Grant, who has been for some years resi-
dent at Forres; Dr Colin Allan, at present settled in Nova Scotia;
and Dr James Moir, who has been long established as a practi-
tioner in Aberdeen.
   Their meetings were, for a good many years, held in one of the
class-rooms of Marischal College, and subsequently in apartments
hired for the purpose; and the additions made to their numbers
by the accession of new members, both increased the usefulness of
the society and testified the advantages that were derived from the
discussions and examinations held at their meetings.  ln l791, the
commencement was made of a library devoted to medical litera-
ture, and by donations from the members and their friends, as well
as by the purchase from time to time of such works as their funds
enabled them to procure, the collection gradually increased, so that
it became necessary, in order to protect their books, as well as that
they might have convenient apartments to hold their meetings in,
to endeavour to obtain the means of erecting a house for the pur-
poses of the society.  A subscription for this purpose was accord-
ingly commenced in 1809, and by the unremitted exertions of Sir
James M'Grigor, very considerable additions were made to this
fund during the subsequent years.  It was not, however, till 1818
that the society found themselves in a condition to undertake the
work of erecting the Medical Hall in King Street, which was com-
pleted in 1820, and has been since that time occupied by the meet-
ings of the society, and the library and museum belonging to it.
   When the society, during the collection of this fund, began to
acquire property to a considerable amount, it was deemed requisite
to provide for its security by vesting it in trustees, and a deed was
accordingly drawn up in 1815, by which the Principal and Profes-
sors of Marischal College were appointed to this office, and the con-
stitution of the society, both at that time and subsequently, under-
went certain alterations, which change of circumstances seemed
to render necessary.  It embraces now two classes of members,-
the one consisting of practitioners, mostly resident in or near Aber-
deen, who meet once a month for the communication of profes-
