into the narrow bays and creeks, are there inclosed by
nets, which are hauled upon the beach by the aid of cap-
stans, where after curing what may be required for the
market, tho rest by millions, are immediately boiled down
into oil, in cauldrons erected for that purpose on the shore,
To the circumstance, of the herrings not having spawned
for several years par upon this part of the coast, must in a
great measure be ascribed the want of haddocks, which
formerly used to be caught here in great quantities.  About
eight or ten years ago, the price was 2 s. 1 d. the long hun-
dred, i.e. 132.  At present, if one or two happen to be
caught, they are greedily bought for 4 d. or 6 d. a-piece.
The fisheries of great cod and skate are still good, but very
precarious for open boats, as the belt riffling ground lies far
off shore.  About 20 or 25 thousand lobsters are sent e-
very year to the London market.  Ten years ago, there
was double the number.  The price is L. 12, 10 s. the
thousand.
