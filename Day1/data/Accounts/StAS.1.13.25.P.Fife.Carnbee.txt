labour with horses, and seldom above 2 to a plough.  The old
Scots plough is still used by some, but in geneal those of
a more modern construction are preferred.  They have
sown for some time past, at an average, about 350 bolls of
wheat, 360 of barley, 300 of pease and beans, and up-
wards of 900 of oats; every few tares, and no rye.  Upon
every farm, you see a field of turnip, and even those, who
do not in common use them for the purpose of feeding
for the butcher, find great advantage in giving a few of
them every day during the winter and spring to their young
cattle, and milk cows.  Every farmer sows a considerable
quantity of clover and rye-grass; were it not for this and
his turnip crop, it would be impossible for him to keep his
farm in good heart.  I here are no sheep bred in the parish
for the market; but in the beginning of this century, there
were some thousands.  The few fed in it at present, during
the spring, summer, and harvest months, are all for the
use of private families.  There are nearly two-thirds of
the whole parish inclosed and subdivided; and those who
let their parks from year to year to the graziers, generally
draw from L. 1, 5 s. to L. 2, 5 s. the acre.  Considerable
quantities of flax-seed are sown here, but it does not com-
monly yield a plentiful return, excepting in the north part
of the parish.  Potatoes are raised in great abundance upon
every farm; they seldom export any; at an average.  It is  
supposed every farmer raises from 20 to 60 bolls of this
most useful root.  Last crop, however, owing to the wet-
ness of the harvest, they had scarce a third of their usual
increase.  When their horses are not at hard work, they
commonly give them one feed a-day of potatoes,which
it is thought has a fine effect in keeping the belly open.
They were wont to boil the potatoes, but now generally give
then raw, and think they do fully as well in that state.  Some
