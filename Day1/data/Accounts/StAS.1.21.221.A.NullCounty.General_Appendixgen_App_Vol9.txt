     The Statistical Account.

foxhunters in the country attend, and produce before the
court all the fox ears they have, with the attestations afore-
said; and after every examination that may be thought ne-
cessary, and their deposition to the truth of the facts con-
tained in their attestations, they receive their money in full.
The man that kills the greatest number receives a premium,
over and above the modified allowance for each fox.
   This county has taken this measure to extirpate the fox
for many years past; and if the neighbouring counties of
Ross and Caithness would adopt the same measure, this
county would soon get rid of that pernicious vermin, and
so would these counties too: But so long as they are al-
lowed to live and breed in the neighbourhood, this county
cannot by any means get totally rid of them.
   There is likewise a premium for killing the eagle, because
it is destructive of the lambs and kids.  It is said that it kills
grown deer, and if so, no doubt it will kill the young ones.
As it is difficult to kill the eagle by shooting, several of them
are killed by stratagem: the method taken is this-A minia-
ture house, at least the wall part of it, is built on ground
frequented by the eagled and an opening left at the foot of
the wall sufficient for the egress of the bird.  To the outside
of this opening a bit of strong skainy is fixed, with a noose
formed on one end, and the other end running through the
noose.  After all this operation is finished, a piece of carrion
is thrown into the house, which the eagle finds out, and
perches upon.  It eats voraciously; and when it is fully sa-
tiated, it never think of taking its flight immediately up-
wards, unless disturbed, provided it can find an easier way to
get out of the house; for it appears that it is not easy for
it to begin its flight but in an oblique direction; conse-
quently it walks deliberately out at the opening left for it,
and the skainy, being fitly contrived and placed for the
