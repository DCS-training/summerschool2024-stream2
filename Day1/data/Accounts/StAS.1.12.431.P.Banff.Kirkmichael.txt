and genial.  The disorders consequently to which they are
subject, may, in a great measure, be attributed to their cli-

   Soil, Springs, Natural History, etc.-As the face of this
country rises into hills, or sinks into valleys, as it slopes into
declivities, or extends into plains, the soil accordingly varies.
Along the banks of the Avon, and the brooks, it generally

moss and gravel.  In some few places, it is deep and clayey.
In the parish, there are several springs of mineral waters:

during 4 months of the summer and autumn seasons, affords
pasture for a 1000 head of cattle.  This forest is the pro-
