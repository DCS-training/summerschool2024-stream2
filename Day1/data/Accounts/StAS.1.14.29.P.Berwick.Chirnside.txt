     Of Chirnside

withoutany other expense but that of the ploughing,
and without abstracting above 2 or 3 days of his earn-
ings throughout the year, can raise, in crops of corn,
potatoes, turnips of clover, what is, at least, of 5 l. va-
lue to him, and what he could not obtain with that mo-
ney.  The maintenance of his cow, through the winter,
that most necessary article attained by him, is done equal
to 25 s. or 30 s. of that sum.  All the other labour his
little field requires, is performed by him, and his wife
or family, at spare hours.  The difference between him
and the artificer is, that he does no daily work at home,
and yet is confined, within a certain distance, for his
employment; and therefore he engages himself, at a
low daily wage, for the whole year, unless he can de-
pend upon having jobbs of weekly work in continu-
ance.  Excepting the smiths and weavers, the other ar-
tificers and trades people can easily change their abodes,
where they have not made purchases of houses; as they
have, so generally, done in Chirnside, from the encou-
ragement given them, joined to the facility and cheap-
ness of the quarries*.

the large farms into smaller ones, eith leases only of a moderate extent
the population in the parochial districts will emulate that of the village;
and in the respects that have been mentioned, its increase will be prefer-
able to it.  That the proprietors for this public advantage to be consistent
with their particular interest, appears by the subdivisions already made in
some of the greater farms of the parish. Like all other matters that have
a natural course, this measure cannot fail, gradually, to be followed; so
that, as it was found necessary, in the first improvement of land, that ei-
ther the heritors themselves should take large quantities of it into their
own hards for meltoration,or else let it extensively, in leases of many
