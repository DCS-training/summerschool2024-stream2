should be taken to improve it.  For some years past, the pro-
fits of the dairy have been great; and it may be said with
certainty (if we except the moor farms) that the rents of the
parish are, in general, paid from the butter and cheese made
in it.  The grazing farms in the parish, are employed either
in fattening Highland cows, to the extent of about 300, or
rearing up young ones, for the tenant himself, or for others,
and at the prices, from 12 s. to 15 s. for 1 year old, and from
20 s. to 24 s. for 2 and 3 year olds, and that from the 1st of
May to the 1st of November.  The sheep or heath farms in
the parish are but few; the stock of the whole amounting
to about 1200.  The sheep are of a small size, and the wool
not of a fine quality; when fattened, are generally sold to
the Paisley or Glasgow markets.  Few sheep are kept in the
low grounds since enclosing took place*.
