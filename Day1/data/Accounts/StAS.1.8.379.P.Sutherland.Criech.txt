dom, which the inhabitants of this happy island enjoy, under our
mild and durable constitution, the inhabitants of those estates
will enjoy perfect security, as occupiers of land.  That those
advantages will lead them gradually to better their houses, to
improve their lands, and to alter their own condition in every
respect for the better, is beyond a doubt.
   To calculate the advantages, which will in time accrue from
this system, to the owners of 18,000 acres of land, on which
it is introduced, would be no easy matter; but the following ob-
servations, will lead, perhaps, to the forming some idea of them.
Land lets, for potatoe grounds and other purposes, round
many  towns in Scotland, at various rents, from 1 L. upwards.
Manufacturers in Lancashire, and in some of the counties of
Scotland, pay for the little spots they occupy in the country,
round their own houses, from 1 L. to 4 L. Sterling per acre.
The cotton manufacture is laid to have doubled the rents of
Lancashire, within these last 20 years.  The demand for wood is
very great; and as all the woods on this estate, will be near a
navigable frith, the wood will fetch the current price, and be li-
able to little deduction, from the facility of carrying it to mar-
ket; while the practicability of being supplied with that article
from the Baltic, is said to lessen yearly.  The probable future
value of these estates, cannot be easily ascertained; but, we
know, that wherever industry has extended itself in Scotland,
the rents of land have risen at least threefold, and much more
in the neighbourhood of towns.  It is to be observed, that this
system is attended with no expence of any material conse-
quence, except that part of it, which consists in planting the
useless land; which, as it is considerable, (perhaps not less
than 3 L. per acre,) may either be omitted, or done on a smaller
scale and by slow degrees, according to the faculty and incli-
nation of the proprietor,
