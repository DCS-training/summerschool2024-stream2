     General Appendix to

pit-coal, which is wrought and produced at many places in
great abundance: but no coal has ever been discovered on
   From the situation of the various places where coal and
lime are produced, communication by water can be very ea-
sily opened, and in many places at little or no expence: to
the coal of Devon, by the tide-way of the Forth and the ri-
ver Devon; to the lime craigs of Lord Elgin, by the tide-
way and Frith of Forth; to the various coal works between
Stirling and Carron, by navigable canals from the river Forth;
and to the lime craigs of Aberfoil and Leny, by the naviga-
tion of the rivers Forth and Teith.
   This unfolds a very wide field for enquiry; and to ascer-
tain the cheapest and most profitable plan of improvement
would be very difficult, though a little time and expence
would infallibly accomplish the object.  In any view, the ad-
vantage of water communication would be great; and the
only point of enquiry is, which of the whole plans that can
be formed would be the most valuable.
   In the annexed copy of the procedure in 1774, relative to
the navigation of the Forth, Devon, and Goodie, a very ac-
curate description of these rivers is given.  For making the
Forth navigable above the tide-way, it appears 5,833 l. sterl
would have been requisite at that time, beside the value of
19 acres of land, occupied by cuts, etc. which may be valued
at 30 l. per acre, as the half of it would not be needed in
perpetuity: so, had the plan succeeded in 1774, the whole
of the Forth navigation to Gartmore would only have cost
6,403 l. Sterling.  The navigation of the Devon, including

several cuts, would have cos   L. 7,207 13 6
       Beside 59 acres land,      1,770  0 0

       In whole,               L. 8,977 13 6
