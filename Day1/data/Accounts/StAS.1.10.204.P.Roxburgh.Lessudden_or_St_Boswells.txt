     PARISH OF LESSUDDEN OR ST BOSWELLS.

     (Presbytery of Selkirk.-Synod of Merse and Teviot-
     dale.-County of Roxburgh.)

     By the Reverend Mr JOHN SCADE.

     Origin of the Name.

   A CONSIDERABLE village in this parish goes by the name
of Lessudden, which it is supposed to have got from its
having been once the residence of one Aidan, Bishop of Lin-
disfarne.  Lis being a Scoto-Celtic word, signifying residence,
Lis-Aiden, the residence of Aidan, by a careless pronuncia-
tion, might in time become what it now is, Lessudden.  Aidan
was educated in the monastery of Icolmkill, and is mentioned
in terms of respect by Bede, in his ecclesiastical history*.
St Boisil was a disciple of St Cuthbert, and for some time be-
longed to the monastery of Old Melrose, in the neighbour-
hood of this place.

   Extent, Productions,etc.-This parish, which is situated on
the banks of the Tweed, within 10 miles of Kelso, 5 of Mel-

*Such as are disposed to inquire farther into the life of
Bishop Aidan, may consult Dr Mackenzie's lives of the Scotch
writers, vol. 1. p. 359.  Bede, Hay's Reliquae Sacrae, and
Spottiswood's Church History.  But the more general name of
the parish, and the proper name of the church, is St Boswells,
from St Boisil a French monk, who is said to have founded it
about the beginning of the seventh century.
