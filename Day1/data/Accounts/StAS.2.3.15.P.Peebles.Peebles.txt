haps in the county, consisting of 450 acres, all arable, is let for
L. 625 a-year. The yearly rental of the parish is supposed to be
about L. 7000.
   Rate of Wages.-Female servants receive from L. 4 to L. 5 from
Whitsunday till Martinmas, and between L. 2 to L. 3 for the other
half year. Ploughmen, when lodged in their masters' houses, re-
ceive from L. 8 to L. 14 a-year. When married men, they are
paid in meal, money, a cow's grass, &c. Shepherds in this pas-
toral county have generally a certain number of grazings for sheep,
and their wages must therefore depend on the price of wool and
the value of sheep. Labourers during the summer are paid from
9s. to 12s. a-week: masons and wrights, 15s.
   The average gross amount and value of raw produce yearly rais-
ed in the parish as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows.

<TABLE>
Assuming that there are 3000 English acres, and that five years are the usual rota-
  tion, 600 acres will thus be annually allowed for each crop. An entire crop is
  seldom taken of one kind of grain, &c. as in the fourth and fifth break.

   Manufactures.-Much has been said against the want of enter-
prise and public spirit in the inhabitants not introducing manufac-
tures. The high price of coals is one obstacle; and, though there
is plenty of water, it might be difficult to procure another fall of
water in addition to that of the Tweed used for the corn-mills, and
that of the Eddlestone water for the waulk-mills. A maufactory
for carding, spinning, and making cloth, flannel, and plaiding to a
very considerable extent, has for several years existed. In the

<FOOTNOTE>No allowance is here made for deaths, which, in wet winters and barren springs,
are very considerable; the calculations, especially on the last two items, are probably
two high, as the total amount shews rather more than the usual proportion to the
rental.
