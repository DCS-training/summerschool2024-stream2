and flannel, especially the former, and sent mostly to the
English market.  The latter, which would have employed
about 20 persons, was soon hurt after its commencement,
and is now almost entirely ruined, by the iniquity of the
times.

   Fishing.-There is a small salmon fishing in the river of
Bladenoch, the rent of which has successively risen from
9 L. to 16 L., from 16 L. to 24 L., and from 24 L. to 33 L. Ster-
ling.  The salmon are not large; they are taken from the
beginning of March to that of October, and are in greatest
perfection in June and July.  They are generally sold,
when they begin to be taken, at 4 d., and afterwards at
3 d. the lb.  The inhabitants of Wigton have the privi-
lege of fishing salmon in a particular part of the water of
Cree, opposite to the town itself; and the fish taken there,
which are not very many, are much of the same size,
caught at the same time, and sold at the same price, as
those already mentioned.  Various kinds of white fish,
especially flounders, are taken in the bay of Wigton.  The
fishing, it is thought, might be turned to considerable ac-
count, but is very little attended to.

   Roads and Bridges.-The statute-labour, by which the
roads were formerly made, was lately, by act of parlia-
ment, converted into money.  The maximum, which has
hitherto been collected, is that of 15 s. for each 100 L.
Scotch of valuation, and half a crown for each labourer
and tradesman in the year.  With this fund, the roads are
getting fast into a state of repair, and are let to be kept
so for 10 years.  The bridges in the parish are upheld
from the county funds and are in excellent order.
