the consined air of this cave, the bones are still pretty fresh,
and some of the skulls entire, and the teeth in their sockets.
About 40 skulls have been lately numbered here.  It is pro-

   Seafaring, etc.-As to seafaring, the people appear fond

young men in Rum inlisted in the Breadalbane sencible re-

luxurious.  They live chiefly upon potatoes and herrings;
and among the more opulent tacksmen, a dish of tea and a
dram of whisky are their greater luxuries.

should maintain its present inhabitants.  Canna, Isle Muck,
and Rum, are not inconveniently situated, mutually to assist;

Rum might help the summer grazing of Canna and isle
Muck, and render their cattle fitter for market.  Canna and
Isle Muck might afford a surplus of crop to supply the inha-
