land filling with weeds when the hay crops are done out.

to pasture, for it is very seldom that our farmers are at
the trouble of scattering common hay seed on them, as
might be easily done, and much to their advantage.  These
errors are beginning to be seen and owned; the next thing
will be to amend them.

and sod, laid in rows, alternately.

is now building, which promises to be more convenient and
durable.
