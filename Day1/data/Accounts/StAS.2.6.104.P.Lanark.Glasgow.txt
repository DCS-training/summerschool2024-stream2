at nine o'clock; but here we have been enabled, from knowing the
state of the thermometer every hour, day, and night during the
year 1834, to give the average monthly for the year. This has
been obtained through the politeness of Mr Mackain, the scienti-
fic manager of the Glasgow Cranstonhill Water-Works Company.
Mr Mackain suspended one of Crichton's Fahrenheit thermometers
in an open well about twenty feet diameter, cradled with stone, in a
position apart from the rays of the sun, and gave in charge to the
day and night engineer, who are in constant attendance, to mark
the hourly state of the thermometer in a book; and from that book
Mr Mackain constructed a table, exhibiting the temperature hourly,
daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. The following is an abstract
from that laborious and most important document.

        The greatest height of the thermometer in June was 72&deg;, and
the lowest 46&deg;. In July 78&deg; and 54&deg;. In August 78&deg; and 49&deg;.
These extremes are applicable only to a few hours in the respec-
tive months. Average temperature at the Cranstonhill Water-Works
during, two years, viz. from Ist January 1833 to Ist January 1835,
48.43.
	The mean heat of Glasgow was formerly determined by Professor
Thomas Thomson to be 47&deg; 75', while that of Edinburgh, as deter-
mined by Professor Playfair, was 47&deg; 7'; but it is presumed that these
eminent philosophers had not the advantage of hourly inspection.
	In 1834 and 1835 the winters were so mild that ice was im-
ported from Iceland to Glasgow. This may account for the dif-
ference of temperature, as ascertained by Professor Thomson.
	Hydrography.--The city is bounded on the south by the Clyde,
and that river bounds the Gorbals on the north. The Barony pa-
rish is bounded on the west parts by the river Kelvin. The Forth
and Clyde, and the Monkland Canals, run through a considerable
park of it, and it contains the Hogganfield and Frankfield lochs,
which act as feeders to the town mills.
	Mineralogy.--The suburbs contain large quantities of coal, iron-
stone, limestone, freestone, whinstone, fhre and potters clay, and
