     of Westerkirk.

On the farm of Enzieholm, there are the remains of an old
fortification, of a triangular form.  It has the appearance of
great antiquity, and has undoubtedly been a place of very
considerable strength; but it is so much fallen into ruins, that
no probable conjecture can now be formed, either of the time
when it was built, or by whom it was possessed.  There are
vestiges of an old tower, or castle, at Glendinning, and the
remains of another at Westerhall.

   Wood.-About 50 years ago, the parish was much better
stored with wood than it is now.  From the S. E. end of it,
however, to about a mile beyond the church, there is a con-
siderable quantity of natural wood along the banks of the
Esk, and several thriving plantations on the estates of Craigs,
Dowglen and Westerhall; at the last of which places, there
are many very venerable ashes and plane trees.

   Diseases.-There are no diseases peculiar to the parish.
The rheumatism and tuberculous phthisis are, the most preva-
lent.  The practice of inoculation has, for many years, been
very general, and very successful.

think that they were places of strength, into which the inhabitants collected
their cattle, when alarmed with a visitation from the English Borderers; and
many are of opinion that they were formed for the purpose of protecting the
cattle, during the night, from the ravages of wild beasts, when this country was
mostly covered with wood.  The last of these suppositions seems to receive some
countenance from the following circumstances, that there is a burian on almost
every farm, end that its situation, in general, is on the first piece dry or rising
ground that is to be met with in the neighbourhood of the farm-stead, especially
when such a situation is rendered the more inaccessible, by the bank of the river,
or some other adjoining precipice.
