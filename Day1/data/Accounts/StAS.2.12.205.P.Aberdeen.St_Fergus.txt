meal, and one-half boll of bear for malt.  Day-labourers earn from
9d. to 1s. in winter, and from 1s. to 1s. 3d. in summer, with victuals.
Harvest fees are, for a man, L.2, and for a female reaper, L. 1, 10s.
with maintenance.  A wooden plough fully mounted costs L.3, 3s. ;
a good cart with wheels,  L. 10; a harrow with tines, L. 2, 8s.
Masons work here generally by the day at 1s. 6d. with victuals ;
tailors by the piece at from 5s. to 7s. for a coat, according to the
quality, Is. 6d. for a vest, and from 1s. 6d. to 2s. for a pair of
trowsers; shoemakers generally charge from 9s. to 12s. for a pair
of men's shoes ; blacksmiths work at the rate of 4d. per pound of
iron, the price of the material being included : peat-casters in the
season are paid by the leat of forty cart-loads, at from 17s. to L. 1
per leat, including the labour of spreading and setting the peats.
There are a few poor women who are employed in knitting stock-
ings and mits at from 2 1/2d. to 3d. per cut of worsted.  Others of
this class earn a subsistence by making brooms or heather besoms
at one halfpenny each.  This, latter trade affords a convenient
opportunity for poverty to plead its wants without assuming
the character of the professed mendicant, and in this way it yields
a competent income to the few who are engaged in it.

   Mills.-There are three mills mills in the parish, but to none of these
are any of the farms astricted or sucken, though the tenants on
Pitfour's property are bound by their leases to have their meal
made at some one of the mills on the proprietor's estate.  At the
Stone Mill a large quantity of meal, flour, and pot-barley is an-
nually manufactured by the tacksmen, the Messrs Clark, on their
own account.  In 1836, 1508 sacks of meal (of 2 1/2 cwt. each)
were sent to the London market, 314 do. to Shetland, and 200 do.
were sold at home.  In the same year 613 sacks of flour, and 100
do. of pot-barley, were made and sold for home consumption.
   Fishery.-The salmon-fishing on the Ugie has been much in-
