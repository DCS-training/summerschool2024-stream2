planted, it sold in 1790 for L. 1100 Sterling.  Thirty years
ago there was much heath towards the east; it is now green,
or yielding crops.  Sea-weed is thrown in plentifully by win-
ter storms, and much used in manuring land.  Marle, in the
higher grounds, is got in abundance, and is of great advan-
tage as there is little lime but what is imported from Ireland.
Oa sown from the end of February to the end of March;
pease and beans are sown in April; barley in May and June.
Wheat sown before winter is commonly first reaped, towards
the end of August.  The parish is scarcely able to supply it-
self with provisions, as appears from importations, and no
great decrease of price.  Little flax is raised, at least for sale.
A considerable quantity of artificial grasses is raised with
great success.  Most of the wood in the parish is young, but
thriving well.

   Population.-It appears from the records of the Sailors So-
ciety, that, when wine was imported at Air from France, the
population was much greater than at present.  When a plague
broke out here, near 200 years ago, according to tradition,
about 2000 died.  In 1745, the inhabitants were reckoned
about 2000.  The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, was 2964
fools.  Trade since that time revived, particularly tobacco
which added considerably to the population.  Inclosing
took place much about the same time; and in the years 1747,
1748, 1749, and 1750, the herring fishing was great:  Sailors 
coopers, etc were of course numerous.  Upon the whole,
the inhabitants have been increasing sensibly, though nor ra-
pidly, for more than 30 years past.  The number of examin-
able persons in the parish, reckoning from 7 years of age and
upwards, is above 3400.  Of these there are 3000 in the
town, and the remainder in the country.  The number of 
souls may therefore be stated at about 4100 souls.
