   Surface and Soil.-The parish is divided, length-ways, by a
ridge or bank of considerable height.  The ascent of this
bank from the south is easy; from the north it is steeper.
Contiguous, on the north side, lie the Haughs of Isla, con-
taining upwards of 600 acres of a strong clayey soil.  These
haughs produce excellent crops of corn and grass.  It fre-
quently happens, that, after northerly rains, the Isla is swell-
ed to such a degree, as to lay the adjacent banks and haughs
under water to a great extent; and, in time of harvest, these
inundations have been known to carry off large quantities of
corn.  Wherever the ground is elevated in any degree, the
soil is light and gravelly; in the low grounds the soil is either
of a clayey or loamy nature.  The Watton Mire is a common
of considerable magnitude, containing nearly 200 acres.  The
people of the parish were wont to repair thither for turf and
sods, which they used in part as feuel.  It is now totally use-
less in this respect.  Several overtures have been made to
have this common partitioned among the heritors, but none
have yet succeeded.  Were it drained, and sheltered with
planting, it might turn to advantage.  It now presents a
bleak and barren appearance in the heart of a rich corn
country.  The only plantation ground is in the west end
of the parish, containing from 50 to 100 acres of common
fir, the property of Lord Privy Seal.  In many places of the
parish and country adjacent, we meet with a red earth of a
clayey unctuous nature, commonly called mortar, and some-
times used in building.  It is found a few inches below the
surface, and reaches to a considerable depth.  Below this stra-
tum of red earth is found a soft stone of the same colour,
which is, evidently, the same earth in a consolidated form.

   Agriculture.-The lands are now generally inclosed with
thorn hedges.  Formerly, the distinction between Outfield and
