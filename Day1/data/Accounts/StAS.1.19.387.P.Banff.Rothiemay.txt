the opposite side of the river, rising, by a gradual ascent, to
a great height, form a beautiful rural scenery, equalled by
few, and perhaps excelled by none, of equal extent, in the
kingdom.

   Soil, Produce, Rent.-Plantations and natural woods oc-

chiefly of sir, birch, ash, elm, and aller*, which, in conse-

parishes, are sold at high prices, and bring the proprietors
from L. 100 to L. 200 a-year.  And it may be presumed,
that, some years hence, they will bring much more, as
many of them, especially firs, now young and thriving, will
then be ready for sale; and as the proprietors not only sup-
ply from their nurseries the places of those they fell, but
are carrying this kind of improvement still farther, by
planting such parts of their estates as are less fit for culti-
vation or pasture.
   The pasture bears only a small proportion to the arable
land of the parish.  It is such, however, as renders it pro-
fitable for some farmers to rear a few sheep, and all a few
black cattle, for the market.
   The soil, in general, is rich and fertile.  It produces ex-
cellent oats, bear, pease, and lint, the common crops of the
parish; and in such abundance, that large quantities, parti-
cularly of oats, oatmeal, and bear, are exported annually.
A great part of the bear finds a good market at distilleries
in the neighbouring parishes.  Part of it, as well as oats

particularly on the property of the Earl of Fife, whose example in planting,
and other improvements, is well entitled to the imitation of other proprie-
tors.  Some old ash, belonging to his Lordship, are of an uncommon size,
measuring, in diameter, four sect.
