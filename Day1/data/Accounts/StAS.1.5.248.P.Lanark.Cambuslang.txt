   About 40 years ago, oats were almost the only grain sown
here, the quantity of black stuff and barley being inconsi-
derable; and though there be still a greater number of
acres in oats than in all other kinds of grain, yet that num-
ber is daily diminishing.  All the oats raised at present are
not sufficient to supply the demands of the parish.  The
practice of sowing wheat was introduced about the year
1760, and since that time, the quantity sown has been gra-
dually increasing.  It is now the favourite crop with those
farmers, who possess that half of the parish which lies next
to Clyde.  Wheat is sown on all kinds of soil; but
the clayey, which id indeed the most common, is found to
answer best, because the crop suffers least by the frosty
nights and sunshine days in the spring.  Thr greatest part of
the wheat sown here is on summer fallow, and after 4 or 5
repeated plowings.  It is doing the farmers no more than ju-
stice to say, that they spare neither labour nor expence to
raise great crops of wheat; and, from the yearly increasing
quantity, it may be presumed, they find that their labour
and expence turn out to a good account.  Glasgow dung
is the principal manure employed for raising a wheat crop.
