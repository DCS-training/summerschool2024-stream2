     of Campsie.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-It may be here proper to men-
tion a remarkable fact, which marks very much the turbu-
lence of the times, and the impotence of the laws, so late as
they ear 1744.  The father of the present minister of Camp-
sie paid black mail to M'Grigor of Glengyle, in order to
prevent depredations being made upon his property; M'Gri-
gor engaging, upon his part, to secure him from suffering
by any hardship, as it was termed; and he faithfully fulfilled
the contract; engaging to pay for all sheep which were car-
ried away, if abone the number seven, which he styled lifting;
if below seven, he only considered it as a piking; and for the
honour of this warden of the Highland march, Mr John Lap-
ske having got fifteen sheep lifted in the commencement of
the year 1745, Mr M'Grigor actually had taken measures to
have their value restored, when the rebellion broke out, and
put an end to any further payment of black mail, and like-
wise to Mr M'Grigor's self created wardenship of the High-
land borders.
   The last instance in this district of a Baron of Regality
exercising the jurisdiction of pit and gallows over his depen-
dents, is said to have been exercised by the Viscount of Kil-
syth, in the 1793; having condemned one of his own servants
to be hanged for stealing silver plate from the house of Ban-
cloich: the fellow was executed upon a hill on the barony
of Bancloich, styled the Gallow-hill; a part of the gibbet
was lately found lying in a swamp, adjoining to this field of
blood.
   Lunardi, an Italian, the celebrated aeronaut, alighted from
one of his aerial excursions in Campsie; having ascended in
a balloon from St Andrew's church yard, in the city of Glas-
gow, upon the 5th of December 1785.  At two o'clock in the
afternoon, he descended in this parish, at twenty minutes
