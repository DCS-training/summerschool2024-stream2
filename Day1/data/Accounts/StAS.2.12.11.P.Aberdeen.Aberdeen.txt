	Generally speaking, the wind does not blow with any great
violence, and it cannot be said that there is any particular quarter
from which a violent wind may be expected to come, rather than
any other; though, perhaps, on the whole, the north wind may be
said here to be oftener a violent wind than that which blows in
other directions.
	The average rise of the tide at the mouth of the Dee is 13 1\2 feet
at spring tides, and 8 feet at neap tides, and the former takes place
when the moon is about thirty-six hours past the full and change,
-the latter about thirty-six hours after the first and last quarters.
        The magnetic variation is at present 26&deg; 43' westward. It was
a few years ago somewhat greater, having been stated by Mr In
nes at 26&deg; 45' during the years 1830-31-32-33, and 34.
	The aurora borealis is sometimes seen here in great splendour,
exhibiting a corona of every conceivable colour, and of very great
brilliancy from its rapid and constant changes. The hissing or
crackling noise which so many have heard accompanying this me-
teor, while many others have denied that any such sound has ever
been heard, (apparently for no better reason than because they
have not themselves heard it, and cannot account for it,) has been
occasionally observed by several persons in Aberdeen and the
neighbourhood, among whom the late Mr John Ramage may be
mentioned, as well as the writer of this Account, who also had an
opportunity once of confirming the observations made by Captain
Back during his sojourn in the Polar regions, that the cause of
this meteor, whatever it may be, is not always at so great a distance
from the surface of the earth as is commonly supposed, for he saw
the beam of light distinctly pass between his eye and a small cloud,
while it passed behind another small cloud, which evidently hung
lower in the atmosphere. The splendid phenomenon of a lumi-
nous arch, about 1&deg; 30' broad, stretching across the heavens nearly
in the direction of the magnetic equator, and slowly moving to-
wards the south till it becomds more undefined, and at last breaks
up when it has passed a little beyond the zenith, has been of late
years geveral times observed here. Nothing can be founded on
the frequency or unfrequency of a phenomenon so irregular and so
little understood as the aurora borealis; but it may be mentioned
by the way, that after having been for several years very seldom
observed, it has of late become much more frequent, and during
