     Statistical Account

   Horses.-There are in this parish about 347 horses; of which
ten or twelve at most are riding or carriage horses; the rest
are all for the purposes of agriculture.  There are some
few brood mares, but not one stallion; and although some
few horses are bred here, yet the principal supply is from 
the west country markets.

   Cattle.-There about 900 cows and black cattle in
this parish.  The cows are of various breeds, and of all
sizes; and although many calves are brought up, yet there
is perhaps too little attention shown to this species of farm-
ing.
   It has been a practice here with many farmers to take in
black-cattle from the higher lands, about the end of the
year, i.e. after Martinmas, and put them in their straw-
yard, where they continued, and got nothing but straw
through the winter, these were called winterens, and usually
paid from 6s. to 10s. per head, according to the size.  It
was formerly a practice in this parish to use oxen in the
plough; but not there is no such thing in the whole pa-
rish, except on the estate of Littletown; and though they
may be bred to go well either in the plough or car, per-
haps to as good purpose as horses, are much more easily
kept up, and when unfit for the farm can be fed to great
advantage, and will fetch a good price from the butcher;
yet it is found, that they are not so fit for the purposes of
farming in this country, as their feet are too tender, even
when well shod, for much work; and much carting upon
hard roads lays them up entirely.

   Sheep.-There are no sheep in this parish, but such as
are kept for the use of families, except upon the estate of
Mylnesield.  Mr Mylne keeps about 400 of the Bakewell
breed, and as near the original stock as he can procure
