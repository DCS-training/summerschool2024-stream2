they endeavour to dress themselves after the low country fa-
shion; the fashion, thus introduced, raises an emulation a-
mong the women in general and, of course, merchants are
encouraged to import like articles.  The periodical migration
of our young women to the low country in harvest, is entire-
ly with a view to dress.  They seldom bring home any share
of the price of their labour in cash, and they are a mean
of encouraging an extravagance of dress.  So intent are
they on this object, that from Whitsunday to Martinmas,
they will not accept of service at home; and, except the
few weeks spent in the low country, they are a burden to
their friends for this half year.  If manufactures, particular-
ly the woollen, were established among us, our young wo-
men might find constant employment at home, mutually ad-
vantageous to themselves and to the public.
   In this parish there may be about 1100 cows, about 540
stirks, and 500 two year olds.
