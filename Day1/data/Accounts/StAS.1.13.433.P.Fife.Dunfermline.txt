some time past been from L. 50,000 to L. 60,000 Sterling,
and the trade was on the increase.  Astonishing improve-
ments have been made within less than half a century in the 
art of weaving, and in the manufacture of table-linen:  By
the introduction of machinery labour has been greatly a-
bridged.  Formerly, in weaving diaper, two, and some-
times three persons, were requisite for one web; now, by
means of the fly-shuttle, and what is called a frame for rai-
sing the figure, a single weaver can work a web 2 1/2 yards 
broad without the least assistance.  Many of the tradesmen
in this place discover considerable genius in drawing figures 
for the diaper, and several of them have obtained premiums
for their draughts.  Table-cloths can be furnished of any
desired breadth, length, and fineness; and noblemen and
gentlemen may have their coats of arms and mottos
wrought into any table-linen they choose to commission. 
In the chest of the incorporation there is preserved a very
curious specimen of the weaving art:  It is a man's shirt
wrought in the loom about 100 years ago, by a weaver of 
this place of the name of Ingles.  The shirt is without seam,
and was finished by the ingenious artisan without the least
assistance from the needle; the only necessary part he could 
not accomplish was a button for the neck*.

   Town-Improvements.-In speaking of these, it would be
injustice to pass over in silence the name of Mr George Chal-
mers, late of Pittencriess.  To the enlightened and spirited 
exertions of this gentleman, in order to promote the seuing 
out of his lands, Dunfermline is indebted for one of its

for spinning yarn from flax, hemp, tow, and wool.  The yarn spun from
flax has given great satisfaction.
