     Statistical Account

The manse was built in 1756, and underwent a thorough
repair in 1790; but offices are paltry and ruinous.
The stipend, by decreet of locality in 1742, is 32 bolls of
barley, 32 bolls of oatmeal, and 38 l. 6 s. 8 d. in money.
The schoolmaster's salary is 100 merks Scots.  The num-
ber of his scholars is generally under 20.  The only
branches of education that are taught are, reading English,
writing, and arithmetick.  For the first of those, the
school wages are 14 d.; for the second 18 d.; and for the
third 2 s. a quarter.  The whole of the schoolmaster's in-

who receive, according to their exigencies, from 2 s. to 
4 s. 6 d. a month.  This monthly distribution is made from

mortcloths, etc.; and formerly, draughts upon a small
fund at inetrest, but that being lately exhausted, at pre-

the landlords and tenants.  Poor rates, like every other
thing, may be attended with some inconvenience.  They
may, in some instances, encourage idleness and avidity in
those by whom they are claimed, or peculation and ex-
travagance in those by whom they are administered.  But
it seems undeniable, that they posses this advantage, that
they proportion distribution to opulence, and force the
churlish to share equally with the charitable, the burden
of supplying the necessities of the indigent.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The only regular fund for
repairing the roads and bridges in the parish, is the statute
labour, which is converted at 18 d. for every ploughgate,
and which amounts to about 18 l. a year.  The length of
