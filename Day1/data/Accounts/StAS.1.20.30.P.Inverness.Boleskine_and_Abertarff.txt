August or September.  But as more than three-fourths of this 
parish is now covered with sheep, the number of black cattle
is proportionably diminished; and it may be safely compu-
ted, that there are now sold annually from this parish from
2000 to 3000 sheep and wethers.  Within the last 30 years,
the tenantry in general have run much upon potatoes, and 
in the country of Abertarf, this article of late years consti-
tues the principal part of their crop; and in Stratherrick,
although a hilly country, every tenant and cottar has a pro-
portion of his ground planted with this valuable root; and
it should also be recorded, that two heritors of this country,
having of late years been at considerable expence, in clear-
ing their grounds of stones, levelling the fame, by removing
the banks or interstices, vulgarly called merins, which ar
now frequently to be seen in the unimproved part of the
country, building dikes, etc. have also introduced a rota-
tion of crops; the first by sowing turnips, following that
with bear and grass-feeds; and it is to be hoped, that these
successful attempts will become hereafter an object of imi-
taion.-Mr Fraser of Gortuleg having about 4 years ago
imported a species of grain called red oats, brought from the
neighbourhood of Edinburgh, he has had such prosperous
returns, that most of the tenants in this country, to whom he
is so obliging as communicate what can be spared of the
produce, now prefer this grain to the black oats used by
their ancestors, as it is not only found to produce a redund-
ant crop of straw, but to ripen as early as the native grain
of the country; but it would appear from the trials made,
that this grain deteriorates in two or three years trial, and
therefore a triennial importation would seem proper and
necessary.  Mr Fraser has also inclosed several of his fields
with thorn hedges, which are in a thriving condition.
   The natural wood of this country is chiefly birch, allar,
and hazel; but from the great trunks found in all the
