     NUMBER XXXI.

     PARISH OF FYVIE,

     (COUNTY AND SYNOD OF ABERDEEN, PRESBYSTERY
     OF TURREFF.)

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM MOIR.

     Extent, River, &c.

   THE parish of Fyvie, though of considerable extent,
affords not much matter for Statistical Information;
concerning the etymology of the name, I never heard even
a conjecture hazarded.  It is about 13 miles in length, and
8 in breadth; supposed to contain about 20 or 22,000 acres,
8000 of which may be under culture, 1200 in plantations
and natural woods; the remainder, mosses, heath, and
rough pasture grass.  The small river Ithan, which takes
its rise about 5 or 6 miles above this, after passing through
the parish of Auchterless, and a part of Turriff, divides
this parish nearly into two equal parts, and falls into the
sea at the Newburgh, a small village in the parish of Fove-
ran.  On this river, there are two salmon fishings, one at
the mouth of it, and the other at Ellon, where there are
cruives, which prevent the salmon from getting this length,
except in great floods, and at spawning time.  But what
this small river is remarkable for, is, the pearls that are
sometimes found in it.  In the years 1762 and 1763, there
was a considerable number found in it, many of which sold
from 1 s. to 6 s. 8 s. and 10 s. the pearl, and there were two
of them so large as to sell, the one at L. 2, and the other
at L. 3 Sterling.
