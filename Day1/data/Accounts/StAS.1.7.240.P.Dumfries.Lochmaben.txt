     Statistical Account

January 1727.  The district is called Four Towns, as com-
prehending four populous villages.  Their possessions are ge-
nerally small.  The land on the river side is rich and fertile,
peculiarly favourable for the growth of flax, of which they
raise a good quantity.  Many of the men are weavers.  The
women spin their own flax, and a good deal of foreign flax
also.  Their possessions and valuations are distinguished by
acres.  There is a peculiarity in their land measure, and the
ell by which their acres have been measured (called the Ba-
rony ell), contains 42 inches, whereas the common ell made
use of in the country, is only 38 inches.

   Four Towns Commonty.-There was a large and extensive

acres.  On many of their shares are built small farm houses,
which has considerably increased the number of inhabitants
of the parish.

   Sirnames in the Four Towns.-The prevailing sirnames of
this district are, Richardson, Rae, Kennedy, Nicholson,
Wright, etc. of which the Richardsons are by far the most
numerous.  They add bye-names or nicknames to distinguish
one family from another of the same name.  If possessing
the same lands, from father to son, for many generations de-
nominates an old family, and gives the appellation of gentle-
man, here are numbers who have a just claim to that title,
having possessed the same ridges and acres for 500 years.
Some of these names are to be found among the companions
of Wallace and Bruce, in his wars for the recovery of his
antient inheritance of the kingdom of Scotland.  They are
