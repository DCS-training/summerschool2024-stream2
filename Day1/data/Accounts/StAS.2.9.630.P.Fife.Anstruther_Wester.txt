the schoolmaster, have likewise been lately erected. The landward
part of the parish has in like manner partaken of the general im-
provement. Notwithstanding the late depression in all kinds of pro-
duce. agriculture is carried on with spirit, and not without profit to-
the farmer. At the date of the last account, the rent of laud vari-
ed from L. 1, 1s. to L. 1, 1Os. per acre now it is from L. 2 to L. 3,
10s. Great attention is paid to the breeding and feeding of cattle:
and this is sometimes found to be one of the most profitable modes in
which the farmer can employ his capital. Draining, too, is carried on
to a considerable extent; and although the parish is small and not
naturally very fertile, the produce ofthe land bears a full proportion
to the surrounding district. In some respects, too, the morals
have undergone a change for the better. Hard drinking, which
was formerly so common, is never beard of in any family, having
the least pretensions to gentility, and it is to be hoped that the
example of their superiors will not be without effect on the lower
orders, among whom it is still too generally practised.
   The writer cannot conclude without adverting to the circum-
stance which has imposed on him the task of drawing up the fore-
going account,-the death of his much esteemed and lamented
friend, Dr Carstairs, late minister of the parish. In him, his family,
in church, and society at large, have lost a very valuable mem-
ber. All the duties, whether of his public or his private sta-
tion, he discharged with exemplary fidelity and zeal ; and it has
seldom been our lot to see any one more deeply or sincerely re-
gretted. He will long live in the memory of all that shared in his
friendship, or with whom he was in any way connected.
