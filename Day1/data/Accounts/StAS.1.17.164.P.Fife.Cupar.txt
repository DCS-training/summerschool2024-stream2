History of Edinburgh, "were without one.  That of
"Edinburgh was at the Greenside-well; that of Cupar in
"Fife was on their Castle-bill."

   Agriculture.-Fife, though possessing natural advantages
superior to those enjoyed by many neighbouring counties,
was, till of late, far behind them in the important knew-
ledge, and valuable improvements of agriculture.-The her-
ring fishery, the making of salt, the burning of lime, and
working of coal mines, circumstances which might naturally
have been expected to accelerate a meliorated husbandry,
contributed long to retard its progress.  Occupied entirely
in the pursuit of these objects, the great landholders in Fife
were unhappily diverted from paying that attention to the
surface of the ground, which would not have failed to have
made a more certain and valuable return for the expence
which they often incurred, and the activity and industry
they exerted.  During the last 15 years, however in many
districts of the county, the landholders and farmers have
adopted and prosecuted every plan of modern improvement,
with a degree of eagerness, perseverance, and success, not
surpassed in any corner of the island.  That part of toe coun-
ty, in particular, which lies between the Eden and the lay,
naturally fertile, has been subjected to a new and better made
of cultivation.  The farmers in this district, with a liberali-
ty which does them honour, readily acknowledge, that they
are indebted for many essential improvements, which are
now general among them, to the example of those who have
come to settle in Fife, from the opposite country of the Carse
of Gowrie.
