     of Boharm.

lightfully situated on a rising ground, above a pretty exten-
sive plain, half encircled by the Spey, in the south-western
end of the parish, near to which, a little farther down the
river, lie the haughs of Kailymore, a part of the same estate,
signifying the great wood; which epithet, in some degree, it
still comparatively merits.  The soil here is sandy, warm,
and fertile; but, in general, over the rest of the parish, it is
a stiff, rich, deep clay, generally on a bed of lime-stone, and
very retentive of water, with which it is too frequently sup-
plied, the summit of the mountain attracting or intercepting
the clouds borne along from the ocean by the north and
north-westerly winds, on which account the harvests are
rather late; and, though the air be moist, yet there is no
distemper generally prevalent.  The people are vigorous and
healthy; and severals attain to the longest term of human
life, there being at present several men, each 80, and one
woman accounted 100 years of age.
   The water of Fiddich, turned almost at right angles, from
an eastern to a northern course, along the west end of the
parish, steals in to the river Spey, which is only navigable
for floating timber down from Strath Spey, part of which is
manufactured into plank, deal, spar, and scantling, by two
saw-mills at the Boat of Brigg.  It is hardly necessary to no-
tice here the excellent salmon caught in the Spey, as the
public are already sufficiently apprised of this particular.
   The charter of Moray has preserved the memorial of the
bridge over Spey at this place.  Part of the foundation of
the southern pier still remains.  It has been supposed the
bridge was of timber.  Here also stood the Chapel of St Ni-
cholas-" Ad receptionem Pauperum transeuntium."  Both the
bridge and hospital were extant in the year 1232; but few
particulars of their history or destruction remain.
