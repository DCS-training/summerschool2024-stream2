   Proprietors.--In this parish there must be nearly 2OO heritors. Con-
sequently, property is very much subdivided and broken down. His
Grace the Duke of Hamilton is patron of the parish. He is superior
of nearly the whole, and proprietor of more than one-fourth of the
lands. In Hamilton of Wishaw's account of the Sheriffdom of
Lanark, it is stated, that "this baronie of Avendale did anciently
belong to the Bairds, and thereafter came to Sinclair, and from
them to the Earle of Douglass, with whom it continued several
ages; and after his fatall forfaultture in anno 1455, it was given by
King James the 3d to Andrew Stewart, whom he created Lord
Avendale, and it continued with him and his heirs tntil 1538 or
thereby, that he exchanged it with Sir James Hamilton for the
baronie of Ochiltree, in the Parliament 1543, from which time it
continued with the successors of Sir James Hamilton until it was
acquired by James first of that name, Marquis of Hamilton, and
continued with his successors since." There are twelve commis-
sioners of supply in the parish. The prinicipal properties are Nether-
field, belonging to Miss Young, Overton, Lambhill, Newton, &c.

  Remarkable Occurrences.--The people in this parish suffered
much from the "Bloody Claverhouse," who frequently visited this
district during the "persecuting times." He never forgot the
defeat which he experienced at Drumclog in this parish, on Sab-
bath the Ist June 1679. On that day the country people had
met for worship in great numbers, many of them armed, and de-
termined, if attacked, to defend themselves. Claverhouse rested
his men some time in the town of Strathaven, and then marched
west about six miles, when he came in sight of the Covenanters at
Drumclog, a farm belonging to the Duke of Hamilton, about two
