and exclusive privilege of fishing in the Castle and Mill
Lochs with boats, nets, etc.  The great estate of Murray
Earl of Annandale, of which the Castle and Barony of Loch-
maben is a part, fell, by succession, to Murray Lord Viscount
Stormonth, who also claims the title of Hereditary Keeper,
and Constable of the Castle of Lochmaben.

   Lairdner-mart Cow.-The governor or constable of the
Castle, had also, for the maintenance of the garrison, what
was called Laird a Mairt, or Lairdner Mart Cow, which was
one of the best fat cows out of every parish in Annandale.
It is not above 60 years since it was listed by the Marquis of
Annandale.  The conversion of it was 20 L. Scots, and was
listed out of 33 parishes, (which number is now reduced, by
annexations, at the Reformation, to 21); and 39 meadow
geese and Fasten's-e'en* hens.  All the parishes, at that time,
joined in procuring a suspension, which was never recalled,
or any payment demanded since.  The Castle has long been
in total ruin, and there is nothing now standing but a small
part of, the heart of the wall.  The fine ashlar work is all
stript off, and there are few houses in the neighbourhood, in
which some of the stones are not to be seen.  This is much
to be regretted; for had it been left to the devouring teeth of
time alone, it would have been to this day the noblest ruin
in Scotland.  It is surrounded by a large tract of land, cal-
led the Castlemains, in a very uncultivated state, in which are
two large lochs.  In former times there was a deer park, and
a very extensive oak forest.  These castles, and this part
of the country in general, were the scenes of some of the
heroic actions of the renowned Sir William Wallace of El-
lerslie.
