narch, King Edward I, * The walls of this chapel were de-
molished in 1715, and the materials employed  in the tem-
porary works then raised for defence against the rebels.
   A field near the Castle-dykers, formerly mentioned, still re-
tains the name of Kingholm, which may either have been
imposed upon it by Bruce, after the slaughter of Cornyn, or
may have been gradually formed by corruption from Co-
myn's holm, a name which it once bore.  At the opposite
end of the town, and upon the bank of the river, is another
field still called Nunholm, as lying adjacent to the nunnery
which was once established at Lincluden.
   Towards the lower end of this parish, and corresponding,
as is thought, to another similar one, near the castle of Caerla-
verock, and within that parish, is an eminence, called Tro-
haughton, which has been noticed by Pennant, as a Roman
station.  Hard by this town, is a third eminence, seeming-
ly of the same nature, called the Kirkland Moat.  These,
in the time of the border feuds, may have been stations for
the communication of intelligence.
   An antique, supposed to be a Roman sandal, which was
found towards the east end of this parish, is now in the pos-
session of Mr Riddel of Glenriddel.  In the same gentleman's
collection is also a small gold coin, scarcely so broad as a six-
pence, but nearly as thick as a half-crown, and bearing the
inscription AUGUSTUS, roand the impression of a Roman
bread.  It was found, 3 or 4 years ago in the Nith, nearly op-
posite to the town mills.  In digging for the foundation of a
house, several years since, near the Duke's monument, there
was an easther pot found, which contained a leathern bag
much decayed, and within it several old silver coins, with
four or five broaches or fibule, linked together.  Two of
these have appeared, upon comparison with the plates in
