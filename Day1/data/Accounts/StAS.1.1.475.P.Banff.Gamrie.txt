fishing towns on the coast, the breaking of large farms into
smaller ones, the encouragement given by the heritors to im-
prove waste ground, and their endeavouring to introduce a
better mode of culture.  The principal town in the parish is 
Macduff, the property of Lord Fife.  In 1732 there were only
a few fishermen's houses in Macduff, but now there are se-
veral well laid out streets, and 1000 souls in the town.  The
harbour, on which his Lordship has already laid out up-

   On the east end of this parish, there are very near to
one another two other small towns, Gardenston and Cro-
vie, both the property of Lord Gardenston, and not far from
his house at Troup.  The town of Gardenston contains
nearly 300 souls, and Crovie 100.  In these two places are
the same number of vessels and fishing-boats as in Macduff,
only the vessels are of a smaller size.  Lords Fife and Gar-
denston are the only heritors.  Lord Fife does not reside in
the parish, but one of his principal seats (Duff-house) is very
near it, being only about an English mile from Macduff.  His
Lordship has paid the greatest attention to the improvement
of his estates, and the good of the country, by encouraging,
