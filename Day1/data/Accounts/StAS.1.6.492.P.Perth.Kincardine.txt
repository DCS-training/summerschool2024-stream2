   Improvements.-The mosses of Kincardine and Flanders,
which cover more than 2000 acres of the Carse ground in this
parish, are in a situation similar to that of the mosses of Frosk and
Dunmore, betwix the Forth and Carron.  They are also evi-

mouth of the river, 7 miles measuring in a straight line, and 16 by the win-
dings of its channel.-Vessels drawing nine feet water may in the driest
seasons navigate the river, in neap tides, as far as Manour, or half the distance
to Craigforth.  Betwix those two places there are some shallows, over which
vessels, drawing more than five feet water, cannot pass at neap tides, when
the water was low.-At the bottom of the stream, below the bridge of
Gartmore, the surface of the river, when in its lowest state, is nearly 30 feet
higher than that below Craigforth in neap tides.-The difference is in ge-
neral much less, and especially where there is any fresh in the river.  The
common depth of the rivers is from 8 to 10 feet, but there are shallows in seve-
ral parts of it, upon some of which there are at times only two feet of water.-
From the termination of the tide-way at Craigforth, to the bottom of the
stream below the bridge of Gartmore, there are only three falls perceptible in
the river:  One of 8 feet at Craigforth; another of 3 feet, at the ford of
Frew; the third of 8 1/2 feet, at the bridge of Cardross.-It was proposed to
erect two locks, at Kildean below Craigforth, each six feet in height; to
make a canal, across a peninsula, from thart place to the southwest point
of Craigforth hill, and to raise a dam there, four feet in height, across
the channel of the river which supposed would raise the surface of it
nearly that height, as far as the ford of Frew.-A dam five feet high erec-
ted below the mouth of the Goody, which is below the Frew, it was supposed,
would make that river navigable 4 miles above Thornhill, and give dead water
in the Forth, near to the head of the ford at Cardross.-Another dam and
lock of the same height at the ford, it was supposed would give a sufficient
depth of water near to the bridge at Gartmore, and, when there was any
fresh in the river, would allow vessels to pass into the dead water above the
bridge.
   The expence of making this navigation in the Forth, from Kildean to
the bridge of Gartmore, and in the Goody, 4 miles above Thornhill, was esti-
mated at L. 5830 exclusive of the price of nine and a half acres of ground re-
quired for the canal at Kildean, and the temporary damage that would be
sustained by as much more ground.
   As the principal obstructions to the execution of this plan are greatly di-
minished or no longer exist, it is to be hoped that it will be resumed.
