Infield was constantly observed.  The former was cropped al-
ternately with oats and bear; the latter, after a few successive
crops of oats, was suffered to lie out a number of years in sea.
The run-rigg prevailed, too, in many places.  These absurd
practices are now worn out, and the modern improvements
generally introduced.  Ploughs drawn by cattle were former-
ly in use.  These are now succeeded by ploughs with two
horses abreast, where one man both holds and drives.

   Produce and Cattle.-Lint-feed is sown in considerable quan-
tities; and, when the seasons prove favourable it succeeds
very well; the lippie of seed frequently giving a stone of dres-
sed flax.  Half a century ago no wheat was raised in Coupar.
The quantity is still inconsiderable, owing to the difficulty of
procuring manure.  No field beans are raised.  Oats, barley,
and pease, are the grain in most request.  The barley is either
sold to the brewers in the town of Coupar, or carried to the
neighbouring ports, where it is either malted or put on ship-
board.  The other grain, made into meal, generally finds a
ready market in the populous village of Coupar.  The prices
of the corn are the same as an the neighbouring parishes.  The
grasses sown are rye-grass and red clover.  No hay is made but
for home consumption.  A few acres are generally fallowed in
summer, and fields of turnips reared for the cattle against win-
ter.  Each tenant brings up young cattle in proportion to the
extent of his farm.  These he disposes of to drovers, or such
as keep grass parks, who feed them, and take them to Fal-
kirk to meet the English merchants.  There are no sheep
kept in this district.  Potatoes are raised in large quantities,
and are of great service to the poor.  It is not much above 20
years, since this useful root came into general use in this parish.

   Leases.-The farms are commonly let for a term of 19 years,
