   tinues so to the distance of several miles beyond the parish.
The situation is at once pleasant, and advantageous for agri-
culture. The higher ground commands an extensive view of
the country around, and of the German Ocean and the
floping ground answers well for draining, which in many
places is much wanted; for the land abounds with boggs and
springs, or what husbandmen call spouts.  The greatest part
of the parish stands on rock of moor-stone, commonly called
sturdy:  It is of a dark blue colour, and of so close a texture
that water cannot penetrate it; and the surface of the ground,
especially during the winter months, is consequently very
loose and wet.  This rock is the only stone found in the pa-
rish fit for building.  It is quarried by blasting with gun-
powder, by which it is broke into such irregular pieces, that,
unless the masons be at uncommon pains, walls built of it are
not water tight.

   Soil, Produce, Rent, etc.-The soil of the higher part of
the parish is frequently shallow; but of the lower, deep and
rich, except a little on the sea-shore, which is sandy.  The 
land is on the whole fertile, and produces grain of the best
quality.  The rent of the arable land is at present from 9s.
to 15 s.  Sterling an acre, but will probably be raised at the
expiration of the present leases, some of which are not long.
No value is put on waste or pasture ground.  The valued
rent of the parish is L. 1550 Scots; the real rent about
L. 525 Sterling.

   There are eight farms in the parish, very different in size
and rent; and this number has been the same beyond the
memory of man.  Six of these farms, called the Barony of
Lunan, measuring 790 acres, including 196 acres of moor,
common to them all, belong to the Earl of Northest.  Ar-
