     Statistical Account

   "Mr John Livingston was likewise a native of this parish.
"He was born in the year 1603.  His father was a relation
"of the family of Kilsyth, and possessed a small estate in
"the east barony.  It would appear, that the name of this
"estate was Monaeburgh.  The greatest part of the village
"is built upon it, though the boundaries of it are not well
"known."
   "Mr Livingston was a man of letters and piety.  Early
"in life, he devoted himself to the study of divinity.  He
"held a charge in the ministry first in Ireland.  After
"spending a number of years in this charge, he was trans-
"lated to Stranraer, and next to Ancrum near Jedburgh.
"He was intelligent active, zealous, and successful in
"promoting the interests of pure and undefiled religion.
"His memory is still dear; and though the memoirs he
"wrote are in few hands, they are eagerly read by the inha-
"tants of Kilsyth."
   "His life, transactions, and death, are narrated at some
"length.  He died in the year 1672."
   "I have had occasion to mention, that Mr Robert
"Graham of Tamrawer, was a native of this parish; and
"that his name deserves to be handed down to posterity,
"on account of his very successful experiments upon the cul-
"tivation of potatoes."
   "It may perhaps deserve to be mentioned, that there
"is a family of the name of Stevenson, who for many
"generations have been eminently useful, and much em-
"ployed in restoring dislocated joints, and dressing bro-
"ken limbs.  Though in a great measure ignorant of
"the theory, they have at least acquired the practice; and
"in all generations, as well as this, have been often suc-
"cessful."
