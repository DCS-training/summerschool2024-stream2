     Statistical Account

that since he became proprietor of Innes, all the highways
within the parish have been properly attended to, judiciously
directed, and, by a regular application of the statute labour,
kept in a state of good repair+, The only other heritor is
Mr INNES of Leuchars++, who has about one fifth of the
real rent of the parish.  He is at uncommon pains to raise
and fence hedges; he has planted stripes and belts about the
ground round his house to a very considerable extent, besides
several clumps similar to those executed by Lord FIFE.  There
clumps, like his Lordship's, at present consist chiefly of Scotch
firs; but the plantations around his farm, and about his house,
are all deciduous trees of the belt kinds; oak, ash, and witch
elm, with a proper mixture of larix, which are all uncom-
monly well preserved, besides being kept under the hoe for
several years after they are planted.  The water of Lossy runs
through the property of this gentleman; that river swells
sometimes to a great height, and frequently flooded the low
ground on each side; but of late, with great industry and
merit, embankments have been constructed, that will contain
the river, and in a great measure prevent future inundations:
By this circumstance the value of his lands is considerably
raised.

<FOOTNOTE>

+The house of Inner, one of Lord Fife's numerous seats, had been many
years ago partly destroyed by accidental fire.  Since his Lordship became its
possessor, it has been repaired at a very considerable expence, and fitted up
in the most fashionable stile; a large addition has been made to the gardens,
and the grounds about the house have been laid out in the best taste; the
whole makes now one of the most pleasant and elegant places of residence in
the North.

++ Before Mr INNES succeeded to this estate, it had been in the possession
of a gentleman who paid very little attention to improvements of any kind.
Since the present gentleman became proprietor, it has undergone a very
great alteration to the better.
