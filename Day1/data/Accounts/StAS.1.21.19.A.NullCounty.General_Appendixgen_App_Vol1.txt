almost one plain haugh between hills, from its rise, through
part of the south-east side of Oxnam, through the middle
of Hounam and of Morbattle parishes, till it enters the parish
of Eckford, a little above Marlefield house: then it is more
confined between tiring banks, and runs more rapidly, till
it falls into the Teviot, a little below Eckford kirk.  The Kale

reading and writing, 2 s.; and when arithmetic is taught, the
school wages are 2 s. 6 d. per quarter.  The emoluments of
the schoolmaster as session clerk is about L. 1:5-as clerk to
the heritors, L. 3 per annum.  His house and school are
kept in repair at the expence of the heritors.

very favourable to morals and true piety.  These people were
