space, about 350 feet long and 160 feet broad, divided into
a good many apartments, which had been strongly built of
coarse red quarry stone and lime, with a fosse on one side,
and the appearance of bastions towards another.  From its
peculiar situation, and apparent strength of the works, it may
have been easily defended before the invention of artillery.
There are several traces of old encampments on different
moors in the parish.  A trench or row of large human bones
was lately discovered, a good way beyond the boundary of
the present burying ground.  And there are several long
stones in the church-yard, of a hard close texture, with an-
tique figures of spears, arrows, and stars, carved upon them
in also relieves.  All there may be vestiges of the conflicts of
the Northern Clans, or of defences against the Danes, and
other foreign invaders from this Frith.  But no authentic his-
tory or tradition, worth mentioning, is now extant concern-
ing them.
