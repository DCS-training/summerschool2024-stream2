make our horizon to the S. About 20 or 30 years ago,
there was no such thing to be seen as trees or hedges in
this parish; all was naked and open; every farm-house, old,
paltry, inconvenient, and unpleasantly situated; not a
single made road, either to kirk or market.  Now, all is
completely inclosed, and subdivided by ditches and thorn
hedges.  New houses, on a regular convenient plan, and

levied from the tenants, according to the proportion of
valued rent which they hold, and from each householder,
in terms of the statute; or money is borrowed from indi-
viduals, who have it to spare, upon the security of one or
more trustees, whose interest is most promoted by the roads
in this or the other direction, and the toll-duties, with the
other assessments already mentioned, are applied to the
payment of the interest, and the gradual extinction of the
