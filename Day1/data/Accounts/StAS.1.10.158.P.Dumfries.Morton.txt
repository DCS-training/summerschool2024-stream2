   Climate and Diseases.-A surgeon resides in this parish,
whose medical practice extends over a large district of coun-
try around.  The soil here being mostly dry, the air is pure
and wholesome.  Agues are hardly known at all; nor in-
deed are there any diseases to which the people are particu-
larly subject.  Inoculation for the small-pox has, for a consi-
derable number of years, been practiced with the greatest
success.  It is now pretty general, and is continually becoming
more so, the prejudices of the people against it giving way to
the force of their happy experience.

   Ecclesiastical State, Schools, and Poor.-The church was
built about 12 years ago, and will contain 500 or 600 people.
The manse and offices are of longer standing, and need con-
siderable repairs.  The stipend consists of 58 L. 6 s. 8 d. and
one chalder of victual, with 3 L. 6 s. 8 d. for communion ele-
ments.  A considerable augmentation will, it is hoped, soon
be obtained.  The glebe is of the extent required by law.
The Duke of Queensberry is patron.  The schoolmaster's
salary is only 100 merks Scotch, which, with a house, a
cow's grass, 3 roods of croft land, and very small wages from
the scholars, is his whole provision.  The present school-
master is a very old man; and, when a vacancy shall happen,
it is hardly to be supposed that any person properly qualified
will, for such trifling emoluments, be induced to become his
successor.  There is no body of men more useful than the
parochial schoolmasters, and there is none whose allowance
is generally more inadequate to their situation.  The poor
are supported by the collections made weekly at the church,
