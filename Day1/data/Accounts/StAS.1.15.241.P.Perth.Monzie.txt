     NUMBER XIV.

     PARISH OF MONZIE,

     (COUNTY OF PERTH, PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER SYNOD
     OF PERTH AND STIRLING.)

     By the Rev. Mr GEORGE ERSKINE, Minister.

     Origin of the Name.

   ALL competent judges of the Gaelic agree that the
name Monzie is derived from that language.  But they differ
a little about its orthography or signification.  Some think
it should be wrote Monieu, which signifies Deer Hill, as pro-
bably at that period the hills abound with that species of
game.  Others think it should be wrote Moniui, which sig-
nifies hill foot, and is very expressive of the situation of the
habitable parts of the parish.  But a third class maintain, and
with the greatest probability, that it should be wrote Moeghe,
which signifies good plain, as the low lying-grounds are pret-
ty fertile.

   Extent, Form, and Situation.-The extent of this parish is
very considerable, being from E. to W. 7 English miles, and
