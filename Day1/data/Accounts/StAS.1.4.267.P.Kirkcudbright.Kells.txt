and moors on the south end of this parish, about 60 years
ago, and were claimed as the property of Lord Kenmore;
at present they are all destroyed.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The peculiar advantages
of this parish are these:  The particular richness of the taste
and flavour of the mutton sed on our high hills, above that
sed on the lower and richer grounds; a town, with a con-
stant weekly market; a post-office; the high road from
Edinburgh to Portpatrick, and from Glasgow to Kirkcud-
bright passing through it, and crossing one another at New
Galloway.-The peculiar disadvantages of it are, the high
situation of the ground, rendering the high hills cold and
stormy, and dangerous to sheep; the bad roads through the
interior parts of it; the pernicious quality of a species of
grass to the health of the sheep in 2 or 3 farms on the side
of the Dee, infecting them with a disease called the Van-
quish, i.e. it weakens, wastes, and would at last kill them,
unless removed to another farm; but are no sooner removed
than they recover their health, and gradually their strength
and fatness.  This disease is of a different nature from the rot;
for rotten sheep put upon these farms (I am told) often re-
cover.-The best means of meliorating the condition of the
people of this parish, would be, 1st, Encouraging and pro-
moting a woollen manufactory at New Galloway; 2dly, Im-
proving the breed of sheep, and quality of the wool.  This
last has already been attempted, and in some measure ef-
fected, by the premium given by the Society for the En-
couragement of Fishing and Manufactures, and, if conti-
nued, will still more promote this good purpose.  3dly, Ma-
king a canal from the sea by the Carlingwork Loch, to
join Loch Dee, a scheme some years ago projected, the
ground surveyed and levelled, and the expence estimated,
but of late dropped.  This would be a great advantage to
