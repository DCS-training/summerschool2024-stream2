have been places of strength.  Thus the castle of Arnfindlay,
of which no vestiges now remain; the tower of Garden, part
of which, was standing 20 or 30 years ago; the remains of
the house and castle of Arnprior, may still be traced.  The
house of Broich too, seems to have been surrounded with a
rampart and fosse.  A small green mound on the eastern con-
fines of the lands of Buchlyvie, appears to have been a tumu-
lus.  Some human bones, inclosed in slags of stone, were
lately found in it; but there is no tradition which gives any
account of its origin.-Some years ago, an urn containing
ashes and bones, was found in the Castle-hill of Dasher.
There are several small heights in this parish, to which the
name Keir* is applied, which bear the marks of some ancient
military work, viz.  Keir-hill of Glentirran, Keir-hill of Da-
sher, Keir brae of Drum, Keir know of Arn-more, and
Keir-brae of Garden.  On the summit of each of these, there
is a plain of an oval figure, surrounded with a rampart,
which in most of them still remains entire.  The Peel of Gar-
den, (on which there is a work of the same kind,) is less ele-
vated in point of situation; it rises but a little above the
carse.  The inclosure however is considerably larger than that
of the Keirs; and the rampart and ditch, in respect of form
and appearance, have suffered less from the injuries of time.
None of these are of sufficient extent to have ever admitted
of a regular encampment.  The circumference of the rampart
on the Keir-hill of Dasher, (which is neither the largest nor
tim smallest, and the only one that has been measured,) does
not exceed 130 yards.  Various opinions have been entertain-
ed concerning these works.  The country people say that
they were Pictish sorts.  A different conjecture suposes
