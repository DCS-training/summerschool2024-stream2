     Statistical Account

Charles II.'s time, was born in the castle of Lochslin; but
there is no certainty of it.  Farquhar, the first Earl of Ross,
and founder of the abbacy, was buried in this parish, as
were several others of the Earls of Ross.  There is an area
in the abbacy, appropriated for a burial place for all
of the name of Ross; almost all of whom in the north,
bury there.  General Charles Ross of Balnagown, who
was advanced to the highest military honours, and who
had a principal had in 2 very bloody wars against the
King of France, for the liberty of Europe, under the au-
spices of William and Anne, was buried here.  This man
was equally famous for the arts of peace and war.  He
died at Bath, in the 66th year of his age, 1732.  There is also
buried here, the valiant and brave Admiral Sir John Ross
of Balnagown.

     Miscellaneous Observations.-The people are sober, regu-
lar, decent, and industrious; they are also generous and hu-
mane.  Their condition, however, might be ameliorated
considerably, could they have coals imported duty free,
and some heavy multures removed, which hinders the im-
provement of land, and checks any attempts for the esta-
blishing of manufactures.  None are obliged to leave
the parish for want of employment.  Some few inlist year-
ly as soldiers.  Many inlisted in the late General Fraser's
regiment, and many also in the 73 d. and some in the 42 d
and 75th regiments.  The people are generally healthy
and robust, and rather above the common stature.  There
may be 12 in the parish above 6 feet high.-The common
people speak the Gaelic language, though many of them
now understand the English.  The names of places seem
to be wholly derived from the Gaelic, and are expres-
sive of their situation, occupation of the inhabitants, qua-
lity of the place or soil, etc.-The lands in this parish
