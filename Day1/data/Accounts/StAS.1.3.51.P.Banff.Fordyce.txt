     of Fordice.

this parish were born in England.-Great numbers are born
to the west of Spey.  A great part of the servants male and
female come from other parishes, in quest of more liberty,
and better wages; particularly from the more northerly parts
of the island.-No nobility have resided in this parish since
the end of last century, when the family of Findlater told
Durn.  Resident families are Birkenbog, Glassaugh, and
Durn; only Sir George Abercrombie of Birkenbog, has pul-
led down the old family seat, and has not yet rebuilt it.-
There are six heritors.-There is a minister of the establish-
ed church at Fordice, and a preacher of Portsoy, presented
by the present Lord Findlater's grandfather with L. 20 year-
ly; likewise a Relief one, occationally a Nonjuror Episcopa-
lian minister, and a Popish priest.-There is one notary, and
one messenger.-One surgeon at Portsoy, and one apothe-
cary.-The great body of the people are Presbyterians of the
establised church.-There are a few Seceders.-A consider-
able number of Episcopalians.-A few Papists.

   The population of the parish is not very materially diffe-
rent from what it was 25 years ago.  The decrease of sub-
tenants by throwing many small tacks into one, is balanced
by tenanting the grass-rooms, and the increase of people at
Portsoy.  The tenants alongst the coast paid large victual
rents; and therefore, found it convenient to have grass farms
in the upper part of the parish, for subsisting their cattle in
summer.  In these farms the solding grounds were only
sown.  The introduction of grass-seeds, and partial conver-
tion of victual rent, have rendered this policy unnecessary;
and it is discontinued.

   None have died for want since the 1700.-None have left
the parish for want of employment, except a few day-labourers,
