the King, that he conferred the honour of Knighthood on
his host that very day.  Amongst the King's attendants, was
a trooper much celebrated for his ability in drinking intoxi-
cating liquors.  Among the laird of Tulliebole's vassals, there
was one named Keltie, (a name still common in the barony,)
equally renowned for the same kind of dangerous pre-emin-
ence.  The trooper and he had heard of each other; and
each was desirous to try the strength of the other.  They had
no opportunity while the King was there; but they agreed to
meet early on a Monday morning, soon after, on the same
spot where the King had dined.  It is not said what kind of
liquor they made use of; but they drank it from what are
here called quaffs, a small wooden vessel, which holds about
half an English pint.  They continued to drink, till the
Wednesday evening, when the trooper fell from his seat,
seemingly asleep.  Keltie, took another quaff, after the
fall of his friend, to show that he was the conqueror; and
this gave rise to a proverb, well known over all this country,
Keltie's Mends; and nothing is more common, at this very
day, when one refuses to take his glass, than to be threatened
with, Keltie's Mends.  Keltie dropped from his seat after-
wards, and fell asleep.  But when he awakened, he found
his companion dead.  He was buried in the same place, and
as it is near a small pool of water, it still retains the name of
"the Trooper's Dubb."  The anecdote should serve as a warning
against the criminal and preposterous folly which occasioned
it.  Some of the people are still credulous enough to imagine,
that the trooper is still seen sometimes sitting on the spot;
and in the night, would rather go a mile out of their way,
than pass by the Trooper's Dubb.  The road leading by this
place, still retains the name of the Court Gate, or Court Way.
   Among the antiquities of the parishes, may also be enu-
