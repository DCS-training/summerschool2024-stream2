     of Inverbervie or Bervie

tillery was erected in the neighbourhood of the town of
Bervie, on a small scale.  On the beach of Bervie, there
is a salmom-fishing, which yields the proprietors, Viscount
Arbuthnot and Mr Barclay of Ury, L. 120 Sterling year-
ly rent.  The salmon are of an excellent quality; and 
when plenty, are sold at a reasonable price, from 2 1/3 d.  to 
4 d. a-pound.  Bervie water abounds with trouts and eels,
which are caught by the rod in the proper season.  In the 
town of Bervie, there are nine shops, which retail to the 
town and country around, soft ware, grocery goods, etc.
There are five ale-houses, for retailing beer, spirits, etc.
besides a tavern, which is intended principally for the ac-
commodation of travellers, and the genteeler sort of com-
pany in the town and neighbourhood.  It is to be regret-
ted, that the comsumption of spirits is to considerable in 
this place; it must have a great effect to corrupt and de-
bauch the morals and manners of the people.  A weekly 
market was establihsed about 18 months ago, which is a 
great conveniency to the inhabitants of the town and
neighbourhood, as it affords a regular supply of butcher-
meat, meal, and every thing else which the country pro-
duces.  A weekly market was attempted about 30 years
ago, but did not succeed, as the demand and consumpt for 
provisions was not then so considerable as now.  The in-
creased consumption of provisions is not owing to any in-
crease of population, but to the extravagance of the labour-
ing people, and the high wages they receive- Two fairs
were held last year on the town's moor, and will be con-
tinued annually; the one in May, the others in September:
These fairs will be an advantages as well as a conveniency 
to the inhabitants of the coast-side; for it is in public mar-
kets that farmers transacts the principal part of their bufi-
