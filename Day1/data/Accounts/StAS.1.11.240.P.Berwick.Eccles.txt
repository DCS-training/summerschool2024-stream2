It was built after the model of the Chapel of Ease in Edin-
burgh, is in every respect well finished, and is, without dis-
pute, the best and handsomest country church in Berwickshire.
The present incumbent was the first minister who preached in
it.  The manse and offices were built at the same time.  They
were removed from the place where they formerly stood,
which was a little to the S. W. of the mansion-house of
Eccles; and as the heritors would not consent to the removal,
unless Sir John was at the whole expence of the new build-
ings, he acceded to the conditions.  The glebe was exchanged
at the same time, and placed very conveniently in the front
of the manse.  It consists of rather more than 20 acres of
good arable ground, and is well worth as many pounds Ster-
ling.  As the stipend, when the present minister entered to
the charge, did not exceed 72 L., every thing included, he was
obliged to pursue for an augmentation.  The Lords of Session
granted one to the extent of 30 L.: But, what is extremely
hard on him, although it is above 18 years since it was ob-
tained; the allocation is not yet finally settled.  Several of the
heritors, indeed, paid by the first allocation, but many more
have refused payment; and there are arrears, at this moment
due, to the extent of several hundred pounds.

   Poor.-The poor, that are rated in the books, amount to
the number of 30 persons; and the parish is assessed in 120 L.
per annum for their support.  As for the industrious poor,
when families may want occasional support, they are relieved,
either from the money collected on the Sabbath-day, or by
the generosity of the gentlemen in the parish.  The author
mentions it to their honour, that on a proper representation
of distress, he has always found them liberal and beneficent.
