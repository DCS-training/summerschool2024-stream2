tile.  A few farms on the S. W. side of the parish are light
and gravelly.  Of some the soil is a deep rich loam; but in
the middle, and on the N. E. side, it chiefly inclines to clay.
Part lies on a cold tilly bottom, and part on rock; but having
the advantage of a southern exposure, and being sheltered by
the rising grounds from the North, it produces luxuriant
crops, when properly cultivated.  In the interior parts lies a
considerable tract of moor, where the qualities of the soil
are various.  Some places are wet and spungy, others dry
and gravelly; but the greatest part is capable of being culti-
vated.

   Plantations.-The number of acres occupied in planting,
both of moor and pleasure grounds, does not exceed 50.  The
Scotch fir is not found to thrive here; but the larch and
other forest trees make considerable progress in dens, and
such places as are sheltered from the sea air.  Close upon
the coast, great trouble and expence is necessary to raise trees.
They require to be planted very thick, and after all seldom
come to any size.

   Agriculture* and Produce-None of the proprietors of this
parish, who cultivate their own grounds, strictly adhere to

*In so little repute was farming before the year 1712, that the proprie-
tor of Brotherston found it necessary to give premiums in order to induce
tenants to rent his farms.  To one he gave a present of 500 merks Scotch,
and farm stocking to the value of 2000 merks, free of interest for three years;
to another the same sum in a present, and 3000 merks value of stock for his
farm, free of interest for 4 years.  There is no necessity now for holding out
pecuniary temptations to the farmer.  Since the above mentioned period, the
rents are tripled, and numbers are still ready to offer a considerable advance,
when the lease of a farm expires.
