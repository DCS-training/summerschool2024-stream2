     NUMBER XXIV.

     PARISH OF RATHO.

     (County of Mid.  Lothian.-Presbytery of Edinburgh.-
     Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale.)

     By the Reverend Mr JAMES ROBERTSON.

     Situation, Extent, Surface, etc.

   BEFORE the Reformation, Ratho was a parsonage, un-
der the provostry of Corstorphine; and, as every pa-
rish, in times of Popery, had a tutelar saint, that of Ratho
had been dedicated to the Virgin Mary.  This appears, not
only from tradition, but from this farther circumstance, that
the consecrated well near the church, a copious stream of very
pure water, still bears the name of the Lady's Well.
   The parish is a little more than 4 miles long and about 3 1/2
broad.  A narrow irregular corner, which runs very far to
the south-west, and in which there are few inhabitants, if
taken into the computation, would extend the length of the
parish above a mite farther.  The east part of it is a fine flat
country, lying exactly in the middle between the Pentland
Hills and the Frith of Forth, and reaching within 5 miles of
the capital.  The western part contains several small hills,
all covered with green, but very rocky.  Those towards the
north are all whin-stone; but the hills of Dalmahoy and
Kaims, on the south side, abound much in free-stone.
