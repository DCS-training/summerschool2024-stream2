   Freestone, Fishing, etc.-Through a great part of the
parish, along the sea, and the rivulets running into it, quar-
ries of freestone abound, which supply the country around
in millstones, and from thence other hewn work is occa-
sionally sent by boats across the frith.  There is a salmon
fishing belonging to the Cromarty estate, on the water of 
Conan, from thence the fish are sent to Inverness, to be
shipped for London.  Except the few hands employed
about the fish, nets and coops, at that place, there are no
fishermen belonging to this parish; nor are any fish worth

rishes, on each side of the frith, and at high prices.

   Poor.-In this populous parish the poor are very nume-
rous.  The number of them on the kirk-session's list com-
monly exceeds 200.  The funds alotted for their relief,
being partly of a fluctuating nature, cannot ascertained
with precision.  They admit, however, one year with an-
other, after payment of salaries to the session-clerk, and
other parish officers, of a distribution among the poor, of a-
bout L. 23 or L. 24 Sterling annually.  The general and severe
scarcity, of the years 1783 and 1784, called for a more un-
