     Statistical Account

   Heritors.-There are 8 heritors, only one of whom, viz.
Mr Frazer of Gortuleg, occasionally resides in the parish.
The non-residence of heritors may, in the opinion of some,
be an advantage, as hereby that degree of luxury is prevent-
ed, which excites particular persons to aim at making a
higher figure than is consistent with their circumstances; but
perhaps it would be for the general good of the tenants, that
they were like a family, under the immediate eye and obser-
vation of their master, so that his care might extend, as much
as possible, to every individual residing upon his property.
Indeed while the rents and produce of almost all the estates
in a parish are spent out of it, no great improvement can be
expected to take place.

   Roads.-The roads of communications are properly attended
to by the gentlemen concerned, and annually repaired.  The
statute labour is converted into money.  The sheriff of the
county, who is an heritor, takes as active concern in every
thing that regards the police of the county in general, and of
this parish in particular.  He is ever labouring at the suppres-
sion of vices in general, especially such as are the most likely
to affect the welfare of the community.

   Church and School.-The stipend is 40 l. Sterling, and 3
chalders of victual, half bear, half meal.  It has not been
augmented since the year 1740.  The glebe contains exactly
4 acres.  The manse was built upwards of 50 years ago, and
has since undergone various reparations.-The parochial
school is far from being in a flourishing condition.  The
number of scholars has not, at any time, at least since the
admission of the present incumbent, in 1785, exceeded 20.
The salary is only 100 merks.
