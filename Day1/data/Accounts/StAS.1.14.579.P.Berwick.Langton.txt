     Of Langton.

   Agriculture, Cattle, Rent, &c.- Little was done for
the improvement of the land here before 1758.  Lang-
ton-burn, a strong and clear stream which runs through
the parish from N. W. to E., had its banks planted with
forest trees to a considerable extent, about 80 years ago.
The trees throve well, and have been long, and are still
a shelter and ornament to the house and enclosures of
Langton, as well as a beauty in the face of the country.
Several fields too had been enclosed with fences of dif-
ferent kinds a short time after the Restoration, and had
been for many years let from year to year for grass to
troop horses.  The soldiers, who were accommodated in
barracks on the estate, and in the town of Langton, spoke
of the pasture as the best their horses came to in the
kingdom, and were particularly pleased with the pure wa-
ter which is to be had in plenty in every grass field.  In
1758, Mr. Gavin purchased the estate lying in the pa-
rishes of Langton, Dunse, and Longsormacus.  From that
period till the time of his death in 1773, he was employ-
ed in the improvement of it.  The plans he laid down
were judicious, and the prosecution of them unremitted.
The grounds were cleared of surze, and broom, and stones,
and of every thing that could impede the operations of the
plough.  The rock marl, with which the estate abounds, and
lime from the Northumberland hills, at the distance of 16
miles, were laid on as the soil required; the fields were di-
vided with still, and enclosed in the most substantial man-
ner.  In a short time, Langton assumed a most: cultivated ap-
pearance, rewarded the attention, and repaid the expense
the proprietor had bestowed upon it.  The rent in 1758
was 1100 l.; in 1773 it was let at upwards of 3000 l.
There are in the parish 30 ploughs, all of them according
to Mr. Small's construction.  The number of horses is
