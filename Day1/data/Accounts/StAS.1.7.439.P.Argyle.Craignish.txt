some; and it yields a considerable quantity of oil, which is often
sold at 16 d. per Scotch pint.  Perhaps cod and ling might be
found; but no attempt has been made to discover the banks
which they haunt.  Indeed, while the country shall remain
in its present depressed condition, without trade and without
manufactures to collect its inhabitants, to increase consump-
tion, and circulate money, it is morally impossible that the
exertions of industry should, in this, or any other respect, aim
at more than bare subsistence.  The herring sometimes find
their way to the small creeks upon the coast; but the great
tide is so near, that they are soon swept away; and, as this
kind of fishing is precarious, the people are seldom proper-
ly prepared for it.  If, however, they continue for any time
upon the coast, a man with a few nets will more than supply
his own family.  The price depends on the quantity of salt
in the country at the time.  If this commodity, as often hap-
pens, is scarce, it is vain to fish more than they can eat, un-
til a supply shall come from Ireland; but if there is plenty of
salt, the herrings will sell at 1 s. and sometimes 1 s. 6 d. per
hundred.  When a supply from Ireland is mentioned, it is
proper to observe, that salt, under the present system of ma-
nagement, is an article with which the people in the High-
lands can never be properly supplied.  The want of stores ju-
diciously disposed through the country-the bonds and pro-
visos that stand in the way, render it impossible to make a
general provision for a herring fishing which, on many parts
of the coast, is transitory and precarious.  Thus smuggling is
encouraged, nay, made necessary; and thus the fishing in
general is discouraged-and thus many opportunities of con-
tributing less or more to the wealth and prosperity of the na-
tion, are for ever lost.
