servants are L. 6, and sometimes L. 7 Sterling per annum,
with their victuals.  The wages of female servants are about
L. 2: 10: 0.  The prices of provisions in this parish are re-
gulated by the neighbouring towns, Perth, Kinross, etc.

   Church and Stipend.-Part of the church, at least, must
have been built before the Reformation, as there is a place
in the wall for the font;  and the statue of the foundress (said
to have been a Mrs Barclay) has the beads used by Catholics
hanging around the hands.  The church was originally a cha-
pel, built for the accommodation of the family of Balvaird,
and their dependants.  The stipend is L. 513: 19: 3 Scots,
with 30 bolls and 1 sirlot of meal;  the glebe is scarcely worth
L. 6 Sterling; so that when the meal sells at 16 s. a boll, the
stipend, including the glebe, will amount to about L. 70 Ster-
ling.  The manse was repaired about 10 years ago.  The 
church has got few repairs for these last 100 years.  Messrs
David and Adam Low of East Fordel are joint patrons.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is one quarry of good
whin-stone in the parish, and more might be discovered if
the ground were dug to a sufficient depth.  After much rain,
the river comes down with great force.  It is said, that, in
the place where a barley mill now stands, a fulling  mill was
entirely swept away by a flood.  There are about 52 ploughs
in this parish; many of them are drawn by oxen; but the
number of such ploughs is gradually diminishing.  There is 
only 1 two-wheeled chaise.  A very small hill stands near
Damhead, between the new road to Kinross and the water of
Farg, which is called Gallow-Hill, where it is said stood a
gallows, upon which persons belonging to the barony of Bal-
vaird were executed during the feudal system.  On the south-
of East Fordel house there is a piece of ground named the
