half of the money required for the purchase of shares and the
erection of piers, on condition that the other half should be advan-

The original funds subscribed being exhausted, there was a se-
cond application, in 1812, made to Government, and a new sub-
scription. By these means the Long Craig Pier was built; * the
small East Battery Pier; the West Battery Pier on the north side
was raised and enlarged; the North Ferry Pier lengthened, &c.
   Steam navigation was introduced, and the Queen Margaret put
on the passage on October 1st 1821. This caused additional ex-
pense in the raising of the piers. To meet this, the sinking fund
was pledged, two large sailing boats were put down, and two pin-
naces with their crews. The Queen Margaret cost L. 2369.
Since September 1820, there have been three large sailing boats
of the original construction, the Earl of Moray half-tide boat, and
three pinnaces. The crews of these, thirty-six men and boys
The hire of a boat, when light, 2s. 6d.; dark, 5s. Large ditto,
light, 5s.; dark, 6s. Exemptions from the above rates, mail
horses or expresses from the post-office; soldiers on March, horses
of officers, ordnance carts, volunteers, if in uniform; carts carry-
ing vagrants with the legal passes. By the act, not more than two-
thirds of the boats, and yawls to remain at each side. The boat-
men are not liable to be impressed. Two superintendents to be
appointed.
   Steam navigation by the Frith and across it, by coaches passing
to Burntisland, greatly diminished the number of passengers at
this ferry, but in 1811, we have the following account: 228 per-
sons crossed each day, and sometimes 447; 1515 carriages annu-
