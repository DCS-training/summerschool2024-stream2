1. Brown and white fine threaded linens, deno-
     minated Silesias, chiefly printed for handker-
     chiefs; with Britannias, Kentings, etc. for
     export trade, may be estimated above,                L. 120,000.
   These articles Perth has been long famed for
     manufacturing.
2. Stout Holland sheetings of various breadths;
     with 7/8 and 4/4 Holland shirting, and a few
     long lawns, above,                                       12,000
3. Four-fourths wide brown and white country
     linen, chiefly used for hat-linings, buck-
     rams, etc. Brown Hollands, Hessians, pack-
     sheetings, and other coarse fabrics, manu-
     factured in the neighbourhood; including
     soldiers shirtings, with a few coarse sheet-
     ings, and Ofnaburgs purchased.                           20,000
4. Five-fourths wide umbrella linens, and linens
     for window blinds, etc. above                             8,000
5. The cotton manufacture was rapidly extend-
     ing; but met with a severe check last sum-
     mer, by a reduction of the value of goods
     manufactured, and has not yet recovered
     its former vigour.  The shock did not affect
     the linen manufactures in a similar degree.
   Shawl-cloths, calicoes and muslins, with a
     very few pulicate handkerchiefs, are pro-
     duced from cotton-yarn, which were esti-
     mated within bounds, at L. 80,00 sterling
     per annum; but owing to the late check in
     the market, shall only be extended to                   60,000
         Total amount of the linen and cotton-
         trade, which the committee are confident -
         is under-rated.                                 L. 220,000
