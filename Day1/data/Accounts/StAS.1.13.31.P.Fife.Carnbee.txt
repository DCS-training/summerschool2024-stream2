bill Frequently it happened, owing to a variety of dif-
ferent causes, that these bills turned out good for nothing.
The kirk-session therefore, about 10 years ago, judged it
expedient, that instead of lending out any small sums for
the future to parishioners in the above predicament, that
they would rather at once give them in charity, according
as the funds would admit, a part or perhaps the whole of
what they humbly proposed to borrow.  This plan has had
a very good effect, in so far as it has prevented some from
borrowing of the kirk-session, what it is too probable they
never would have been able to repay, and what was, per-
haps, too great a sum to have been allowed them out of the 
funds upon the head of charity.  Besides it has prevented
the minister and elders, from being under the disagreable
necessity of prosecuting any of their fellow parishioners, for
the recovery of small sums due the fund, at the same time
that they know now, with more certainty, what annual-
rents, etc. they have to deburse.  At present, besides the
Sunday collections, (which one day with another through

to the poor in the parish, that there are only two of the he-

Anstruther of Balcaskie.  The loss, however, is in a great
measure made up by the charity of those respectable fami-

residing heritors, and by the kind attention of some of the
non-residing heritors themselves, who in years of scarcity
have most seasonably contributed to their support.
