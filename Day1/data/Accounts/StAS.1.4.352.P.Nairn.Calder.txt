of oat-meal, in particular, to the neighbouring towns of In-
verness, Nairn, and Fort George.  It sells a good many
cattle and sheep to the butchers in those towns, and to
drovers.  It affords much barley to the distillers, of whom
there are 2 in the parish.  The rent of the parish is about
L. 1200 Sterling.  Some acres of arable land are let at 15 s.
an acre, and some so low as 2 s. 6 d.  The size of the farms
is very different, some consist of upwards of 100 acres, and
others below 40.  There are not as yet many inclosures,
but the tenants are sensible of the advantage of having their
land inclosed, and some of the more opulent have begun to
inclose and sence.  The situation of the parish in 1782 and
1783 was surely bad enough, though not so ill as in many
places.  The corns were not so much hurt by the frost, of
course, the crop was better, and few of the cattle died, ha-
ving been maintainded chiefly on the tops of whins, cut and
threshed, of which there are great quantities almost in eve-
ry part of the parish.  Oats are sown the latter end of
March, barley generally before the 20th of May; and they
are begun to be reaped between the 1st and 12th of Sep
tember.

7 d. a-day throughout the year, with some other advan-
tages; such as a house and garden, time to gather and pre-
pare his fuel, an extraordinary allowance in harvest, with
liberty to plant potatoes, as far as any dung he can gather
