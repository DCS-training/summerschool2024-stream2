this parish, and employed in coasting trade.  But a much
greater number of sailors, than are sufficient to man
them, are constantly at sea on board of other vessels.
The most of them are employed in herring fishing.

   Church, Stipend, etc.-The church is in tolerable re-
pair.  It was built about 60 years ago; but now too
small to contain the inhabitants, who wish to attend di-
vine service.  There is no manse upon the glebe; but
Lord Breadalbane accommodates the minister with a
house.  The glebe, when let, paid 4 L. yearly rent.  As part
of it has been lately improved, it may now be worth
double that sum.  The stipend is 53 L. 6 s. 8 d. Sterling
without any victual, exclusive of 100 merks allowed for
communion elements.  The greatest part of the stipend
was paid in meal and barley, till, in 1708, a process of
augmentation commenced; in consequence of which,
the victual was converted to money, and the stipend ac-
tually diminished, instead of being augmented; and in
this manner it continues.  Exclusive of vicarage in meal
and money, the victual then paid to the minister, was
3 chalders of meal, 10 stone to the boll, and 12 bolls of
barley, equal to 5 firlots, Linlithgow measure, to the boll.
This is evident, as smiths and ferrymen are still paid at
this rate; and several yet living know, that the minister's
stipend consisted of the same weight and measure.  Con-
vinced of this, Lord Breadalbane voluntarily allows the
present incumbent, 20 L. of augmentaion yearly.  But
the other proprietors, who value their lands just now,
equal to one-third of the parish, pay only 4 L. 18 s.7 d.
annualy to the minister.
