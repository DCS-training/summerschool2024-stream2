     Statistical Account

   If so, it may be expected, that the prices may fall some-
what; at present the poor find them to be very high.  And
what is surprising, for 100 years, that is, from 1670,
till 1770, the coals kept nearly at the same price, from
3 d. to 4 d. the load.  Since that period, they have become

no great quantity any where.  The birch is one of our most
beautiful plants.  The mountain ash, and small cherry tree,
