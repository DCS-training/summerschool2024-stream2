lumns in the front of Hopetoun House exhibit the most sa-
tisfactory evidence.  There are likewise very extensive
beds of lime-stone, which is of a superior quality.  These
were wrought to a considerable extent in the beginning of
the last century, and probably at an earlier period.  There
is reason to behave Abercorn was formerly the principal
market for lime on the banks of the Forth, probably before
those valuable works on the opposite coast of Fife com-
menced, which are now carried on with advantage to so
great an extent.  It is said the fortifications of Dunkirk
were built with lime from Abercorn; and the old people
speak of the French vessels employed in carrying it.  Lime
continues to be wrought on the estate of Duddington, but
only for a land sale.  Ten men are usually employed in
quarrying and burning it; and about 10,000 bolls are sold
annually.  It is sold by the Linlithgow pease measure, and
at 1 s. per boll.  The boll of shells produces two and
a half, and sometimes very nearly three bolls of slacked
lime.
   Hitherto no coal has been wrought in the parish, this ne-
cessary article being generally brought from the vicinity of
Borrowstounness, which is between five and six miles distant.
It is, however, by no means improbable, that there is coal, par-
ticularly in the south-west part of the parish.  There are cer-
tain indications of iron-stone in different places, and a small
quantity has been gathered along the shore; but as it has
never been wrought, it is impossible to say of what quality,
and in what quantity, it might be found.  There is some-
thing singular in the lie or bearing of the metals.  The
dip is frequently so great, that the strata appear almost per-
pendicular to the plane of the horizon.  Such is the irregu-
larity, that within the same field they are often found to
bear to opposite points, and frequently contrary to what is
their usual bearing along the banks of the Forth, and in-
