   At any rate, he depends on hearing from you in course; and he hopes
that your letter, will either be accompanied with your account, or that you
will have the goodness to point out the proper person to apply to for infor-
mation, as no time can now be lost.  If the parish does not furnish great
materials, any general information, as to the state of the population, agri-
culture, church, stipend, poor, school, boats, fishermen, &c. will be suffi-
cient, and your name will be prefixed or not, as may be most agreeable.

     No. V.  Circular Letter, written by SIR JOHN SINCLAIR, 25th Au-
         gust 1794.

   SIR,

   I have at last the pleasure of finding, that the remaining deficient parishes
are so few in number, that I can now address the Clergy, without ma-
king use of a borrowed hand.  The last volumes are in the press, and I am
in great hopes that it will be in my power to take the charge of them my-
self.  I beg, therefore, that you would lose no time in sending me the Ac-
count of your parish, as M. S. is much wanted to keep the press a-going.  I
cannot think of leaving Scotland, without having this great undertaking, if
possible, completed; and indeed I told the King, who takes a warm interest
in a Work, which would do credit to the reign of any Sovereign, that I flat-
tered myself, I should be able to present the last volume to his Majesty
when I returned to England.  I remain, with great regard, your very
faithful, humble servant,

     JOHN SINCLAIR.

   EDINBURGH,

   N. B. If the account is not quite ready, I must trouble you to inform
me, in course, when it may be expected, that I may arrange the accounts in
the different volumes accordingly.
