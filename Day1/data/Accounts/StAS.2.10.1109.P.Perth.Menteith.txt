                             PORT OF MENTEITH.                     1109

       this parish was held by an individual who did not preach in that
       tongue.   Nor is there the slightest reason to think that either of
       the Episcopalian clergymen, from the Restoration downward,
       namely, Mr James Donaldson and Mr Patrick Bell, ever officiated
       in the Gaelic tongue.

                            IV.--INDUSTRY.
       The example of the late Lord Kaims, and of his successors in
       the lands of Blair-Drummond, in the neighbouring parish of Kin-
       cardine, has heen followed in the parish of Port by Mr Erskine of
       Cardross, in the establishing of a colony for clearing nff the peat
       from the south-west extremity of Moss-Flanders by runs of water
       into the Forth, and acquiring, as in the case above-mentioned, a
       rich alluvial soil.  Mr Erskine's operations on the Forth were
       commenced about ten years since.
         The prevalent breed of cows in the parish is a cross of the
       Highland and the lowland; and of sheep, the black-faced.
