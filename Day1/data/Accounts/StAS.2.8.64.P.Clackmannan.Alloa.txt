average annual allowance to each individual on the regular roll for
the same period, was L. 1, .14s. 63/4d. In the year 1839, there were

each, and 99 temporary. The causes of this great increase are
various, but we presume the chief of them are,-the increase of the
population since the former period, the great increase of manufac-
tures in the parish, and the increasing improvidence of the work-
ing-classes, arising in a great measure from their intemperate ha-
bits. The amount of contributions for the relief of the poor in
1839 is as follows:-

Besides what is stated in the preceding account, the heritors pay
for the maintenance of several pauper lunatics in the Glasgow Asy-
lum, the expense of which, during 1838, was L. 130, 15s. 4d.; in
1839, L. 91, 8s. 3d.
  A committee of the inhabitants, ever since 1770, have acted in
concert with the heritors and session; the ministers of the other con-
gregations, who contribute to the funds, being members ex offcio-
This plan has been found of much benefit, both to the funds and
to the paupers maintained by them. In 1839, the committee was
enlarged, and their mode of operation much improved. By their
united exertions, the poor- have hitherto been supported without
having recourse to a compulsory assessment; how long that may
continue, cannot be predicted. One principal object of the com-
mittee is to induce the inhabitants to be more liberal in their vo-
luntary contributions, that all may contribute according to their
means and substance, so long as they have it in their power, and
thereby prevent a legal assessment; another, is to limit public
begging as much as possible, and to make some addition to the
allowance of the most necessitous and saber of the poor; for it is
notorious that a few of them do pass the bounds of sobriety, when-
ever they have it in their power.
  The committee of management are materially aided by the
praiseworthy exertions of the " Alloa Female Society for the bene-
fit of Old and Indigent Women," the ladies composing which ge-
nerally distribute above L. 70 annually. In 1839, they gave to
deserving objects, L 78; and they also distribute comfortable cloth-
