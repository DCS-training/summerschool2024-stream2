				III.-POPULATION.
	  The population of Carnbee has decreased considerably. In
	1752 it was 1290. At the date of the last Statistical Account it
	was 1041; in 1811, 1098; in 1821, 1048; in 1831, 1079; and
	in 1841, 1043. The decrease since 1752 is to be ascribed to the
	change in the system of farming.
	  The average number of communicants is 375; of baptisms, 28;
	of marriages, 5; and of deaths, 13.

				IV.-INDUSTRY.
	  The parish is strictly agricultural. It is at present divided into
	32 farms, the largest of which is 390 Scots acres, and the smallest
	about 40, the average being about 150. The system of manage-
	ment is that generally pursued on the stiff clay lands of this part
	of Fife, as tlready described in the reports of parishes similarly
	situated, and it is therefore unnecessary to give a detailed aecount
	of it. The same remark will apply to the produce, rates of wages,
	and the general expense of farm operations.  The rent ranges
	from L. 1, 8s. to L. 3, 2s. per Scotch acre.	Furrow-draining is
	going on vigorously, and cannot fail to effect a  most decided im-
	provement on a soil such as that of which the parish chiefly con-
	sists. Almost the whole of it has been limed.
