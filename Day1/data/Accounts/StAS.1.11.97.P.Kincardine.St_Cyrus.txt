are in a great measure remedied, by the bridges thrown over
the North Esk and Den Fenel, the Burn of Woodston, and the
Den of Laurieston; and it is with pleasure that the author of
this narrative is informed, that government have lately granted
100 L. to heighten the Bridge of Laurieston, which is now the
most difficult pass in this parish.  Yet, after all, the gentle-
men of the county have it in their contemplation, to alter
the line of road greatly for the better; and to introduce turn-
pikes, which are evidently for the public good, as well as for
that of the county, when the expence of forming and keep-
ing them up answers.

   Minerals.-Upon the farm of East Mathers, there is a very
valuable lime-stone quarry.  This farm is rented from the
Viscount of Arbuthnot, by George Carnegie, Esq. of Pit-
tarrow, who took it for the purpose of working the quarry,
to a greater extent and more advantage, than could have been
done by a common farmer.  Only an inconsiderable quantity,
mostly for building and plastering, for which purposes it is
preferred to any other in the country, was sold by the former
tenant.  Indeed, he had neither money nor genius to carry
on the work to any great extent; nor were the benefits of
using lime, as an agricultural manure, so well known, as to
occasion a great demand for it.  The lime rock begins on the
shore about flood mark, and the post is now from 12 to 14
feet deep.  When first discovered and worked, it lay very
near the surface; but it dips in so great a declivity, in a S. W.
direction, that there is now 25 feet of earth, and brittle
red rock, above it.  And as there is no level to carry off the
water, it is drawn off by a pump, worked by two horses, at
great expence.
   The coals, for burning the lime-stone, are brought from the
Frith of Forth, and landed in a small creek near the works,
