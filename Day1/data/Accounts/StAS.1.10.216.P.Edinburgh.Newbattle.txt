cures them a competence, and frugal, which preserves them
in the possession of this blessing; after which, it is unneces-

condition.
   Newbattle Abbey, the seat of the Marquis of Lothian, is a
large modern building; and the plan of it, especially within,
discovers the taste and judgment of the architect.  In the
library are several manuscripts in folio, written upon vellum,
in the Saxon character; and every page of them is adorned
with pictures, emblematic of the respective subjects of which
they treat.  Of these books, the most highly finished are,
     Jean Boccace des cas des nobles Hommes et Femmes, 1409.
     John Takyt hymni.
     Fitus Livins, per P. Berceun.
     Augustin de la Cite‚ de Dieu.

And, in all of them, the figures are coloured and gilded
with so much delicacy and richness, as to afford a very inte-
resting specimen of the labour and elegance with which they
have been executed.  These manuscripts had, in former
times, belonged to the Abbey, the monks of which were of
the Cistertian order.  It was founded and endowed by Da-
vid I.  A wall surrounded it, which is almost entire, and re-
tains the name of the Monkland wall.  The modern house is
raised upon the spot which was formerly occupied by the
monastery, and stands surrounded by a level lawn, containing
about 30 acres of ground.  It is watered, on the one side, by
the river South Esk, which, after toiling through the rocks
of Cockpen, flows along the park in a quiet stream, and is
over-hung with flourishing plantations.  On the other side
it is skirted by a waving line of woods, which, complying
with the ascents and swellings of the banks, are seen rising
above one another, and exhibit a beautiful variety of shades.
