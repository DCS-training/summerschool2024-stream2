   2. Several parts of the same farms are dry and arable,
but have not been in tillage for at least 100 years past.
These, in their present state, are worth very little:  Were
they taken up and well limed, and, after a crop or two of
oats, fown with white clover feed, their value would be
considerably increased.  They would become most excel-
lent pasture grounds either for sheep or cattle.
   3. The greatest improvement that could be made in
this parish, would be to plant some of the high grounds
with such trees as best suited the soil.  Plantations, when
judiciously made, are ornaments to the richest and best
cultivated districts: but on high and exposed places, they
are not only ornamental, but greatly beneficial.  They
break the violence of the winds, and render the air more
mild and temperate.  In few parts of the country do the
winds rage with greater fury than on some of the high
grounds in this parish: yet these are almost all quite bare,
and destitute of trees.  It is unnecessary to point out all
the various places where plantations might be made to
advantage; it may be proper, however, to mention the
following:  Were a stripe of plantation drawn across the
parish, about half a mile to the S. of the town of Green-
law, it would be both a great ornament to the country
in general, and a vast benefit to the lands through which
it passed.  Another stripe, about the same distance N.
from the town, drawn likewise across the parish, would
be no less ornamental and advantageous.  Besides these,
several clumps of trees ought to be raised in places far-
ther N.  In severe winters, when the frosts are intense
and of long continuance, and the ground covered with
snow, all these various plantations would be of singulars
benefit.  They would afford a constant shelter to the
