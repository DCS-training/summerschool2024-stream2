   If we take an average of five years, beginning with 1831, for mar-
riages, births, and deaths, we shall find that, during that period,
there were 126 marriages, 476 births (386 for Churchmen, and
about 90, at 18 per annum, for Dissenters,) and 151 deaths, giv-
ing an average of 25 marriages, 95 births, and 30 deaths yearly.
In reference to the whole population, this is nearly one marriage
to every 115 individuals, one birth to 30, and one death to 95.
From the preceding tables, it will be seen that, as might be ex-
pected, the greatest number of deaths in each year is among per-
sons under five, or above seventy years of age, the former class ave-
raging 51, and the latter 41, in five years.  The great number of
children dying in infancy, among a population so healthy, is de-
serving of notice.  Of thirteen children who died under five years
of age in 1834, only one had reached the age of four years ; 2, six
months; 4, two months; 2, one month; and 4 were only a few
days or hours old.  Is there not reason to believe that the treat-
ment of infants among the labouring classes admits of much im-
provement? In five years, there were only three still-born chil-
dren, or about one in 50 births.  The proportion of twin-births is
nearly the same.  The proportion of male to female births is as
11 to 10. One in 20 marriages is unproductive, and the rest have
about 3 children per marriage.  The ratio of marriages dur-
ing the five years above referred to, is, to every 100 inhabitants,
about 3 1/4; of births, 12 1/3 nearly; and of deaths something short
of 3.
   The number of families in the parish by last census was 514,
and of inhabited houses 423, shewing that there were 91 more
families than houses; families living in villages 276, and in the
country 238; inhabited houses in the country 154; in villages
269.  Average number of individuals to each house upwards of 6,
and to each family about 5, viz. 6 in villages, and 4 in the country.
Males upwards of twenty years of afe, 617.  Inhabitants to the
square mile about 261.  There may be said to be no uninhabited
houses in the parish at present, except a few in the country in a
dilapidated and ruinous state, and which in all likelihood will never
be repaired.  The number of houses in course of erection by build-
ing societies varies at very short intervals, but may be stated as
being at present about 6 or 8 in the course of the year.
   The following classification, made in 1835 and 1836, will shew
