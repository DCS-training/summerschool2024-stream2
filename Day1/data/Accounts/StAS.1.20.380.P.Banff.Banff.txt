   Among ranks higher in the scale of society, there is per-

manners of the age; too much attention to the pleasures of
the table, and too much of refinement in many things which
administer to luxury.
   Although the limits which separate harmless gaiety from
blameful dissipation are seldom transgressed, a grave mora-

convivial festivity are, at some seasons, too incessant and too
laborious.  He might even farther allege, that men, not al-
ways contented with a little wine for their stomach's sake,
are sometimes persuaded to increase the quantity, in order,
perhaps to "remove the natural reserve of their manner.
" and give a proper degree of ease and spirit to their con-

   Were honest Mr Umphraville to pass the winter in this
northern burgh, he might occasionally have reason to com-
plain, that the drawing rooms, where, in his younger days,
the ladies and gentlemen were accustomed to meet each

the boasted refinement of modern manners, the gentlemen
paid less attention to the ladies than they had done 50 years
ago*.
   In politics, as in religion, there subsists among us some
difference of opinion, not tinctured, however, with the vi-
rulence of party spirit.  Here, it is believed, there are
very few who may be said to belong to the order of modern
Illuminati, or to the class of violent malecontents+.
