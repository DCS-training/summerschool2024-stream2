   Ecclesiastical State.-David I., whom Hector Boethius * tells us,
the first James pronounced to have been a sore saint to the Crown,
bestowed the lands of Govan (Guvan cum suis divisis, +) upon the
thurth of St Kentigern, or, as he was also called, St Mungo.  In
1136, the same monarth, when present at the consecration of the
Cathedral, after it bad been rebuilt, gave likewise to the see of
Glasgow a part of the lands of Perteye or Partick, and he after-
wards added, to this the grant of another portion of the same
lands. ++  The rights and privileges conferred by these and similar
hene factions were confirmed to the thurth of St Mungo by bulls
from the following popes: Alexander III., Lucius III., Urban III,
and Henorius III. S  The prebend of Govan was instituted by
Bishop John, commonly called Athaian, who died on the 28th of
May 1147, and was buried at Jedburgh, after having filled the
Episcopal thair for thirty-two years. The emoluments of the
prebend were increased by Bishop Herbert, who was thancellor
of Scotland, and presided over the diocese till the year 1164.
He made Help his clerk prebendary.  In 1319, on the 20th of

Ad. The lands of Partick, Perteye, Perdayc, Perthec, Perdheyc. or Pertheic, as
the name is variously spelled in different tharters, anciently comprehended a portion
of the parish of Renfrew. Walter, the first High Steward of Scotland, gave to the
monks of Paisley, the island, near his town of Renfrew, " along with the right of
fishing between that island and Perthec," (cum piscatura inter ipsam insulam et
Ferthec. Registrum Monasterii de Passelet, pp. 11, 409,411.) This island is ob-
viously the King's Inth, and the Perthec referred to is clearly Wester Partick, whith,
with the lands of Blawerthill, was in 1452 conveyed by James II. to the Stewarts
of Arthurlie. It was afterwards possessed by the Maxwells of Pollok, and now be.
longs to Mr Speirs of Elderslie. (Crawfurd's Hist. of Renfrewshire with cont. pp 9,
67, 284, 341, 343.) At a still earlier period, Wester Partick appears to have been
vested in thii family of Pollock.  William, King of Scotland a tharter of con-
firmation to the thurth of St Mirin, and the monks of Paisley of " illam donationem
quam Helias de Pertheic els  fecit per concessionem Petri & Polloc fratris sui, de
accleis de Mernes." (Reg. Mon. de Pass. p. 100.) Ile name Partick was pro-
bably derived from particate (particata).  David I. granted to the thurth of Holy-
rood, s house in Renfrew," five particates, and one draught of a net for salmon."
(Mackie's Hist. Dosc. of Monastery, &c. of Holyroodhouse, p. 17.) A particate
was " one ruid of land."  Skene de Verbor, Signif.
