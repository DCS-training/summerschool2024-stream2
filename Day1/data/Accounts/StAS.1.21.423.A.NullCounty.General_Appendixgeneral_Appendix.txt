worth from ten to eighteen shilllings.  How much animal
food may be consumed in the parish I am uncertain; but
not less than one thousand pounds worth of live stock are
sold out of it annually.  In this parish there are four corn
mills, one waulk mill, and a lint mill.  In the latter, not less
than five hundred stone of lint are dressed yearly, which is
raised mostly in the parish.  Formerly there was a sufficient

and a half of victual; but an augmentation was obtained in
1796, and it is now three hundred and thirty-six pounds Scots,
and thirteen bolls of victual; to that at an average, the

soil, and about three acres more for which the Minister, for
time immemorial, has paid no more than twenty-two shillings
sterling, little more than seven shillings per acre.  By the good-
