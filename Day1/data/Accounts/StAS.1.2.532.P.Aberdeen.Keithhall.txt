     Statistical Account

40 years age, by the best accounts that can be procured, there
were at least double the number of black cattle, in this district,
and more that 5 sheep where there are 2 at present.  And in a
few years hence, it is probable, there will not be one half of
the present number.  The number of horses alone has increas-
ed, since black cattle came to be less used in the plow.  In
1778, there were 26 oxen ploughs, each plough consisting of
10 or 12 oxen, besides other small plough.  At present there
are only 8 plough, which have to oxen in the plough.  The
number of young cattle has also decreased since 1782 and 1783.
At that time many farmers were obliged to sell all off, or
great part of their oxen; and thay have not yet been able to
supply their place, though they raise as many young ones as
they can, to pay their sents and stock their farms.  Almost all
the stock of black cattle are reared in the district itself.  A-
bout 20 horses are of the west country, or Irish breed; the
self are home-bred, and of the kind called Galloways.  They
are lighter, live longer, are more hardly, and easier kept than
the other; and seem to retain a little of the original blood.  A
great number of them have been carried to the southern coun-
ties within these 8 years past.

   Product.-  Oats, bear, barley, pease, turnips, potatoes,
a few carrots, and a good many greens and cabbages, are the
principal productions of the district.  There may be 3000 acres
in oats of different kinds; near 300 in barley; 100 in clover,
and rye-grats; and from 36 to 40 acres in turnips.  The an
cient husbandry, within there 10 or 18 years, is beginning to
wear out;- and, with proper encouragement, the farmers
would inclose and improve their farms.  The district supplies
itself with provisions; and sends a considerable quantity to
Aberdeen.
