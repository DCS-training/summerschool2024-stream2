     Statistical Account

summer, by fallow or a green crop, begins to gain ground.  It
is thought, that barley sown thus early, is not so liable to
suffer from drought, as when sown in the middle or end of
May; that the crop is sooner ready, and the grain larger and
better ripened.  In favourable seasons, September is the har-
vest month.  But if the weather is bad, harvest is not over
till the middle or end of October.  This is not altogether to
be attributed to climate; but in fume measure to a practice
that still prevails, of sowing great quantities of oats upon high
lands, which nature seems to have intended for pasture only.
There is a considerable variety of climate in the parish.  In
the town of Hawick, and its immediate neighbourhood, the
weather is often mild, when it is cold and sharp a few miles
distant.  In the winter season, snow, on the high parts of the
parish, is often deep, while near the town there is none.  The
provisions produced in the parish, are more than sufficient far
the supply of the country part of it, but not equal to the con-
sumption of the town of Hawick.  On this account, there is a
constant importation from the neighbouring parishes of meal,
harley for malt, butcher meat, butter, cheese, poultry, etc.
