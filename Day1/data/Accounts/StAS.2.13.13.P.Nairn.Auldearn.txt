      Modern Buildings.--Of these  mansion-houses of Lethen and
   Boath alone are worthy of particular notice. The former, the re-
   sidence of James C. Brodie, Esq. is the older of the two, having
   been built last century. It consists of a large main building of
   three stories, with two wings of less height and of unequal dimen-
   sions. It is situated in the southern part of the parish, on the
   higher ground of the valley of the Muckleburn. Seen from the
   opposite side of the valley with large old beeches immediately sur-
   rounding it, and the beautifully wooded banks of the stream slop-
   ing below, it contributes to form one of the finest landscapes in the
   county.
     The mansion-house of Boath, the seat of Sir Frederick Wil-
   liam Dunbar, is an elegant building of three stories, erected about
   1830, of freestone taken from a quarry on the property, but not
   within the parish of Auldearn. It stands in the valley of the burn
   of Auldearn, at the meeting of the two principal branches of that
   stream, and a little to the north of the church and manse, The
   garden, lawn, and shrubberies are not extensive, but are well and
   tastefully laid out. The freestone, of a beautiful whiteness, has
   retained its colour almost uninjured by the elements.

                      <TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>

      In 1755, the population is said to have amounted to 1951.
   The following are its various amounts during several of the years
   since that period:

               Year.       Males.      Females.       Total.
               1796,   .    661    .     745       .   1406
               1801,   .           .               .   1402
               1821,   .    723    .     800       .   1523
               1831,   .    752    .     861       .   1613
               1841,   .    704    .     753       .   1457

      Of the population, there are 360 resident in the village,  and
   1097 in the rest of the parish. A considerable decrease in the
   latter, from the enlargement of farms, is partly compensated by a
   corresponding increase in the former. In 1797, the village con-
   tained 41 houses, and 185 inhabitants. It now contains 86 houses,
   and, as stated above, 360 inhabitants.
      From a register kept by the parochial schoolmaster, the num-
   ber of births, deaths, and marriages, for the last seven years
   would appear to be as follows:
