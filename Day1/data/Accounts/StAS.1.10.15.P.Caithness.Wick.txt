   Minerals.-Near the castle of Old Wick, in the face of a
rock, a copper mine was discovered; and from the appearance
of the ore, some miners entered into a contract with the pro-
prietor, and had begun to work it, but the scheme was drop-

some other parts of the parish, there are inexhaustible stores
of limestone.  At Old Wick, the lime has been burnt by Mr
Dunbar of Hempriggs and his predecessors, at from 9 d. to
10 d. per boll.  The quarry there is interlarded with flags use-
ful for paving*.  The county abounds with stones, very fit for
building, which might be much more employed than they are
at present for drains and inclosures, the want of which great-
ly retards the progress of improvement.  Some small stones
have been found, which seem to be a species of flint, about
an inch long and half an inch broad, of a triangular shape,
and barbed on each side.  The common people confidently as-
sert, that they are fairies arrows, which they shoot at cattle,
when they instantly fall down dead, though the hide of the
animal remains quite entire.  Some of those arrows have been
found buried a foot under ground, and are supposed to have
been in antient times fixed in shafts, and shot from bows.
Some stones also of a flinty nature have been found, which
when broken contained the shape of serpents coiled round in
the heart of the stone.

hours.
