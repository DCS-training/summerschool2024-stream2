   Heritors, Rent, and Fuel.-The heritors are 7 in number;
none of whom reside, excepting one gentleman, a few months
in summer.  There is only one gentleman's seat in the parish;
but Airly Castle will soon make another.-The valued rent is
3310 L. Scotch.  The real rent is about 2850 L. Sterling, in-
cluding what arises from moss and marl.  The former will
bring for peats, the chief fuel of the lower class, near 100 L.,
and the latter about 300 L.

   Church, School, and Poor.-The church was rebuilt in
1783, and the manse in 1792.  The living is 85 bolls 3 fir-
lots 1 peck 1/3 lippie meal, and 43 bolls 3 firlots bear, with
about 9 L. of vicarage tithes, a glebe and garden.  The Earl
of STRATHMORE is patron.-The schoolmaster's salary and
school fees amount to about 16 L. or 17 L.-The poor are sup-
plied by the weekly collections, mortcloth money, and the
interest of about 150 L.  The number upon the roll, during
the last 10 years, has been from 4 to 9, besides many who
have received occasional supplies.  In 1782, 20 L. Sterling
were expended in purchasing meal for the most necessitous
families.

   Population.-The number of parishioners has decreased
within these 40 years, owing to the improvements of land
and junction of farms, which have also greatly diminished the
number of inhabited houses.
