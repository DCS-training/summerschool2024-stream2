ready for severely felt in many parishes, and which must 
soon materially injure the real strength and population of 
Scotland.  The introduction of these article, is one bad ef-
fect of the present practice of debating and vitiating malt 
liquor.  Formerly, when that liquor was the only beverage in 
use, excesses from it did not affect the constitution, as it con-
taine a good deal of nourishment,  But now, since it has been 
debated, it is entirely given up.  Tea, as a dietetic article, is 
substituted in its place, and it is not uncommon to see a la-

copper mine, but they failed.-The wages of servants of all 
kinds, are, within these 30 years, more than doubled.  1 s.
a-day, and maintenance, are common in harvest; labour-
ers, formerly at 5 d. and 6 d. a-day, are now at 1 s and 
1 s. 2 d.  Services of every kind are here abolished; ex-
