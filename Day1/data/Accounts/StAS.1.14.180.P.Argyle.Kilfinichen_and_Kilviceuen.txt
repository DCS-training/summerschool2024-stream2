     Statistical Account

   It has been already observed, that 2 loch, or arms of
the sea, indent the parish; the one called Lochseridair,
and the other Lochlahich.  Lochseridair abounds in her-
ring of the most excellent quality.  In the year 1792, hun-
dreds of vessels might be loaded, but want of intelligence
prevented the busses from coming in till late in the sea-
son.  The country people killed great quantities.  At
first, the hundred was sold from 6 d. to 8 d: it sell gradu-
ally to 2 d: at last some rotted from want of salt, and
it was entirely given up for the season.  In the year
1793, many busses were loaded in this loch.  The her-
ring of Lochlahich is not of so good a quality, nor was
any great quantity got there in any one year since the
incumbent was settled in the parish.  From the situation
of these two loch, Lochseridair and Lochlahich, and the
different quality of the herring caught in them, one
would be apt to doubt the generally received hypothesis
of the annual migration of the herring into the north
seas, and the shoals returning again at a certain season.
If the herring, suppose only from these two lochs, mi-
grated to the north seas, as the herring of Lochseridair
must pass by Lochlahich, they would, in all probability,
mix before their return, and some of the sat herring of
the one loch would mix with the poor herring of the
other.  But this is never the case.  But if the herring
migrated, why not the herring of every loch equally
good at first, and make appearance earlier in the
northern than in the southern loch?  Some fishers
in the parish pretend to say, that the herring never leave
the lochs, but, after spawning, go to the bottom, where
they remain, till they gather strength enough to encoun-
ter the streams*.
