   It will still require many years, before these very extensive
plantations can be filled up with oaks; but there is at present,
in the nurseries, a very large stock of young plants coming
forward.  The other proprietors have not been deficient in

Upon the estate of Dunphail, there are some old fir plantations,
which have been cutting down, and selling for the use of the
country, for several years past.

there is a curious testimony in favour of the country, in
Oliver Cromwell's time:  He says, "Ashfield's regiment was
