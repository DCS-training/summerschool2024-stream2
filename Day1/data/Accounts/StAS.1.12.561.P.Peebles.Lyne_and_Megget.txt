what would otherwise have been laid upon for the evil day.
Some of the neighbouring parishes are striking instances of the
truth of this observation.  In our sister kingdom, the evil is
still growing worse and worse.  If not speedily corrected, the
burden of poor's rates will, in a short time, become altogether
grievous and oppressive.

   Sheep.-Both in Megget and Lyne, the sheep are all of the
black-faced, common Scotch kind, and they are not inferior
in quality to any of that kind in this part of Scotland.  Af-
ter repeated experiments, the farmers in this district, are con-
vinced that their own breed is more hardy, of a better shape,
and more easily fed than any other breed with which they are
acquainted.  Besides, they maintain, that there is a greater
demand from England for Scotch sheep, than for those of any
other kind.  For these reasons, they apprehend that it would
be very dangerous for them, whose dependence is solely upon
their sheep, to attempt any innovation, in this respect, unless
it were done on a very small scale.  Upon the banks of Yar-
row water, a cross breed, with finer wool, has been gaining
ground for some time past, but they are found not to thrive
so well when carried to the higher grounds in Tweeddale.  It
is true, that an attempts has been lately made, with consider-
able success, to change the breed upon a farm near the head
of Moffat water; but it ought to be considered, that though
some of the land in that farm be among the highest in the S.
of Scotland, yet a considerable part of it is not only low,
but sheltered in such a manner, that when the farms in Meg-
get are completely stormed with snow, the sheep on that farm
are at no loss for pasture.  It is admitted, that the wool of
the black-faced sheep, is, in general, very coarse, but per-
haps considerable improvement might be made on it, by pay-
ing more attention than is usually done, to the fleece of the
