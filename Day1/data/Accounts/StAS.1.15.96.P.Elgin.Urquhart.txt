prospect of success.  The farms also are of too small extent
for carrying on any substantial improvements in agriculture.
There are a few that may contain from 60 to 100 acres
but the common run is from 20 to 30.

   Farm Rents and Ploughs, etc.-The rent of land varies
according to the nature of the soil; there are some fields let
for 20 s. per acre, while others are below 10 s.; the average
rent may be from 10 s. to 15 s.  The ploughs, of which there
are above 100, some of English, some of Scotch construction,
are drawn chiefly by a pair of horses.  In this branch of
farming, an improvement has been introduced about 20 years
ago, which now begins to be pretty generally adopted; that
is, plowing with two oxen, harnesled in the saunc manner as
horses.  This method is warmly recommended, and the ad-
vantages of it fully explained by the late Lord KAIMES, in his
book called The Gentleman Farmer.

   Produce, Exports, etc.  The produce of this parish, con-
sists principally of barley and oats; besides supplying the in-
habitants, it exports annual y a considerable quantity of grain;
which must increase yearly, partly by the increasing improve-
ments of agriculture, but chiefly by the use of potatoes, which
are now almost universally cultivated, and during a great part
of the year, are, in a manner, the principal subsistence of a
considerable number of the inhabitants.  This food, which
at first was not in general use, becomes more and more so e-
very day, from the various modes that have been discovered
of dressing it, by different seasonings, at little or no expence.
They make an excellent dish with milk, but above all with
onions, which are raised in abundance in this county, and
sold at such a moderate price, as to come within the reach
of the poorest inhabitant.
