	It is observable that the second half year exceeds the first by
L. 1, 1s. 7d.; the total-amount of the whole year is L. 6, 7s. 5d.
The average number of deaths is nearly 52; this will give as the ave-
rage price of each mortcloth for rich and poor 2s. 5d. The ex-
cess of L. 1, 1s. 7d. on the latter half of the year, will give fully
eight more deaths for that half than for the former half. There
are in the parish about 28 public houses where ardent spirits are
sold.

	          MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	This and the neighbouring parishes depend in a great measure
on Glasgow; which is the great mart to which the inhabitants re-
sort, both for buying and selling. The improvements in Glasgow, and
the great increase of its population, have extended in a considera-
ble degree to the districts around. An increasing demand for-
the articles which land produces, a ready market, and favourable,
though not extravagant prices, give life and vigour to the exertions
of the farmer. Growing wealth has created new wants, and the
habits of the people and their means of subsistence have been gra-
dually improving. The rental of the parish has been more than
doubled since the publication of last report, and the gross amount
of raw produce has also undergone a proportional increase. The
population is more than doubled, and seems to be still on the in-
crease.
