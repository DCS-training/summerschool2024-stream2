   This decrease in the population since 1792 is chiefly to be as-
cribed to the union of small farms, and the consequent diminution
in the number of farm-servants.

   It may be noticed, as an instance of the longevity of fisher-
men, that there is at present a boat's crew of four men belonging
to the villages of Ross and Burnmouth, whose united ages amount
to 301 years. Though no longer able for the rougher toils of their
mode of life, they employ themselves in lobster-catching.
   Character of the People.-The inhabitants of this parish are in
general frugal and industrious, orderly in their habits, and con-
tented with their condition. They present an illustration of the
high superiority of the purely agricultural districts over the manu-
facturing, in regard to the general character of the population.
No inhabitant of the parish has been convicted of a crime before
a court of justice in the memory of man.
   As this parish lies on the border between Scotland and Eng-
land, the illicit traffic of smuggling Scotch whisky into England
is carried on to a considerable extent at two public-houses on the
turnpike-roads to Berwick-on-Tweed. Those who engage, how-
ever, in this unlawful employment, are persons of low character from
Berwick, who buy the spirits at these two public-houses, and convey
them secretly into England. A guard of excise officers, which is
maintained by Government at considerable expense, traverses the
roads,-by which means the traffic has lately somewhat decreased,
but it is still carried on to a considerable extent; and its demo-
ralizing influence on those engaged in it, is lamentably apparent.
No remedy, however, seems likely to avail, but an equalizing of the
duties on spirits in the two countries.

   This parish may be regarded as exclusively agricultural; for,
with the exception of the small fishing village of Ross, it is entire-
