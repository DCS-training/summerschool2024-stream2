       the gleanings of the harvest; from all which, shelter, constant
       fuel, and limited supplies of food are certain,-while in most dils-

       vate to the necessities of the deserving poor.  Under such cir-
       cumstances as these, a few shillings in addition from the parish
       funds are more valuable than the same sums among the poor of
       towns.  In this part of,the north of Scotland, the indigent poor
       are never neglected ; but in order to continue to act towards them
       as their wants require, it is now found absolutely necessary to pro-
       tect the northern inhabitants from the hordes of vagrants who have
       been wandering, of late years, from the southern parts of the king-
       dom, over the northern counties, and carrying with them all the
       moral and physical diseases of crowded cities in their most dread-
       ed forms.
