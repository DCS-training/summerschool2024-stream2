144			KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE.

	Fuel.--Peat is the kind of fuel chiefly used: wood is also ex-
tensively used. Coals are principally consumed by the better class
of inhabitants; and are mostly procured from Whitehaven and ad-
jacent ports.

                    MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	The more striking variations betwixt the present state of the
parish and that which existed at the time of the former account
are,--the population has increased from 1420 to 1826. The ren-
tal of the parish has nearly doubled in amount, it having been, in
1793, L. 5925, while at present it is L. 10,418, exclusive of sub-
rents, which may augment the sum to L. I1,000,--one farm, which
is let at L. 42, being subset at L. 200. Not the least striking cir-
cumstance, is the increase of pauperism. While the population
has only increased 28 per cent., the expenditure of the poor's fund
has increased 450 per cent, or from L. 30 in 1793 to L. 138, 8s.
8 3/4d. in 1841, and it is not lavishly expended.
	February 1842.
