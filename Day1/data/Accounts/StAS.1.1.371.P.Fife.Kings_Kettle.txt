appeared; owing, most probably, to the many drains that
have been made in this and the neighbouring parishes.  The
common people are now peculiarly liable to dropsical swell-
ings of the limbs.  During the above mentioned period po-
tatoes have been introduced, and new form the principal part
of the sustenance of the poorer householders.  It may per-
haps be suspected, that this change of diet has produced some
alternation in the constitutions of the inhabitants.

   Rivers, Springs, etc.-There are no considerable lakes or
rivers in the parish.  The Eden, whose stream in summer is
scarcely sufficient for a corn mill, abounds with excellent red
and white trout, pike, and eels.  There are several springs,
some of which are supposed to be impregnated with mine-
rals.  The course of the Eden being down a low strath, bor-
dered on each side by hills for a considerable distance above
Kettle, and the river having very little fall, frequently over-
flowed its banks, so that the crops on its carse haughs were
always precarious, a plan was projected of making a cut so
deep as to confine the water; but it was never executed,
owing to the disagreement of the proprietors of the lands
which lye on the opposite sides of the river.  About 10 years
ago Mr Johnston purchased the whole, and formed the pro-
jected cut on an enlarged plan.  A spacious canal was made
for the water, 12 feet wide at the bottom, and 30 at the top,
secured on the sides by raised banks and hedges, which in-
clude a space of 70 feet in breath, and serve to confine the
water at high floods.  This cut has been carried on a consi-
derable way, but not with equal effect, as the direction of the
stream was obliged to be accommodated to the convenience
of persons with whose property it interferred.  Mr Johnston,
since his residence at Lathifk in 1783, has built an elegant
house on the estate.  He has also got several of the farms in-
