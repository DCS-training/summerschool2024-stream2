     Statistical Account.

is not easy to calculate the earnings of a common labourer,
or the expence of his family, for the year.  As there are no
works of any importance or extent carrying on, they cannot
have regular employment.  Though, therefore, a labourer
has 1 s. per day, the amount of his earnings at the year's end
may not exceed 9 l. or 10 l.  Out of this he must pay a smart
rent for the miserable hut which helps to shelter him.  He
must serve his superior for 12 days.  His children, until they
are fit for herding, are a dead weight upon him; and his
wife can contribute little to the common stock; for the must,

of vassalage.  Yet, under all these disadvantages, they make

were dragged from a distance, and up hill; and these stones
were all placed lengthways, towards the center of the wall.
The dimensions of one of these towers was taken.  It is of a
circular form, a figure which the situation of the ground
compelled them in general to adopt.  The diameter is 27
feet, the breadth of the wall 7, and the height 12 feet, as
far as can be conjectured from the ruins that lie scattered
at the foot of it.  Upon the whole, those wretched retreats
of barbarity and violence afford a striking proof of the
strength and perseverance of the inhabitants at that early
