districts of Galloway and Nithsdale*.  A branch of this
clan was afterwards ennobled by the title of Kirkcudbright.
The honours remain, but the family possessions are long since
alienated.

   Bounds.-The parish of Balmaclellan is of an oblong figure.
The river Kenn forms its western boundary; and Urr, flowing
from a lake or loch of that name on the eastern extremity of
the parish, becomes its march for about two thirds of the
whole breadth.  The north and southern boundaries are
marked by rivulets, which, proceeding generally from the
intervening lakes, fall differently towards the Kenn or Urr.

   Appearance.-The surface of the parish is generally moor-
ish and, of the whole, scarely one fourth supposed arable,
It exhibits more of a level appearance than most of the pa-
rishes in its neighbourhood.  It is not, however, without its
eminences, a considerable range of pretty high hills stretch-
ing themselves along its northern march.  From the top of
these, although by no means the highest in this tract of
country, in serene weather, may be discovered the sea at 20
miles distance with the larger shipping of the Solway Frith,
objects which, in this inland situation, deserve not to pass
without attention.  Towards the land, the country generally
opens to a range nearly of the same extent, presenting the
observer with a very enlarged, but rugged landskip.  Hills
rising behind each other by degrees confound the view, which
is at last terminated by the lofty tops of Goatfield in Arran,
the hill of Enterkin, and the Cumbrian mountains, some of
which are not less than 60 miles distant.
   Of the surface of the parish about 760 acres are supposed
to be covered with wood, and nearly 20 or 25 with water.
