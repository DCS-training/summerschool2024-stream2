		PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Situation and Boundaries.--THE parish of Ballantrae lies in the
southern extremity of Ayrshire, in the district of Carrick. It is
bounded an the north and north-east by the parish of Colmonell;
on the east and south-east, by the parish of New Luce; on the south,
by that of Inch; and on the west by Lochryan and the Irish sea.
It is about 10 miles in length from north to south, and nearly as
many from west to east.
	Name.--Its name is said to be Celtic, and signifies the town upon
or above the shore, which is the actual situation of the town of
Ballantrae. The ancient name of the parish was Kirkcudbright
Innertig; but in 1617, an act of Parliament was passed for remov-
ing the parish church from the mouth of the river Tig to the town
of Ballantrae, and hence the name of the town gradually became
the name of the parish.
	Surface, &c.--The surface is considerably diversified by hill and
dale, being a succession of low ridges nearly parallel to each other,
running from west to east, and in general rising in height as they
recede from the coast. There are four such ridges, of which the
highest is the third reckoning from the north. In this ridge, the
highest hill is Beinerard, which is 1430 feet above the level of the
sea. It was one of the signal stations in the late trigonometrical
survey, and commands a very extensive and beautiful prospect, com-
prehending the Isle of Man, the north-east of Ireland, Cantire,
Ailsa, Arran, the Ayrshire coast as far north as the Cumbraes,
the whole being terminated by the west Highland mountains in the
distance,--and in another direction, the Dumfries-shire hills, the
Cumberland and Westmoreland mountains, with the interjacent,
Solway.
	Topographical Appearances.--The parish has upwards of ten
miles of sea coast, but the whole of the shore is bold and rocky,
