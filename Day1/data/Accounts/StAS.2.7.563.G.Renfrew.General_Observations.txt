during the corresponding period of 1840. The passengers who
travelled on the Ayr line during the year preceding 30th August
1841, were upwards of 900,000.
  There are three canals connected with this county.
  1. The Glasgow, Paisley, and Johnstone Canal, extending be-
tween Glasgow and Jobnstone,about eleven miles. It was at first pro-
posed to carry the cut as far as Ardrossan. It was opened in 1811.
By the application of lightly constructed passage boats, dragged at
a rapid rate by horses, the revenue of this canal has been greatly
increased ; the number of passengers conveyed during the year
ending 30th Septdmber 1840, was no less than 396,248, besides
76,393 tons of various sorts of goods.
  2. The Forth and Cart Junction Canal, was suggested by Dr
Boog in the last Statistical Account of Paisley, Vol. vii. p. 78.
It is one mile and a half in length, forming a branch from the
Forth and Clyde Canal to the Clyde, terminating nearly opposite
the mouth of the Cart. The company was incorporated by an
Act passed in 1836, with a capital of L.10,000. The canal is
now completed, and is now chiefly used for the transport of coals,
ironstone, and miscellaneous goods, from districts connected with
the great canal to Paisley.
  3.  A canal, particularly mentioned in the former Statistical Ac-
count of Paisley, was cut to avoid the shallows of Inchinnan
Bridge. It was finished at an expense of L.4000. The tonnage
in 1835 brought L.260 per annum.
   Improvements have of late years been carrying on to a conside-
rable extent in the river Cart. In the account of Paisley, it is
said, "these, when finished, will greatly increase the revenue aris-
ing from it, as well as improve the commercial interests of the
place." Unfortunately, these generous anticipations have not been
realised. The affairs of the river Cart are now a complete wreck,
and, like the revenues of the corporation of Paisley, are verging to
insolvency. In the last report of the income and expenditure of
the river C`rt Trust it appears that, while the expenditure in the
year 1841 was L. 1667, 11s. 9d. the revenue was only L.937, 6s.
8d. being an excess of expenditure over income, amounting to
L.730, 5s. 1d. One of the most melancholy features in the case
is the item of debentures, L.9296, due sundries, for savings banks.
This, with an equal sum, at least, raised in the same way, upon
the credit of the town's funds, comes entirely out of the pockets
of the industrious and working-classes. We cannot believe the
surmise that these bubble banks were set up in the spirit of extreme
