a stream of water passing hard by is called Peter's Burn.
There is a fair held in the month of July in the village, call-
ed Peter's Day Houstoun, the more modern name of the
parish, may be supposed to be a corruption of Hew's town,
perhaps from Hugo de Padvinan, who is said by Mr Craw-
furd, in his History of Renfrewshire, to have obtained a grant
of the barony of Kilpeter from Baldwin of Biggar, sheriff of
Lanark in the reign of Malcolm IV.  When families began.
to assume surnames from their hereditary lands and baronies,
his descendants may be supposed to have assumes the name
of Hew's town; and, in process of time, might be changed
into Houstoun.  One of Hugo de Padvinan's successors, who
lived in the reign of King Alexander III. is called, in an an-
cient charter, Sir Finlay de Houstoun; which surname con-
tinued in the family for several hundred years.  We are also
informed by Mr Crawfurd, that Patrick, one of Hugh de
Padvinan's successors, obtained the honour of knighthood
from James V. of Scotland; perhaps a renewal and confir-
mation of a former grant of that honour to his predecessors.
The barony of Houstoun comprehends the whole parish of
Houstoun, and a small part of Killallan.  Before the union
of the two parishes, there was not a single fever in the parish
and barony of Houstoun.  About 50 years ago, it was sold
to Sir John Schaw of Greenock; and soon after, by him, to
Sir James Campbell from Jamaica; and by his heirs to Go-
vernour Macrae.  It has been in the possession of several pro-
prietors since it went out of the Houstoun family, and is now
the property of Archibald Speirs, Esq; of Elderslie.  The
present barony officer, a man near 80, says, he remembers to
have seen 14 lairds or proprietors of Houstoun.
