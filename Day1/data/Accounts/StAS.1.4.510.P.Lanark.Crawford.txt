orders.  When, by certain words, or rather vocal sounds,
he hath learned anew the will of his master, he sets off
again, and mover the sheep in whateger direction he is 
commanded.  But in a severe winter, the business is more
serious.  When it drifts, the shepherds are obliged to
stand upon the hills all night with the sheep, lest they
should be suffocated in the snow, which sometimes hap-

sheep are seldom fed upon hay.  

   Stipend, School, Poor.-The stipend is L. 1000 Scots.
The king is patron; but some say, that the right is vested
in the family of Douglas.  The church, manse, and school-
house are old buildings, and not in good repair.-The
schoolmaster's salary L. 100 Scots.  The children at
school, considering our population, and the distance of some
parts of the parish from the school, are numerous, being
seldom under 30.  The quarterly fees are from 1 s. to 2 s.
6 d.-Of poor we have not a great number.  There have
not been, at any one time during my incumbency, above
15 or 16 on the roll.  At present there is only 10.  To
these the session makes a distribution quarterly.  The funds
arise from collections in the church, and the interest of a 
small sum of money.  We distribute at present, to the a-
mount of L. 2, 10 s. on quarter-day, beside supplying the
exigencies that occur during the quarter, which may make
about 10 s. more.  At an average, however, our distribu-
tions do not exceed 40 s. while our numbers are so few.
What has been now said of our poor, is to be understood
exclusively of Leadhills.  The poor of Leadhills, about 17
in number, are supported by the Earl of Hopetoun, and the
collections that are made in the chapel there.
