common rye-grass hay. The white clover, Trifolium repens, is
another of the natural grasses, which is peculiarly attached to the
soils of this district, and is reckoned one of the most valuable pas-
ture grasses which requires no cultivation. In the inferior, stiff
soils, which are unfriendly to healthy vegetation, the dock and
the common rush universally maintain their hold; but, as soon as
the ground is properly drained, and comes under cultivation, they
are no longer to be seen.
   The botany of this parish furnishes little that is peculiarly
interesting. Of the rarer plants found here, the following may
serve as an example; and the statement having been furnish-
ed by Robert Maughan, Esq. of Edinburgh, who is well known as
an eminent botanist, may be relied upon as correct.

   The plantations here consist chiefly of the common fir, larch,
spruce, the oak, the beech, the ash, and the elm. Almost all
those varieties seem adapted to the soil and climate, and in gene-
ral thrive well.  Near Calder House there are many fine limes
and beeches; but the tree that seems to have attained to the larg-
est size is a plane, which, from age, is now reduced to a mere
trunk. In the former Statistical Account of this parish, it is stat,-
ed that the trunk of this tree was 14 feet high, its circumference
at the thickest part, 18 feet, and that the branches extended at
least 30 feet on either side. On this tree are two large protube
rances, where it is said thejugs were formerly fixed. The age of
this plane cannot be exactly ascertained; but it is particularly
mentioned in our session records, December 1617, and as being
then of a very considerable size.
   The most extensive tract of woodland in this district, is Calder-
wood, the property of Lord Torphichen. It lies south-east of
Calder House, and is very beautifully situated between the Mu-
rieston and Linhouse Waters, the former of which is sometimes
