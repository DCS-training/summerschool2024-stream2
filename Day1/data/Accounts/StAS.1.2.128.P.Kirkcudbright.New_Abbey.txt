Wreaths at the foot of this hill.  The soil of Crissell is in gene-
ral good green pasture, especially on the N. and N. E.
sides.  It is visible at a great distance; and the country peo-
ple who live within sight of its summit are accustomed to con-
sult it as a sure weather-glass.

   State of Property.-Several people now living have seen the
whole parish, (one moderate estate excepted) in other families
than those of the present heritors; some estates have had three
different proprietors within the last 20 years, and 1/4 of the pa-
rish have changed owners in that period.  But this is not like-
ly often to be the case in time-coming; and one of the best
estates in the parish has been lately entailed.  The heritors
are 20 in number, but only one of any considerable property
resides.

   Mode of Cultivation.-In the lower division of the parish,
a mode of cultivating the ground, introduced, about 20 years
ago, by Mr Craik of Ardbigland, has been found by experience
to answer particularly well, especially when the land is inclos-
ed, and is as follows:  Each farm is divided into nine parts; one
division of the oldest ley in the farm, is the first year limed
with 50 or 60 Dumfries measures of unflacked lime, each mea-
sure costing 9 d. or 9 1/2 d. and containing about 2 1/8 Winchester
bushels:  thiss division is in spring ploughed up, and sown with
oats, at the rate of 8 or 9 Winchester bushels to the acre.
Nest year a second crop of oats is taken; the third crop must
be a green crop, or open fallow; the former may be pease
and beans, turnips, or potatoes, but the last is generally pre-
ferred, and they are planted in drills, from 3 to 3 1/2 feet asun-
der, and well dunged.  The fourth crop is barley or wheat,
with which 12 or 14 lb. of red clover, a Winchester bushels of
rye-grafs, and sometimes 6 lb. of white clover-seed, must be
