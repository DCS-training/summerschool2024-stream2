	                  V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Villages.-There are only two villages,-Ballater and Tullich.
Ballater, though of recent origin, is much frequented in summer
by strangers from a distance, on account of the salubrity of the air
and the beauty of its scenery.  Its streets or lanes cross the main
street at right angles.  Its houses are built on a regular plan, and
neatly fitted up for the accommodation of summer lodgers.  A
post-office is established in it, and it has the advantage of a daily
post to and from Aberdeen.
  Means of Communication.-There is an excellent commutation
road on the north side of the Dee to Charleston of Aboyne, where
it joins a turnpike road, 30 1/2 miles in length, leading to Aberdeen.
On this road, three weekly carriers travel between Ballater and
Aberdeen; but, at present, there is no public coach upon it, except
a mail-coach, which runs daily.  There is also a good commutation
road to Aberdeen on the south side of Dee, and several cross road
northward and southward, all kept in a proper state of repair.
   As to bridges, this parish has been very unfortunate.  Two ex-
cellent stone bridges, each consisting of five arches, have been
swept away by the Dee, within the space of thirty years.  The first
catastrophe was occasioned by an unusually high flood in the end
of August 1799 ; and the last by a still higher flood on the 4th
August 1829, of which some notice is taken by Sir Thomas Dick
Lauder in his account of the floods.  The second bridge, which
stood only twenty years, was erected near the ruins of the first in
1808-9; and the expense of it, between L.4000 and L.5000, was
