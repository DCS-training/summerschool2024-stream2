Blackhill and planted with firs,) stands near the head of
the supposed bridge, and from the remains of a fortification
on the top, seems to have been designed to cover the land-
ing-place.-The font or vessel used in administering baptism
in the church, is of a singular construction.  It is made of
brass, 16 1/4 inches in diameter.  On the interior surface are
impressed two circular lines of words; the outer circle con-
tains, in Roman characters, DI. DAL. WVNDI, five
times repeated; the inner circle consists of unknown cha-
racters, four times repeated, which cannot be represented
without an engraving An exact transcript of the whole
was made by me several years ago, and presented to the
Antiquarian Society of Scotland.

   General Characters and Condition of the People-The
people here have an indifference, and even dislike, both to a
seafaring and a military life.  They prefer the occupations
in husbandry or manufacture, to which they are inured
from their infancy.  They are rather fond of large wed-
dings and funerals, and often incur unnecessary expense on
such occasions.  Of late, they have become much more
studious of dress than they were, and have changed for
the better their mode of living in many articles of do-
mestic economy.  They are now more attentive to clean-
liness than formerly; their cottages are more substantially
and commodiously built; and their condition is daily im-
proving.  On the whole, they are sober, peaceable and in-
dustrious.  They are in general humane to one another and
show great kindness and sympathy to their distressed neigh-
bours.  During the last 30 years, one instance of suicide
has happened; and one person has been banished.  I have
not heard of any person belonging to the parish having
suffered capital punishment.

letter inverted.
