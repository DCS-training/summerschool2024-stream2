   134 				BANFFSHIRE.

   sy and irregular-tooking structure is situated a little to the east of
   the Aven, and about half-a-mile from its confluence with the Spey,
   upon low flat haugh of a triangular shape richly wooded, having
   a Cairnocay in the distance on the south, the Aven, clear as crystal,
   and lined with wood, on the west, the Spey hemmed in by moun-
   tains on the north, and on the east a magnificent bank (embracing
   Craig- Achrochean) covered with wood of many varieties, producing
   altogether a scene not often to be surpassed even in the Highlands.
   A little farther up the river, upon the edge of the high ground,
   and near a small stream called the Castle stripe, are to be seen the
   traces of a large building said to have been the old castle or man-
   sion-house of Ballindalloch, where tradition says it would have
   still stood, had not the rebuilding been prevented by unseen agency,
   -the part built in the day-time having been always thrown down
   through the night: at length a voice was heard saying, " build in the
   Cow Haugh, and you shall meet with no interruption." The re-
   commendation was followed, and the house of Ballindalloch conse-.
   quently raised in its present situation, where it has long stood un-
   assailed by the invisible adversary of its predecessor, but exposed
   by times to a real and little less formidable one, the Aven.  The
   most recent as well as the most destructive visit it received from
   this neighbour, happened at the great flood of 1829. *

<FOOTNOTE>To remedy the desolation occasioned at Ballindalloch by this flood, the aspect of
   which was truly appalling, appeared almost a hopeless task; nevertheless the attempt
   was made without delay, and with entire success, the place having some years ago as-
   sumed its wonted attractive appearance, and even become, in the opinion of many,
   prettier than before. Some old trees are indeed awanting, and a field or two may be
   deteriorated or circumscribed; still other trees have been planted, pits have been filled
   up, roots and stumps of trees and gravel cleared, the garden, which till then was close
   to the house, moved to a suitable distance, the lawn levelled, trenched, and laid out
   anew; and in addition to all this, and at an expense little less than that of all the other
   operations together, an embankment has been raised along the Aven, from its junction
   with the Spey to the rocks at the upper end of the lawn, a distance of about 1500
   yards, fiteed with stones keyed, that is, neatly set in after the end or edge to the level
   Of the field, and then raised three or four feet with earth, partly turfed, and partly
   made green by grass grown from the seed.  Great attention is bestowed, after goods,
   in examining this beautiful and substantial embankment, and in repairing breaches,
   which seldom, if ever, occur except by the failing of the river to a lower level.  For
   this purpose, baskets made of roi;gh planks or split trees nailed together in the shape
   of a parallelogram and filled with large stones, have been of great use. A Line of these
   baskets or creels, as they are called, has been found more effectual in opposing the
   river than any other obstacle hitherto employed; and by their aid, the embankment
   has without the smallest apparent diminution of its strength or neatness, been under-
   founded for a long way, part of it to the depth of nearly six feet, so as to suit the bed
   of the river, which is deepened here and there by almost every flood.
