property of the Honourable Admiral Fleeming, between Castle-
cairey and the Barr-hill, and also in this parish. It is sometimes
of considerable depth, and twenty or thirty yards broad, I
with a thick coating of verdure. The bottom of it is everywhere
pervaded with masses or rather fragments of broken stones. It
is here uniformly called Graeme's Dike.

                       III.-POPULATION.
    In 1751, the Rev. Dr Erskine, at that. time minister of Kirkin-
tilloch, afterwards of Edinburgh, found the population to be as
follows:

<TABLE>
		Families in the town,				195
         		in the country,				226
		Persons in the town above eight years of age,	575
                           in the country,     do.       do.            796

   The addition of the Seceders and Quakers, at that time in the
parish, made up 1400 examinable persons, which, being taken at
one-half of the population, will give 2800 of a population. This
is Mr Dunn's data, deducible from Dr Erskine's returns, but it is
erroneous. Dr Erskine gives the total families in town and coun-
try at 421 ; and if we allow four to a family, which is a fair enough
calculation for those times ive a total population of 1664.
The return of souls to Dr Webster in 1755 was 1696, so that
the total increase in four years was onty 32 souls. The number
of inhabitants in the parish in 1791 was as follows:

<TABLE>
			In the town,	1536
			In the country,	1103
                                             ____
				Total,	2639

	This shows an increase in forty years of 943.

<TABLE>
		Population in 1801,	3210
                                1811,        3740
                                1821,        4580
                                1828,        5518
                                1831,        5888

   The increase in ten years, from 1791 to 1801, is 570; from
1801 to 1811, the next ten years, 530 ; from this last period till
1821, it is 840 ; 938 for seven years, from 1821 to 1828; and for
three years from 1828 to 1831, the increase was 370; so that in
the ten years before 1831 the total increase was 1308. The gross
average annual increase for the whole period is rather more than
81 per annum. The full particulars of the census of 1828 are in
the hands of Mr John Moffat, merchant in Kirkintilloch. The
following are its general results.
