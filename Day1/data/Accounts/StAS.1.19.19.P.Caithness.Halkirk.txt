any other country.
   As to mines, the surface of the ground, the colour of the

banks, the essays and attempts that have been made for

brown stone, in great abundance, on the surface of the earth,
which I am apt to conclude may be iron ore, but whether
good or bad of its kind I cannot say.  This depends on

in their expectations, for the weather immediately after-
wards became more cold and stormy.  They are consider-
ably more frequent and loud of late years.  Earthquakes,
