     Statistical Account

   Opposite the village of Largs, the water is several fathoms
deep almost at the very Chore.  The inhabitants have gene-
rally a taste for the sea; and many of them have moneys
which might be employed to good purpose in trade.
   All circumstances contribute to render Largs proper for a
sea-port town.  The only obstacles are, the want of a har-
bour, and good roads through the country, to facilitate the
conveyance of goods by land.  Were these to be removed,
some kind of manufacture to be established, and an act of
Parliament procured for the roads, levying harbour dues, etc.
the numbers and wealth of the inhabitants would at once be
increased; and this would operate as a stimulus to the im-
provement of the soil.  A place possessing so many beauties
and natural advantages, with the addition of trade and ma-
nufactures would have inducements not only to retain the
number of inhabitants, but to allure others to settle there.
If the parish, however, has not the advantage of more opu-
lent districts, in trade, manufactures, and commerce, it is en-
tirely free of the vices which luxury introduces; and, in this
troublesome and distracted period, the inhabitants, with the
exception of a few individuals, may be truly said both to
fear God and honour their King.
