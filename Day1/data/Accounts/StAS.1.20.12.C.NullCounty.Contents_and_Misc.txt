xii   History of the Origin and Progress of the

stances of the Country; but, after taking every 
possible pains to become master of the subject, all 
the information I could obtain, was so extremely 
defective, that it was necessary to give up the idea; 
which I did with a considerable degree of reluc-
tance.
  On my arrival at Edinburgh, in May 1790, to 
attend the General Assembly of the Church of Scot-
land, of which Assembly I was a Lay Member, 
and with the leaders of which, I lived on terms of 
intimacy and friendship, it fortunately occurred 
to me, that I might prevail upon that respectable 
body, to furnish such information, respecting the 
general state of Scotland, as might enable me to 
give a sufficient idea of the political situation of 
that part of the British empire.  My original in-
tention was, to have drawn up a General Statisti-
cal View of North Britain, without any particular 
reference to parochial districts; but I found such 
merit and ability, and so many useful facts and im-
portant observations, in the communications which 
were sent me, that I could not think of depriving 
the Clergy, of the credit they were entitled to de-
rive, from such laborious exertions, and thence was 
induced, to give the Work to the Public, in the 
manner in which it has been printed.  It is my 
intention, at the same time, as soon as leisure from 
other pursuits will admit it, to draw up the result 
of the whole inquiry, in a publication to be enti-
tled, "Analysis of the Political State of Scotland,
                                              "with
