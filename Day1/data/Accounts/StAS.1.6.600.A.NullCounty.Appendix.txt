   A second iron pipe of 7 inches diameter was laid in 1790; and
additional springs 3 miles farther south than the former were
taken in.-These pipes have cost the city of Edinburgh an im-
mense sum of money, the last one having cost above L. 20,000.
The reservoir on the Castle-hill contains about 300 tons, and
the new one at Heriot's hospital contains nearly the same quan-
tity.  Edinburgh is amply supplied with as fine spring water
as any in Europe, and Leith now partakes of the same advan-
tage.  On the 10th of May 1782, after 3 weeks of drought,
these springs at the fountain head, yielded 1060 Scots pints
(or 4240 English) per minute, or 3000 tons in 24 hours.-
After supplying all the inhabitants, a large stream of lim-
pid water runs down the streets for many hours day and night.
The like is not to be equalled, it is believed in Europe, except
at Bern in Switzerland*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The increase of inhabitants may, in some measure, be judged of from the
above circumstance:  Before the above period they must have been supplied
with water from pit wells, of which great numbers were on the south of the
Cowgate-street.  The increase of inhabitants also appears from a list of fami-
lies taken Anno 1687, in the six parishes of which the Old Town of Edinburgh
then consisted.  The number was as follows:

   At an average of six to each family, the number of inhabitants would have
been at that time 19,998, within the walls of the city.-Like London, the
suburbs are now more extensive than the city.
