   The castle and adjoining grounds hold of the Crown
blench, and pay neither cess, stipend, nor any burden what-

of Auchmedden, to the Earl of Findlater, who enjoyed the

   Part of the ancient wall is yet entire; and the remains of
the most and intrenchments are still viable.
   Excepting a small adjoining house, the residence of Arch-
bishop Sharp's father, the castle is now a plain modern
building*.  Its situation is uncommonly pleasing and ro-
mantic, an few dwellings can boast of a greater variety of 
charming prospects.

hand.  He is represented sitting in his painting chamber, 
with his hat on, and his pallet before him.  On the walls
of his room seem carelessly to be hung several productions
of his various pencil.
   Near to the castle was situated the chaplainry of the
Holy Rood, or Sancti Crucis, consecrated in commemoration
of our Saviour's sufferings.  At what period, or by what
founder, this chapel was erected, no information can be de-
rived, either from tradition or ancient record.  From an old
register of the town-council, 1544, we learn, that this reli-
gious house lay within the liberties of the burgh, and com-

manners, and unwearied benevolence, which adorned her character,

     She had, indeed,
     a tear for pity, and a hand
     Open as day to melting charity.
