owing to several causes.  When people of small landed pro-
perty no longer lived upon the produce of their estates, but
followed the example of their wealthier neighbours, in the
use of foreign commodities,they contracted debt, sold their
estates, and went to push their fortunes elsewhere.  when
the jurisdiction act took place, and men of landed property
could not make their tenants fight their battles, they became
less careful of having clever fellows about them, and so began
to consider, how they might make most of the class of
men in another way.  Then the rents began to be raised, the
farms to be enlarged, much land to be taken into the land-
lord's domain, and the shephered and his dog to be the inhabi-
tants of farms, that formerly maintained many families;
though this last particular is not, as yet, so much the cafe
here, as it is in many other place.  In consequence of these
changes, some of the tenants are become cottagers; some have
removed to towns, to gain a livelihood by labour; and a few
have emigrated to America, though the spirit is not become
very common here as yet.  The return to Dr Webster, how-
ever, being only 3257 fouls, the decrease has been inconside-
rable.

   Number of Proprietors.-There are at present only eleven he-
ritors, one of whom (the Duke of Athol) possesses at least one
half of the parish.  Five of there, either occassionally, or con-
stantly, reside in it.

   Tenants.-The tenants, who hold from a half to a whole
merk land, have been reckoned about 240, paying from L. 5
to L.10 rent; and those who pay from L. 10 to L. 70 only 20.
Tradesman (mechanics,) labourers, and cottagers, who have
pendicles, may amount to 85, paying from 15 s to L. 2 per
acre.  Only one tenant has a very large tract of arable ground.
