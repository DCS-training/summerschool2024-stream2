by the manufacturers in Huntly, in different towns, and in
the country around.-There is also a cotton manufactory esta-
blished in this place, but it is yet in an infant state.  There
are about 32 wrights, including wheel and cart-wrights.
There are also masons, blacksmiths, tailors, etc. in propor-
tion.

   Church, etc.-The church, when first erected, might have
been perhaps large enough, to contain more than, at that time,
attended the Established worship, but it cannot now hold
above 3 fourths of the parish, though 3 galleries have been
of late erected.  One of these is directly fronting the pulpit,
which, from the narrowness of the church, proves a very
great incumbrance to the speaker's voice, and equally so to
many of the hearers.  The other 2 galleries were erected at
the expence of the session, and the rent of the seats annually
paid for the use of the poor.  If there had been a church
erected here, equal to the number of inhabitants, and suited
to the high rank of the patron, it would have prevented many
dissenters and sectaries, and, what is of greater consequence,
would have contributed to a more religious observation of the
Sabbath; as many, who cannot find room in the church, either
go to other places of worship, stay at home, or stroll in the
fields.-There are other 3 places of public worship, 1 of the Se-
cession (Antiburgher), 1 of the Church of England, and 1 of
Roman Catholica; but the numbers attending these are not
increasing.  The pastors of each, however, live in mutual
friendship and Christian charity.  There is no manse proper-

such a distance from the town, that the present incumbent
finds it more profitable, to let it in lease from year to year,
than to cultivate it.  It consists of 10 acres of ground, of va-
rious qualities, partly of a hard, dry, and sandy soil, and
