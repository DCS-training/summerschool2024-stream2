purposely excluded from this scheme.  Not that I am so un-
grateful as to disparage a study, to which I am proud to
confess my obligations, as the dulce lenimen laborum, and the
source of the most delicious pleasures.  On the contrary, I
would propose that distinct academies should be established,
at convenient distances, for this branch of education alone
where it might be taught with more ease, and on a better
plan, than is commonly the case in our schools.  My only
reason for discarding it from the general, course, is, that the
time allotted would be insufficient for both purposes.  Those,
who can afford to send their sons to school for a considerable

practice of half the parents in Scotland, who compel their
children to acquire even the knowledge of orthography and
syntax, through the medium of an apprenticeship for two or

   From such an institution as the foregoing, properly con-
ducted, what salutary, what glorious consequences might we
not expect?  What an increase of curiosity, of activity, of
information, of wisdom, of probity, of liberal sentiment, and
of rational enjoyment?  The progression of ages would be
attended with an accelerated progression of virtue; and the
