   The total cost of erecting a heating apparatus is estimated at
about L.190, 16s. for each blast furnace, thus:-Brick work,
L.20; iron work for, furnace, L.12; cast iron pipes, L.33, 8s.

                      V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Nearly the whole population, with the exception of those con-
nected with rural operations, and 4 few weavers and other neces-
sary tradesmen, are absorbed in the coal and iron trade.  There
is no great town in the parish, but many of the villages are in-
creasing daily, and, indeed, the centre of the parish, about Long-
lone and Coatbridge, is one large village.  In 1794, the number
of, colliers, bearers, and others connected with that business in
the parish was at Fullarton, 150; Barrachnie, &c. 75; Mr Stir-
ling's 160; Captain Christie's, 50; total, 435.  At present the
number employed is about 3000.
   Market Town, &c.-The nearest market-town is Airdrie, in New
Monkland, on the immediate confines of the parish.  The com-
munications in all directions by roads, railways, and the canal, are
such as might be expected in a great commercial dirtrict.  There are
in the parish forty-four miles of roads, and ten miles of turnpike.
About L.500 per annum is raised for road-money, but in some places,
from the great increase of carting from the collieries to the canal and
railways, the parish roads are very bad.  Four great railways pass
through this parish, or enter into it by immediate junctions or con-
nections, viz. the Monkland and Kirkintilloch, the Ballochnie, the
Garnkirk and Glasgow, and Wishaw and Coltness.  Besides these,
the Monkland and Glasgow Canal extends through almost the entire
length of the parish.  The revenue of the canal may be L.15,000
per annum, and that of the railways L.20,000.  Twenty years ago,
track-boat was put upon the canal about that time.  The Gara-
kirk Railway Company run a train of carriages by steam four times
a day between Glasgow and Airdie; open carriages, 8d., close
