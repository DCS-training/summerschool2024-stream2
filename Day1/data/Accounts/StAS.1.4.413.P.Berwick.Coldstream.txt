     of Coldstream.

   Newcastle, employed in that business, engaged lately to
make the experiment on a great scale, and for that end en-
tered into terms with Lord Binning.  The writs were ex-
tended, an agent from his Lordship came to Coldstream to
finish and settle the affair; but these colliers of the south
broke their faith with him, and disappointed our hopes.-
shell-marl was found in one marsh, and there are plenty of
rock-marl in many parts.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's return, about 40
years ago, the numbers were 1493.  From the roll of ex
aminable persons in 1785 and 1786, the numbers were
2017.  In the country part of the parish, were 292 males,
387 females and 176 children.  In the town and a few houses
adjacent to it, the numbers were 1162.  Number of fami-
lies in the town, 305; in the country 189.  I must remark,
however, that the examination-roll is by no means a stan-
dard by which the number of inhabitants of a parish is
to be estimated.  This roll is usually made up by the officer
of the session, called the kirk-officer, who is seldom a per-
son in whom any trust in a matter of this investigation can
be reposed. The age at which children are to be inrolled
is not ascertained.  Parents, according as they have been
anxious to forward, or have been negligent in their educa-
tion, are desirous to have the names of their children early
inserted in or withheld from this parochial record.  Still,
however, it gives a general prospectus of the population of
a parish,  I must add, that the session-officer in this parish
is one of the few to be depended upon for accuracy.
