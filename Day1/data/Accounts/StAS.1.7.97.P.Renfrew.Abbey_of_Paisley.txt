measure the more reasonable and necessary in this parish,
as among the many affluent landholders belonging to it, on-
ly one or two who resided within the parish, did ever con-
tribute any thing for the maintainance of the poor.  The
first assessment was 152 l. from which sum it soon rose to
415 l.; but this, like other taxes, is not completely effective.
It has stood at that sum for the last three years; and if the
attention that has hitherto been given to the management be
continued, and the same care taken to admit no improper
objects on charity, it is hoped there will be no necessity, for
some time, to impose a greater.  The collections amount to
about 80 l. yearly.; the dues of proclamation 18 l.; mort-
cloths, 11 l.; and the interests of money, with a trifling sum
arising from fines imposed by the kirk session, about 15 l.
The produce of the whole funds is thrown into one sum, and
distributed by the kirk session, and 21 overseers, chosen
equally from the heritors, farmers, and householders.  A
small salary is paid for collecting the assessment, and paying

ment.  The mode of assessment and distribution is so similar
to that in the parish of Jedburgh, that the minute diffe-
rences are not worth noticing.
   Besides there parochial funds for the relief of the poor,
there is a considerable subscription yearly to the Paisley Dis-
pensary, an institution that has subsisted since 1786, and
been attended with very happy effects among the lower
classes of the industrious inhabitants of this place.  The
yearly amount of the subscription to that charity, from the
town and suburbs, has been about 130 l.
   Various societies are formed among the journeymen wea-
vers, for the relief of those members who, by age or sick-
ness, are incapacitated for work.  Sunday schools, though
upon a small scale, have been lately established, both in the
