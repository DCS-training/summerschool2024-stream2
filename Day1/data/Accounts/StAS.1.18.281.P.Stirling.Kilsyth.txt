   Produce, etc.-The produce of the arable lands consists
principally in oats, though partly in barley, potatoes, beans,
rye grass, and hay. It is difficult to say, what proportion of acres
there may be in each kind; there are not 2 acres in fallow,
nor 3 in wheat and turnip, in the whole parish.  But the
following will be found to be a general estimate of the
produce.

   Our oats yield from 12 to 16 pecks of meal in the boll.
And it is universally understood, that a warm summer makes
the crop yield well, and vice versa, though the fodder be
plenty.
   The table is not taken from an accurate measurement: but
the produce per acre may be depended on. It is but seldom
that the average rises above it, though in some fields it is e-
qual to the last column.
   Rye is seldom sown, at least in any quantity.  I have never
seen above an acre in one field: but the little that is raised,
is uncommonly good.  Wheat has been attempted, but we have
not acquired the art of cultivating that precious grain to ad-
vantage: though our rich valley is peculiarly adapted to the
