     NUMBER XXXI.

     PARISH OF LESLY.

     (Presbytery of Garioch-County and Synod of Aberdeen.)

     By the Rev. Mr. J. HARPER, Assistant to the Rev. Mr. ALEX.
     STEWART, Minister of that Parish,

     Origin of the Name.

   THE ancient and modern name of the parish is Lesly;
the etymology of which is uncertain.  There is a tra-
dition, that one Bartholemew de Leslyn, a noble Hungarian,
came to Scotland with Queen Margaret, about the year 1067;
that he was a son of Walter de Leslyn, who had taken his
sirname from the castle of Leslyn in Hungary, where he was
born; and that he, or some of his descendants, having ob-
tained a grant of certain lands in Garioch, called them by his
own name.  It is certain, that the family of Rothes were
long proprietors of a considerable part of the parish of Leslie*,
and other lands in Garioch, and it is not improbable that
the parish derives its appellation from them. A charter was
granted by James II. to George, designed Dominus de Lesly,

<FOOTNOTE>

*At that period, Lord Glammiss was proprietor of the other part of the parish.
