Climate and Diseases.-The higher ground possesses, from
its elevated situation, a pure and wholesome air, though ra-
ther keen and piercing; but the lower part of the parish
cannot boast of so pure an atmosphere, for it is often loaded
with moist vapours, the common exhalations of deep and nar
row vallies, where flow rivers wind their course, and where
much of the surface is covered during winter with stagnated
water.  The existence of agues, sluxes, rheumatism, and o-
ther kindred disorders of the human frame, is the natural
consequence of such a stare of atmosphere.  It cannot, how-
ever, be faid, that the inhabitants, tho' occasionally attacked
by there disorders, are in general unhealthy.  Nature and ha-
bit have a wonderful power to form the constitution to its
local residence and destination in life.  Agnes, formerly of a
severe and redious kind, were very prevailing; the returns
of spring and autumn never failed to bring along with
them this fatal disease, and frequently laid aside many of
the labouring hands, at a time when their work was of the
greatest consequence and necessity.  For several years, how-
ever, this disease, so enseebling to the human system, has
in a great measure ceased.  This happy change may be
owing in part to a different mode of living, and in part,
probably, to the better and more general cultivation of the
soil, considered as a fource of more pure and wholesome
air.  In this neigbourhood, large tracts of moorish ground,
which lay totally neglected, and covered with water in
winter and spring, have lately been broken up, drained,
and brough under tillage, or planted with timber, which
absorbs and exhausts the superflous moisture.  Consump-
tions are rather more frequent than formerly among the
young, and often feemingly healthy and vigorous.  They
are no doubt sometimes owing to a radical weakness of
constitution, but more frequently to sedentary occupations,
damp houses, crowding the sick and the healthy together
