greater interest and value to his painting as a record of the times.
It is considered equal in merit to some of the more recent and
most admired productions of his pencil.
  Eminent Men.--Among the eminent characters connected with this
parish, is the distinguished courtier Sir James Melville, who figured
during the reign of Mary Queen of Scots, and who, according to
his own relation, performed so many feats of dexterous diplomacy
between the rival queens of Scotland and England.  He was proprie-
tor of the estate of Hall-hill. This property, it appears originally
belonged to Henry Balnaves, who, in 1542, was Duputy-Keeper of
the Privy-Seal, and the following year, Secreatary-Depute. The
lands of Hall-hill were by him disposed of to Sir James Melville,
who was third son to Sir John Melville of Raith, one of the early
promotes of the Reformed faith. The property continued in his
family till the reign of Charles IL, when it was purchased by the
Earl of Melville. No trace of the house now remains, and the
ground where it stood forms part of the present enclousures of
Melville. 
  The celebrated Dr Hugh Blair commenced his ministry in this
parish, to the pastoral charge of which he was ordained on the 23d
September in the year 1742. I have in my possession a list of
the names of the ministers of the parish as far back as 1578. There
have been fifteen ministers since that year, previous to the present
incumbent, of whom it appears that four were removed to other
charges. One, Mr John Ogilvie, was ejected during the attempt to
establish Episcopacy in Scotland before the Revolution of 1688;
and the rest seem to have died in the parish.
  Antiquities.--There are several antiquities in the parish as to
