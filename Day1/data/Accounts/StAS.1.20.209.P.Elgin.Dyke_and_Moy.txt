rel, of 4 cwt. formerly sold for L. 4, and sometimes for L. 5,
now it fetches only 50 s.

   Cod.-Cod are sometimes caught in great abundance, by
Nairn and Findern boats, in the beginning of winter, when
the weather cannot serve for drying them.  An adventurer,
from this parish, cured a quantity in barrels, like salted sal-
mon, carried them to London, and made no loss by the ad-
venture, though they sold heavily, and must have been but
unpleasant food.  But had these cod been parboiled, and cu-
red with vinegar at the boil-house, like ketled salmon, it is
believed, such soused fish would have excellent the salted, as
much as the kitted salmon exceeds the salted, in quality and
price.

   Seals.-There are also sea-calves or seals on the coast of
this parish, whereof one man has killed 130 in a year,
worth 4 s. apiece, for their oil and skin.  The matter of
seal-fishing is the more deserving of attention, because, be-
side the intrinsic value of seals, they lie in wait for salmon,
and frighten them away from a shallow coast.

   Yarn.-The yarn-trade has fallen off greatly since the
use of cottons hath become almost universal.  There are yet
3 yarn factors int he parish, who buy up yarn spun from
home flax, and give out foreign flax to be spun, from 2 1/2 d.
to 3 1/2 d. per hank.  They were in use to expend about
L. 500 a-year for the spinning and purchase of yarn; now
they do not exceed L. 300 in whole.  From the number of
weavers in the parish, I suppose the high prices for coarse
cloth makes the spinners manufacture their own lint for the
fairs.  From 20 cuts to 2 1/2 hanks is the common grift of
spinning here.
