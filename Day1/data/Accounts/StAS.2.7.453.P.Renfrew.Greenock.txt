 Thomas Grainger, and J.U. Rastrick, Esqs. civil-engineers.
 The whole length is 22 miles, 4 1/2 furlongs. The intermediate
 stations for the first-class trains are Port-Glasgow and Paisley.
   The grounds on which the projectors rest their expectations of
success are the following:-
  First, It is computed that the greater rapidity of railway tra-
velling, and its certainty as to time, will induce a great many pas-
sengers who now travel by water between Glasgow and Greenock
to go by land. In the estimate of their probable revenue from
this source, the railway directors make the computation, that one-
half will prefer the latter mode of conveyance. Of the passengers
between Glasgow and places beyond Greenock, they compute that
one-third will go by the railway. Of the cabin-passengers between
Glasgow and Paisley by the canal, it is computed that one-half
will go by railway; and of the steerage passengers by the canal,
one-tenth. It is assumed that the number of travellers will be in-
creased by the opening of the railway. Taking them at a small
average, the number is doubled as the probable increase.
  Secondly, The proportion of goods assumed to be carried by
the railway, is taken in a similar manner. The total quantity of
goods carried between the above towns being about 352,650 tons,
144,600 tons are computed to be sent by railway.
  Passengers will be carried between Glasgow and Greenock at

an average charge of not more than 2s., and from Paisley to
Greenock, at an average charge of ls. 3d. Goods will be carried
from Glasgow to Greenock at 4s. per ton; the river charge being
at present, on an average, about 6s. 6d., and from Glasgow to
Paisley for 2s. 6d., the canal charge being on an average about 7s.
  The following table, taken from a prospectus published by the
directors of the railway, whows the amount of income expected
from the sources which have now been mentioned:

                                    21,918  8 0    One-fourth nearly.
Goods.
  the expense of the construction of the railway is considerably
under L. 18,000 per mile, but including stations, engines, car-
riages, &c. L. 22,000. After making ample allowance for keep-
ing the railway and works in repari, the directors anticipate from
the sources which have mentioned, a clear dividend of 12
per cent.
