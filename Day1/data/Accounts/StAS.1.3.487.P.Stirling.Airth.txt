     of Airth.

   Soil.-The soil is, in general, a strong deep clay, but the
Hill of Airth is a very rich mould.  It is believed, a great part
of the low ground, near the river, once made part of its bed,
as many sea shells are mingled with the earth; and a few
years ago, an anchor was found upon Dunmore hill, by
the Earl of Dunmore, about half a mile from the present
course of the river, when digging  a few feet below the sur-
face.  At a small distance from the same place, there is a
large stone, called Carling Stone, to which the cables of ships
are supposed to have been fastened, and of which there are
still evedent marks.  On the west side of the parish, there
are part of two mosses, called the Mosses of Dunmore and
Letham.  Within these 25 years, 100 acres of ground have
been gained from that part of the Moss of Dunmore which
belongs to the Earl, and added to the arable land.  Here
are settled 30 families, called Moss Lairds, as the ground
is given them for a certain number of years, at a very low
rent, in recompence for their labour in clearing away the
moss.  The settlres are industrious and healthy.  The moss
is from 5 to 10 feet deep, and when removed, the soil under
it is not inferior to that of the neighbouring Carse.

   Climate, etc.-The air is pretty dry, and free from fogs;
and, though mists are frequently seen on the distant hills
and high grounds, yet they are seldom experienced here.
The people, in general, are healthy and laborious.  The sea
breezes, doubtless, contribute to the health of the inhabi-
tants on the river side.  Though the people in the Carse are
said to be much subject to the ague, of late years instances
of that disease have been few.

   Rivers and Fish.-There is a small river, which runs
through the parish, from west to east; it takes its rise in St.
