     Statistical Account

50 l. by a late Dr George Reid.  The collections in the
church are between 5 s. and 6 s. Sterling each Lord's day,
and about 5 l. or 6 l. Sterling on communion occasions. The
poor are supplied at several annual distributions, and as they
are found to stand in need.  The average of marriages, for
the last 30 years, is 13; of baptisms, 29. No register for
burials.

   Character.-The people in general are industrious, sober,
and peaceable.  There has been no criminal prosecution of
any inhabitant for a long time past.  Whether, within the
last 30 or 40 years, the people have improved in morals, and
the ornaments of the mind, shall not be positively affirmed;
perhaps there is no great difference; but in external attire,
there is a striking alteration to the better, especially among
the young men and women.  None are of the Popish persua-
sion; 3 are of the English Episcopal church; and about 30
Seceders, of the Antiburgher persuasion.  These last obtain-
ed liberty more than 20 years ago, from one of the heritors,
to build a meeting-house.  They have another in the parish
of Echt, but no settled clergyman in either parish.-The spi-
rit of secession has been, and is declining in this district.
