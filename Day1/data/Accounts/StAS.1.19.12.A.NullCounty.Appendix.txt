long as they did not differ with the persons who had assum-

the burgh, viz. the Provost (for many years styled Alder-
man) and the four Bailies, were alone elected annually at
head-courts of the citizens, called Curiae Capitales, although
sometimes without mentioning by whom the election even
of these officers was made, but for the most part expressed

   It appears, however, that Mr Cheyne, and his associates,
did not get into power upon the new constitution, which
they had the merit to produce; and that, at the ensuing
