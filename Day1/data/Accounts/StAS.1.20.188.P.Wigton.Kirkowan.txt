part is moor.  The soil of the arable land, in the north-
west end of the parish, is cold and thin, and produces little
other kind of grain than black oats.  The arable land, in the
south-east end of the parish, is of a better quality, and bears
a greater proportion to the pasture land than in the other
end.  In general, it is a light, dry, stoney soil, which, after
lime or dung, yields excellent crops of oats or barley.  Lime
has been but very lately introduced here as a manure; but
since the improvement of our roads, very considerable quan-
tities of it have been used in this way.  It is brought to us,
in the state of shells, from Whitehaven, and drawn to the
land mostly in single-horse carts.  Some of the farmers have
to carry it to the distance of 10 or 12 miles; and the small-
est distance of any of them to a sea-port is not less than 6.
The grain raised in the parish is considerably more than suf-
ficent to supply the inhabitants.

   Cattle.-The horse and cattle bred in this district, require
no particular description, as they are well known over a 
great part of the island by the name of Galloways, and are
allowed every where to be excellent of their kind.  The
number of horses in the parish is about 200; the black-
cattle amount to about 1600; and the sheep to near
10,000.  Wedders of 3 and 4 years old, weigh from 38 to
42 libs.  Our wool is of different qualities; but that which
is got from the sheep which feed upon the fells is reckoned
the finest.  There are several of these fells in this parish;
but none of them deserves a particular description.  It is
probable,  however, that one of them, upon the Carrick
march, has a greater elevation above the level of the sea
than any other land in this county.

   Rent.-An account of the rent of this parish was given in
to the Court of Teinds about 36 years ago, when the sum so
