<TABLE=III.--POPULATION.>
The population in 1758, according to Dr Webster's return, was	1498
		  1793, Statistical Account,   			      2000
              1801, Parliamentary census,			            2321
		  1811,						            2815
		  1821,		          				      3313
  		  1831, males, 1833--females, 1906, 	            3739
		  1835, December. males, 1907--famales, 1934,         3841

The small increase of the population since 1831 may be ac-
counted for partly by the ravages of cholera, and also from the
small number of houses that have been built of late years. Many
families have been obliged to leave the parish in consequence of
their inability to procure houses.

	It is believed that this is nearly correct. Every child baptised
in the Established Church must be registered previously. There
are only two instances in the last seven years of persons not be-
longing to the Established Church registering the births of their
children. A register is kept by the United Secession congrega-
tion, but, owing to the neglect of parents in registering their child-
ren, its accuracy cannot be depended on. The average number
of marriages is 32. It has been impossible to ascertain the num-
ber of deaths, no register being kept.
