author of a considerable number of pamphlets and theological tracts,
and died at Edinburgh in 1736.  Mr John Pinkerton, the well-known
historian, critic, and antiquary, was descended from a family, who at
one time resided at Dalserf, though they afterwards removed to the
neighbourbood of Edinburgh.  Several of his connexions and re-
lations live in the vicinity, and claim the privilege of burying in the
churchyard.

                             III.-POPULATION.
   No account of the population in ancient times is known to exist.
Beginning with the return made to Dr Webster in 1755, the fol-
lowing statement will rhow the amount of population at each census
subsequently taken by direction of Parliament, and the increase
during the several intervals.

        Total increase in 76 years,      1924

   By the census of 1831, the number of males was 1337, and of
females, 1343, = 2680.  In order to meet the inquiries of the
General Assembly and the Religious Instruction Commissioners,
with regard to church accommodation, a careful census of the po-
pulation was taken in 1835.  The return was 2874 souls, sbewing
an increase in eighty years of 2118.  The population now (I840)
must be considerably upwards of 3000.  The increase is entirely
in the villages, and especially in Larkhall and neighbourhood.
The agricultural and rural population is rather decreasing, from
enlargement of farms, and improved habits of husbandry.  Houses
for country cottars will soon disappear.  There is even a scarcity
of country tradesmen and artisans, living among and supplying the
wants of their farming and labouring neighbours.  The villages
are in course of rapidly absorbing the whole popul`tion, except
farmers and their servants.  For the large increase of the manu-
facturing and village population of late years, several reasons may
be assigned.  The Larkhall district has a salubrious air, good
water, and abundance of fuel and freestone.  It is near the town
of Hamilton, intersected by the great road from Glasgow to Car-
lisle, and enjoys means of ready communication with the whole
surrounding country.  Ground for feuing is obtained easily, and
on terms.  Of this facility, advantage has been taken by
building societies, (elsewhere referred to and explained), which
