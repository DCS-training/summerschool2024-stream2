           I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.--CUMBERNAULD, in Celtic Cumar-an-alt, is said to sig-
nify the meeting of streams, descriptive enough of the situation of this
parish,-several brooks uniting their streams a little below the vil-
lage of Cumbernauld. As it originally formed part of the ancient king-
dom of Cumbria, comprehending the south and south-west of Scot-
land, as well as Cumberland in England, it is supposed by some
to have derived its name from the Cumbrians. Nothing, however,
is more involved in mystery, than the derivation of names, and this,

   Extent, &c.--The parish of Cumbernauld, situated at the east-

Stirling. From east to west its length is about 8 miles, and its
breadth from north to south from 3 to 4 miles.
   Geology.--This parish is formed of a succession of ridges of
whinstone or trap, running in parallel lines to each other, in a di-

or paving streets, and for building fitrm-houses and fences, is here
in great abundance. Freestone also abounds in various parts of
the parish of excellent quality, and for the purpose of building is
worked to a very considerable extent in the lands of Netherwood,
adjoining the Forth and Clyde Canal. Limestone on the same
lands, and also at Cumbernauld, of a very superior quality, is work-
ed to a great extent, the former averaging above L.4000, and the
latter L.2500 annually. The mine of Netherwood at present is
