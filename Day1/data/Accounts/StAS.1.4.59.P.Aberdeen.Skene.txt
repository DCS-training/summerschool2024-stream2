villages in the parish.  The annual average of births from
1740 to 1750, was 39; from 1760 to 1770, 30 from
1780 to 1790, 19.  The annual average of deaths from
1760 to 1770, 30; from 1780 to 1790, 25.  The annual
average of marriages from 1760 to 1770, 15; from 1780
to 1790, 9.  The rule for ascertaining the population of
any parish or district, (viz. by multiplying the number of
births by 26, and the number of deaths by 36), does not
appear to be at all accurates; nor has it nearly answered in
any instance that I have heard of, where it has been tried.
The number of souls under 10 years of age, amounts to
235; from 10 to 20, is 274; from 20 to 50, is 460; from
50 to 70, is 158; above 70, and below 100, is 106.  There
were formerly 51 farms, or rather ploughs, in the parish.
The number is now diminished.  A farmer's family, at an
average, may consist of from 6 to 9 persons.  There are 2
or 3 merchants, and 14 or 15 tradesmen.  A very consi-
derable proportion of the present inhabitants of the parish
are natives of other parishes.  The whole parish is of the
Established Church, except 1 Seceder, and 9 Roman Catho-
lics.  The proportion of the annual births to the whole popu-
lation is nearly as 1 to 65; of the annual mariages to the
whole population a; 1 to 137; of the annual deaths to the
whole population nearly as 1 to 49.  At an average,
each marriage may be said to produce from 4 to 6 child-
ren.

   Productions Agriculture, etc.-On the lands belonging to
Skene only have trees been hitherto raised.  No plantations
have till of late been made, and even that to no great extent,
nor improvements indeed of any kind, owing to invincible
obstructions.  Considering the great quantity of waste land
in the parish, fit only for bearing trees, the neglect of culti-
vating them is much to be regretted.  Trees of all kinds
