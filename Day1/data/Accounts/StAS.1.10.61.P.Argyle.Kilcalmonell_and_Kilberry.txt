of farming, by subdividing, draining, using the best utensils,
and introducing green crops and sown grasses.  It is unfor-
tunate, however, that he has not fixed upon a better soil for
his operations.  All Lord Stonefield's tenants, indeed, sow
turnips, a crop peculiarly adapted to the climate of this
country.  But, until they have small and sufficient inclosures,
at his Lordship's expence, (neither their own purses nor leases
being able to afford them), it is not to be expected that the
turnip crops can succeed.  It is but justice, however, to the
memory of the late Stonefield, sheriff of the county, (whose
patriotism and abilities, in promoting the Argyllshire roads,
will be long remembered), to observe, that more has been
done for the improvement of this estate, by large inclosures,
draining, and planting, than in all the rest of the parish put
together.
   The minister of this parish practices an improved method
of planting potatoes, which, from accurate and repeated ex-
periments in soil not superior to the average of Great Bri-
tain, will, on a moderate computation, yield 24 s. per acre
more than the method recommended by the most approved
writers on farming.  He has with success applied peat dust,
and roots of kail and cabbage, as manure to the potatoes;
and he has contrived a harrow for the purposes of the horse-
hoeing husbandry, by which the surface can be smoothed,
and weeds destroyed, without levelling the rows.  He has
likewise invented a plough, the lock of which is so formed
as to render a coulter, (once thought so essential), with all
its train of plates and wedges, an useless incumbrance.  He
has made improvements, too, on the curved mould-board
and the chain-muzzle.
