     Statistical Account

In a rainy season the husbandman cannot always collect
day labourers sufficient to manage and bring home the
crop, so that part of it is sometimes lost.  This inconve-
nience is never known where cottagers are one of the pro-
ductions of the soil.
   The best arable land is let below 20 s. the acre.  No
rent is paid per advance.  No services are required, except
the carriage of some coals from Dundee.  A few of the
tenants have power to subset; but the privilege is not ge-
nerally granted.  The valued rent of both parishes is about
L. 1200 Scots; the real rent is L. 1270 Sterling.
   An acre of good land well cultivated produces, in suc-
cession, 10 bolls oats, pease 5 or 6, wheat 8, turnip valued
at L. 5 Sterling, barley 10 bolls, sown grass 180-240
stones of hay, besides another crop for green feeding the
same season.  The prices of grain and hay are regulated
by the market at Dundee.  The expence of labour, provi-
sions and implements of husbandry is the same as in the
neighbouring parish of Meigle, (see Vol. I. p. 515.)

   Inclosures.-Inclosing and subdividing, partly by stone-
walls, and partly by a ditch and bank set with quick, were
introduced about 30 years ago by the proprietor of Nevay.
A great proportion of the whole district is now inclosed
with fences of the latter kind, which shelter the fields from
inclement blast more effectually than stone walls, but in a
calm and moist season prevent a free circulation of air, and
thereby prove hurtful to the crop.  The ditches, however,
being sufficient drains, render the fields in all seasons fit for
cultivation.  The practice of pruning hedges, so as to make
the top slat and the sides perpendicular, prevails.  A bet-
ter plan has been adopted in some neighbouring districts,
viz. to slope both sides gradually till they meet in a sharp
ridge at top.  By this mode of dressing a hedge, every part
