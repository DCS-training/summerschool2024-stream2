     Statistical Account

   Form, Extent, Surface, and Climate.-This parish is of
an irregular figure.  It extends from E. to W. 4 miles, and
from N. to S., in some places, about 5.  The surface is un-
even; a considerable part of it is hilly, and forms a part of
that ridge of hills, called the Ochills.  The low ground,
bounded by the rivers Tay and Earn on the N. and the
hills on the S. are nearly an oblong square; in length from
E. to W. about 4 English miles, and in breadth from N. to
S. about 1 1/2.  There is a bank of a gentle rise, that runs dia-
gonally through this square.  It begins in a point on the Tay
at the north-eastern extremity of the parish, and extends nearly
in a line to the foot of the hills, not far from the western ex-
tremity.  All below this bank, to the banks of the Tay and
the Earn, which may be about two thirds of the low ground,
is flat, and the soil artificial.  As the air is salubrious, there
is no disease peculiar to this parish.  The prejudices against
inoculation are wearing off.  No part of the country can af-
ford better diversion to the sportsman for hares, partridges,
foxes, etc.

   Soil.-About 25 feet below the surface of this flat ground,
and; 4 feet below the highest spring tide mark in the rivers
Tay and Earn, there is uniformly a stratum of roofs, from 1
to 3 feet thick.  This moss is a composition of the wood and
leaves of some trees, such as oak, aller, hazle, birch, etc.
The foil above this bed of moss is composed of strata of clay
and land, of different thickness, and of different colours and
qualities.  The land for rise most part is very small, and in
colour brown and white; the clay orange and blue, and in
some places the one, and in other places the other is at the
surface.  The soil of this flat then, upon that account, is vari-
ous.  The land, indeed, even in the composition of the soil,
and its extent upon the surface, bears but a small proportion
