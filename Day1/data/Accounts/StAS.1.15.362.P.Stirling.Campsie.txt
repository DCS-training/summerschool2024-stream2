     Statistical Account

   Poor.-Every attempt hath been made by the heritors and
session to discourage begging; as yet their efforts have proved
abortive; and although at this moment there is not a single
person in this parish understood to be a common beggar, we
are still pestered with vagrants.  The poor which we coun-
tenance as such, generally reside along with their children,
or some near relation; they receive their allowance on the
first Monday of each month; 6 s. per month is the highest
sum given; none receive less than three; at an average there
are 20 constantly upon our list.  The funds from which they
are paid are the collections at the church door, the mort-
cloth fees and proclamation money, together with the inter-
est of 570 L. of which 500 L. is secured on heritable property
at 5 per cent interest, payable twice in the year:  The other
70 L. is lodged in bank, payable on demand in case of an e-
mergency; from those funds we have been able as yet to sup-
supply the wants of our poor.  The collections at the sacra-
ment, including the preparation and the thanksgiving days, are
applied to the relief of those indigent householders, whose si-
situation is not so pressing as to make them objects of the or-
dinary charity.  Although it is believed that the law allows
kirk sessions to take possession of the effects belonging to the
paupers, so soon as they grant them supply; we have anxious-
ly avoided being too strict in this particular; for, callous as
the relations of the pauper may be, it is still an inducement
for them to assist a little; whereas, if they had no prospect of
succeeding to the trumpery, small as it, is, the whole care of
their relation would be thrown upon the parish; and it is
well known that 18 d per week is not adequate to all the ne-
cessities of lodging, clothing, and feeding a pauper.  The
English system is to support the poor, the Scotch to assist
them
