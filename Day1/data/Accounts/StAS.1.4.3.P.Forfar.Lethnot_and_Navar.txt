farms, which lie scattered on the West-water and other
small rivulets, extending a good way among the hills in a
north-west direction from the church of Lethnot, the most
distant being upwards of five miles from it.

   Soil, Marl, &c.-The soil in both parishes is various, some
of it is of a clay nature, some a rich loam with a till bot-
tom, and there is some haugh ground adjacent to the West-
water with a sandy bottom.  The ancient name of the
West-water was Dy; it has its source among the hills about
twelve miles north-west from the church of Lethnot, and it
recives in its progress a great number of rapid rivulets.
There are appearances of unshapely rocks here and there
on its banks, and a one place there is found limestone of a
reddish sandy nature, mixed with veins of freestone.  The
farmers quarry the limestone, and find it to answer well
with their lands.  But there is no freestone quarry within
the parishes, and though some of the rocks, which seem in
general to be composed of what is commonly called scurdy
stone, might answer for building, yet there is no quarry of
them opened for that purpose.  There is in the hell of Wir-
ran, a species of rock of a bluish colour, and of a very fine
texture, very like to that of the small blue slates, from which
the farmers quarry lintels for doors and windows.  They
can have these pieces almost of any length and breadth they
please; but as the rock is at some distance, it is seldom
wrought.  What is of greater consequence to some to the
farms of the parishes is a vein of clay or rock marl, which
runs from the east end of Lethnot to the west of Navar, in
a line nearly east by north to west by south.  This vein ex-
tends beyond the boundaries of the parishes.  It is found
on the lands of Balfour at the distance of five miles east, and
it is found a little north of the House of Fasque, the seat of
Sir Alexander Ramsay, at the distance of seven miles from
