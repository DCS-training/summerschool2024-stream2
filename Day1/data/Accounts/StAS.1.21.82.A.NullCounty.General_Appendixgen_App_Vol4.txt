called Roffie Den, and a great deal of thriving planting in it.
Of late years he has planted a great many fruit trees of vari-
ous kinds on the east side of the den, which are in a very
thriving state.  There is another den on the west side of his
Lordship's park, running up from Balledgarno about a mile;
in it there is also a great deal of fine planting.  Both dens are
his Lordship property.  In each of the dens there is a small
rivulet; they take their rise in the hill grounds, and meet at
one point, viz. at the bridge of Moncur, half a mile east from
this village.  The fine turnpike road lately matte betwixt
Perth and Dundee crosses that bridge; anti there the rivulets
united, run in one channel to south east, on the west: side of
Castle Hunty, for near three miles, and fall into the Tay,
near Monorgan, a seat in the parish of Long-Forgan.  Castle
Huntley, Mr. Paterson's seat, is likewise in that parish.  In
the rivulent there is excellent trout fishing for the entertainment
of the sportsman with the fishing rod.

Town Farm; where very old foundations have been dug up.
Ballindean is said to signify  the town of the steep brae.
Moncur is said to have got its appellation from a former
proprietor's name.  It is the ruin of a castle, and adjoins to
Lord Kinnaird's park.  His Lordship has lately planted trees
and shrubbery around it.  In this carse there are many drains
or ditches; some of them are called Pow, or Pol.  Pewgavie
or Polgavie, seems to have got its name from its situation.  It
is a village on the banks of the Tay, adjoining to one of
these large drains.-Here there is a pier and a good harbour
for shipping; and at this pier, since I gave an account of this
