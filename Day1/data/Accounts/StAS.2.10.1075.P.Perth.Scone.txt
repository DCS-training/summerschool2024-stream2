	are derived from church door collections, nearly L.60; interest
	of money, above L.45 ; fees on mortcloth, and for the last two
	years, a voluntary assessment, on the part of the heritors, amounting,
	in 1841, to L.80, and in 1842, to L.60.  The sum of L.40 is
	paid by the trustees of the Cupar Angus turnpike road, as interest
	on L.1000 lent them.  This sum of L.1000 was the price paid
	by Lord Mansfield for some ground belonging to tbe poor at Old
	Scone, and which was sold to his Lordship at the time of the re-
	moval.  Continued privation seems to prevent the poor from feeling
	that it is degrading to accept relief.  With a few exceptions, those
	who once begin to receive parochial aid, continue to take it without
	much hesitation.  A number of individuals, not on the list of or-
	dinary poor, have been in the habit of receiving from the family
	at Scone Palace, for many years, assistance in the way of coals
	and flannel, besides other benefits.  This is continued in all its
	fulness up to the present date.  The Earl of Mansfield has given
	much employment to those inhabitants of the parish able to un-
	dertake out-of-door labour,-a method of doing good still better
	than merely giving charity.
	   Inns,&c.- There are within the parish nine taverns in which
	ardent spirits may be procured.  There can be no doubt that
	they have an injurious effect on the morals of the people.
	   Fuel.-The fuel generally consumed is sea-coal, procured from
	Perth, at the rate of from 15s. to L.1 per ton, besides the cartage
	and toll.  Scotch coal is also used, being brought for sale, during
	the summer and autumn months, from the collieries in Fife.  A
	considerable quantity of oak, from which the bark has been re-
	moved for the use of the tanner, is also consumed, together with
	brushwood from the plantations.
