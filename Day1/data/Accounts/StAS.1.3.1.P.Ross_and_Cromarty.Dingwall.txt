     PARISH OF DINGWALL.

     (County of Ross.)

     By the Rev. Mr DANIEL ROSE.

     Situation and Boundaries.

   THE parish of Dingwall, situated at the west end of the
Frith of Cromarty, lies in the presbytery of Dingwall,
of which the town of that name is the seat, and in the synod
and country of Ross.  It is bounded on the east by the parish
of Kiltearn; on the north lie a vast tract of high mountains;
and on the west and south by the parish of Fodderty.  That
part of the parish of Urquhart, called Ferrintosh, lies on the
skirt to the south-east; but from it Dingwall is divided by
the river Conan, which, at high water, is widened to about 
half a mile by the influx of the sea.
