   Population.-Upon comparing the present amount of an-
nual baptisms, with that of any particular period, for a consi-
derable time past, the state of this parish, with respect to po-
pulation, does not appear to have been materially altered.
Owing to the enlargement of farms, to the demolition of
cottages, and to the increase of manufactures in the neigh-
bourhood, (to which persons of all ages resort), its popula-
tion might, perhaps, be supposed on the decline.  Yet it is a
fact, that the return to Dr Webster amounted only to
551; and, at present, the number of parishioners, young
and old, are not under 700*.  They are mostly farm-
ers, some are lime quarriers, some day-labourers, and there
are a few of those tradesmen, who are essentially necessa-
ry in every country parish+.  At an average for the last
5 years, there have been 6 marriages, 14 baptisms, and 9
burials, annually.
