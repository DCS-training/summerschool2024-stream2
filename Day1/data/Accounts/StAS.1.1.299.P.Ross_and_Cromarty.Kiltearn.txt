     of Kiltearn.

When he obtained his liberty he retired to Holland, where
he was highly esteemed for his learning the piety.  There is a 
pamphlet published, containing memoirs of his life, and many
remarkable anecdotes of him.  There are several facts well
attested, which indicate that he had a remarkable presenti-
ment of future events respecting the Church in general, and
himself in particular.  Even at a period when, to all human
appearance, it was most unlikely, and when he was obliged
to fly from his country and charge, he soretold, with the
most assured confidence, that there would be such a revolu-
tion as happened afterwards, and that he should return to his
charge at Kiltearn, and be buried there; which accordingly
turned out as he had said.  And, in consideration of his emi-
nent worth, and great sufferings, King William was pleased
to appoint him one of his Chaplains for Scotland; but he
died very soon after his appointment, at Kiltearn, in 1692,
and is buried at the entry to the south-west door of the
church.  Some person, out of respect for his memory, and
zealous to express the sense he had of Mr Hogg's uncommon
worth, caused the following singular inscription to be put on
his grave-stone: "This stone will witness against the pa-
" rishioners of Kiltearn, if ever they bring in an ungodly
" minister here." But, while we pay the just tribute of praise
to those whose stations advantages of education enabled
them to distinguish themselves in the world, it would be un-
just to overlook those blossoms of genius that shoot forth in
the humble walks of life.  Here, a watchmaker in this parish
naturally occurs to our view.  This man (now about 30 years
of age) was born and brought up in the Highland district of
this parish, and, although he never saw a watch or clock till
he was grown up to manhood, yet, by mere intuition, has
made several clocks of coarse materials, which go well.  He
only wants a little instruction and assistance to make a figure
