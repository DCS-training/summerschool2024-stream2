each of the thirty-four furnaces to yield 100 tons per week, the an-
nual produce will be 176,80O tons per annum.  For producing a
ton of iron, 3 tons of coals, and from 5 Io 6 cwt. of lime are re-
quired.  Allowing 3 tons of coals as above for the, manufacture
of one ton of iron, the thirty-four furnaces now in blast will alonw
consume 530,400 tons of coal per annum, and at least 884,000
cwts. of lime.  These iron-works alone consume an equal amount
of coals in a year, as the city of Glasgow, including the different
manufactories and public works, and more lime than is consumed
by all the farmers in the county of Lanark.  ln 1806, the produce
of pig-iron throughout the whole county of Lanark was only from
9000 to 10,000 tons per annum, and the coals consumed about
130,000 tons.  In the beginning of 1794, the produce of pig iron
was only 3600 tons, by which 36,000 tous of coals were con-
sumed.
   The state of iron trade at these several periods will stand

   Several of the iron companies in this parish are directing their
attention to the manufacture of bar iron.  The Monkland Com-
pany are procuring mills and forges capable of produciag 220 or
230 tons of malleable iron per week; and the Dundyvan Company
are also making suitable preparations for the same purpose, on a
still more extensive scale.  The steam-engines employed at seve-
ral of the above works are very powerful.  At Gartherrie, there
are two engines, the one has a steam-cylinder, 90 inches diame-
ter, and an air-cylinder, 80 inches.  The second engine has a
steam-cylinder, 48 inches, and air-cylinder, 90 inches diameter.
At Dundyvan, the steam-cylinder of the engine is 45 inches, and
the air-cylinder, 90 inches in diameter. At Monkland, the steam-
cylinder is 42 inches; the air-cylinder, 77.  At Clyde Iron works,
the steam-cylinder is 40 inches, the air-cylinder, 80.  At Sum-
merlee, the steam-cylinder is 48 inches, the air-cylinder, 93. At
Calder, there are two engines, one of 52, and another of 40 horse
power.  At Gartsherrie, the air-vessels substituted for the water-
pressure or regulator are of enormous size.  The largest is 11
feet diameter, and 43 feet high, and has a capacity within of 4000
square feet; the lesser is 10 feet diameter, and 40 feet high, and
contains an area of 3000 square feet.  The whole of these iron-
