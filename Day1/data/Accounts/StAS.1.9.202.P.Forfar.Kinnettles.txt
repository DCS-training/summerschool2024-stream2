grated.  None have been banished, or obliged to leave
the parish for want of employment.  No uninhabited
houses.  The number of the inhabited is 126; the propor-
tion of houses to the number of inhabitants is as 1: 4 117/126.
On account of the increased size of farms, and the practice
of inclosing, population does not seem to be so great now
as it was 25 years ago.  Farmers were then accustomed to
have 1 or 2 houses on their farms, with a small quantity of
land, which were intended for the accommodation of one
or two married servants.  Since the inclosing and labour-
ing of ground with attention have taken place, that ac-
commodation for married servants is withdrawn, and o-
ther servants are thereby discouraged from marrying.  The
servant finds, too, that when married, he cannot so easily
find a place with a farmer, whom, perhaps, he would be
most willing to serve; nor are masters, in general, fond of
retaining married servants.  In fact, there is no class a-
mong whom marriages are so infrequent, as farmers ser-
vants.

   Productions, Agriculture, etc.-Almost all the vegetables,
plants and trees in Scotland are to be found here, and thrive
in our soil and climate; and we have such animals as are
common to the low countries of Scotland.  Rent of best a-
rable land is from 18 s. to L. 1, 5 s. the acre.  Size of farms
is from 42 to 200 acres, and upwards.  Farms, at an ave-
rage, about L. 88 yearly.  There is at least 4-5ths of the
parish inclosed.  The number of acres under the different
crops, at present, is nearly as follows:-583 in oats, 335 in
barley, 26 in wheat, 33 in pease, 28 in lint, 84 in turnips,
22 in potatoes, 174 in cutting grass, and 777 in pasture; a-
mounting in all to nearly 206 5 1/2 acres.  There are 31 ploughs,
drawn by 3 or 4 horses; 56 carts; 1 coach; 1 two-wheel-
ed chaise.  Exclusive of what some heritors retain in their
