   The districts assigned to the new churches, with the exception
of a small part of Levern, are all taken from the overgrown parishes
included in this report.  The numbers and denominations within
their bounds are included in the above table.  Still it may be sa-
tisfactory to have these particulars stated in regard to the new pa-
rishes, so far as they have been obtained.  The following table
exhibits the numbers and denominations assigned from the Abbey
to the parishes of Johnston and Levern. +

   About 1600 of the inhabitants of Charleston, out of a popula-
tion of 4000, have been placed und intendence of the
minister of the South Church.  The other part of his pastoral
charge is detached from St George's parish.  The districts assign-
ed as parishes to the other two new churches are taken each from
the old parish, within whose bounds the church is situated, and
comprise each a population of from 3000 to 3600.
   The new places of worship are not yet filled.  But since their
opening, in the course of two years, they have added upwards of
1000 to the number of sitters in the Establishment,-an evident
proof of the former want of church accommodation, in this place,

<FOOTNOTE>four parishes cannot fail to attract notice.  The difference is owing entirely to the
diffierent principles on which the survey was made.  In the Abbey and Middle pa-
rishes, the question was decided by the replies of the parties themselves.  In the High
and Low parishes, the question as to religious profession was determined, not exclu-
sively by the claims of the parties, but by the actual information possessed by the el-
ders who made the scutiny, and by the replies that were given to such specific ques-
tions as, What church do you attend?  How many sittings have you?  What is the
name of the minister you hear? &c.  After all, even in this way, we only approximate
to the truth; and we strongly fear, that the numbers, even as marked in the High
and Low parishes, fall considerably short of those degraded masses of corrupt society
which are sunk in all the darkness of a state of practical atheism.
          The reason of so great a population having been assigned to the minister of John-
ston, is that the same district was placed under his superintendence forty years ago,
when the population, within the perambulated bounds, was only about 1500, and it was
not thought advisable to make any change in this arrangement, that populous place
being regarded more in the light of an overgrown parish, than as a portion to be de-
tached from the Abbey.
          In addition to the 1800 from the Abbey, it is proposed to add to the Levern
about 400 from the parishes of Neilston and Eastwood, whose residence is in the
neighbourhood of that place of worship, making in all about 2200.
