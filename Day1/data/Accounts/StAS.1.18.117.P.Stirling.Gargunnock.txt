     of Gargunnock.

mains of a ditch or rampart of a circular form, which proves
that it is not of Roman origin.  It is probably of later date,
and appears to have been the place from which Sir William
Wallace fallied forth on the night when he took by surprize
the Peel of Gargunnock.
   In one of the dryfields of Boquhan, some pieces of brass
armour and points of spears were found a few years ago by
a tenant, when digging for limestone.  A great quantity of hu-
man bones were also discovered in the same spot, the remains
probably of the slain at the battle of Ballochleam, which was
fought in the adjoining fields.
   There is no object of natural curiosity in this parish equal
to the glen of Boquhan.  The road made on the east side
by the present proprietor, leads to a most romantic view.
But, if a person has leisure and perseverance to descend and
walk along the bottom of the glen, at the field of Old-hall,
he will be surprized at every step, with a scene perfectly wild,
as though nature were in ruins.

   Local Disadvantages.-This parish is situated on the north
side of the hill.  In the higher parts of the dryfields, the sun
is not seen during the winter months.  Coal must be brought
from Bannockburn, 10 miles distant; for although marks of
coal can be observed in several places within the parish, no at-
tempts have been made to discover it.  The tenants on the
banks of the Forth have boats, but these in their present state
are found inconvenient and dangerous for horses and loaded
carts.  A bridge is much wanted near the lands of Mickle-
wood.  The one at the ford of the Frew, does not suffi-
ciently accommodate the inhabitants of a tract of fertile
country, for many miles on both sides of the river.
