              III.-POPULATION.
  The ancient state of the population previous to the return made
to Dr Webster, when its amount was 940, there are no means of ascertaining.
Between the date of that return and of the former Statistical Account,
a period of about forty years, there appears to have
been a decrease of 188, and between that and the census of 1811
there appears to have been a further decrease of 118, owing, in
both cases, most probably, to the diminution of the number of
crofters and subtenants. Since the census of 1811, there has been
a gradual increase, occasioned, no doubt, in some degree, by the
encouragement given to settlers in the uncultivated parts of the
parish, near the moss.

  Character, &c. of the People. - The people are in general healthy.
There are many instances of longevity. * Their habits are sober
and industrious, with few exceptions. They live very plainly, and,

<FOOTNOTE>There are various aged females on the verge of ninety,-and one ninety-six, who was
till within these two years in the habit of attending church though she had more than
a mile of very rough ground (not read,) to walk to it, with ditches in her way, and
the burn to cress either on stepping-stones or on a plank.  A man died last winter
aged ninety-seven. The elder, commemorated in the former Statistical Accaunt as the
father of three females born at a birth, died within these few year in the ninety third
year of his age, and was able, even at that very advanced period of life, occasionally
to attend church, though at the distance of nearly two miles. It may be inte-
