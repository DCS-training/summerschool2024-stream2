     Statistical Account

   Rent, etc.-The rent of the parish is supposed to
be about L. 3210 Scots, or about L. 270 sterling, which, how-
ever, is to much below its real value, that, when any land, in
the parish, is sold, it generally fetches about 50 years pur-
chase.  To account for this, it may not be improper to ob-
serve, that the rents, as paid by the tenants, give a very ina-
dequate view of the landlord's income.  For although it may
be true, that the lands are let by the proprietor, or tacksman,
at no higher rent, than what is above stated, yet it is invaria-
bly on this condition, that the tenant, or fishing farmer, shall
deliver to his land-master, or order, every article, that he can
aise, (viz. fish, oil, butter etc.) at a certain fixed price; by
the fale of which, the landlord more than doubles his rent.
As a proof of this, it may be stated, that two considerable
landholders, finding it incovenient for them, to receive their
rents from their tenants, in this manner, (partly in money and
partly in kind,) let their lands to tacksmen, who give, at
least, double the nominal rent paid by the tenats, and
find their account in it.  Other landholders, however,
make more by receiving the tenants product themselves,
or by their servants under their own eye; and would not
let their lands in large parcels, even for double the rent
paid in money.

   Occupations.-There are but few mechanics, or tradesmen,
in these parishes, the useful arts not having yet made their
appearance here, in any great perfection.  Wool, it is true,
the staple commodity of the country, so remarkable for its
fineness and softness, might be a source of industry and opu-
lence; yet, in the way it has been hitherto been managed, it
turns to very small account.  All the women, of every rank
and distinction, are employed in spinning wool, and knitting
fine and coarse stockings, to their great loss, and miserable
