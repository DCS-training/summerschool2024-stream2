     General Appendix to

   The fishings in this parish are hardly worth mentioning,
though indeed they are in no degree preserved or attended
to.  Minerals are, at present, of no account.  But there is
a great deal of freestone, very accessible; and though inferior
in quality at the top, it may improve.  We have a great deal
of excellent shell marl, which may be opened up at a trifling
expence; and every person of observation reckons on these
as future articles of importance towards the general produce
of the parish.  With respect to manufactures, we have no-
thing to reckon upon except some coarse cloths and linens,
to the value of 200 l. or from that to 300 l. a year, grown,
spun, made, and worn, within the parish.

   Manures.-Lime is the chief article, at present, under
this head.  Nothing answers our old ley ground so well.  Six
carts, of hot shells, containing each 15 sleeks of the Win-
chester bushel, are laid on an acre.  The approved way is to
scatter it on the surface of old ley ground, and break it next
season; the next method is to scatter the lime on the drills,
with a green crop, and incorporate it into the soil by the
plough and harrows.  The former method gives the earliest
profit, in rich crops of oats; the other is the best method to
ensure good grass after the green fallow, and to leave the soil
out, in heart.
   Most of the dung goes to the potatoe crop; some is used
for turnip, or for barley.  We begin to dislike the old prac-
tice of spreading dung upon pasture land, and plowing down
for oats.  On meadow, duly drained, it repays largely.
   Composts of lime and earth are only trying yet; but it is
easy to see that they will soon become common.
   The carriage of the lime(19 miles) is equal to the prime
cost; and altogether, an acre costs 3 l. to lime it; which is a
