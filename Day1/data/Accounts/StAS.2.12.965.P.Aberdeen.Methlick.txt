band pan, which eats away the improvement.  A subsoil of clay
is not common.  There is a great extent of peat moss in the pa-
rish, which, however, is being annually reduced, and brought into
a state of cultivation.
   Botany, Zoology, Ornithology, &c.-Some of the less common
plants are,

Chrysosplenium alternifo-   Trientalis Europaea    Habenaria viridis
    lium                    Agrimonia Eupatoria    Hippuris vulgaris
Listera cordata             Menyanthes trifoliata  Circaea lutetiana

Myrica Gƒle               Plantago maritima      Galium Witheringii

Vaccinium Vitis-Idaea       Gnaphalium sylvaticum  Lysimachia nemorurn.
Genista analica             Juniperus communis

   The plants most commonly met with are those which have
found their way into the vernacular tongue, such as the gowan, or
the daisy ; the horse-gowan, or dandelion ; the tansy, or ragwort;
blue bells, or common bell flower; dead man's bells, or foxglove;
chickenwort, or chickweed; dockens, or dock ; arnut, or earth-
nut; sit sikker, or creeping crowfoot; sooraks, or sheep's sorrel;
&c. &c.
   The Scotch fir and the common spruce agree well with the soil
and climate.  A great variety of foreign pines have been planted in
the immediate neighbourhood of his mansion, by the noble proprie-
tor, with various success.  The Pinus Cembra appears to thrive very
well in the policies, and to have become in a manner naturalized
in the country.  A very fine specimen of the Pinus Clanbrassiliana
was lately discovered in the midst of the wood near Haddo House,
being the produce of promiscuous planting.  It measures 36 inches
in height, and is nearly thirty-six years old.
   In gardens, the raspberry, the gooseberry, the currant, and
the strawberry, are produced in abundance, and of excellent qua-
lity ; but neither the soil nor the climate appears to favour the
production of apples or pears, or even cherries.
   Zoology.-The following is a list of the wild animals which are
found in the parish, so far as I have been able to ascertain their
existence.
