were bought by William Forbes, Esq; the present proprie-
tor.
   The whole estates, together with some other farms
which were purchased by him about the same time, a-
mounted to about 8000 Scotch acres; almost 7000 of
these are in this parish.  Excepting about 500 acres, it
was all arable; but little more than 200 of it were inclo-
sed.  The whole farms were out of lease, and the tenants
were all removed as soon as they could provide themselves,
with other situations, in order that there might be no ob-
struction to the intended improvements.
   Almost the whole of there estates is now inclosed and
subdivided.  The fences are, as much as possible, drawn at
right-angles to one another; the ridges are straightened;
and the wet parts are drained, or in the train of being
done with all convenient speed.  The inclosures which are
near the town of Falkirk or the villages adjoining, contain
each from three to four Scotch acres of land; but those
which are in different situations, comprehend from seven to
eight acres of the same measure.
   About 2000 acres, which are near the canal and in the
vicinity of Falkirk, were limed upon the green sward, and
let to tenants for the space of two years, who were bound
to lay them down with grass-seeds in the last year of their
lease.  A considerable part of the land, which was over-
run by heath, broom and furze, was let to tenants also, who
were to plough it five times.  This in like manner was to
be laid down for grass; but in both cases the grass-seeds
were to be provided by the proprietor, and at his expence.
   These improvements will not only add much to the
beauty of a district already delightful; but when comple-
ted, will add much to the richness of this neighbourhood.
It is one distinguishing feature in the improvements of Mr
Forbes, that they are intended to be completed before he
