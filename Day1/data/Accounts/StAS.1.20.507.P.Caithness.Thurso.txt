   "6.  That previous preparation is most commonly neces-
sary."
   "I cannot help noticing, that the population of Scotland,
has frequently been so diminished by the small-pox, as to
call for an effectual remedy.  We have it in inoculation,
and yet the ancient fatal superstition is so little overcome,
that many parts are either unacquainted that such a benefit
exists, or little pains are taken to recommend it.  As the
Highland Society is so distinguised for its patriotic exer-
tions, would it not be a most laudable effort in them, to
adopt measures for promoting general inoculation, by al-
lowing prizes to the surgeons who are most useful in that
line."
   The following observations are drawn up by the same
gentleman, respecting the diseases to which the people of
this county are usually subject.
   "The diseases are occationally very alarming.  Fevers,
generally designed nervous and putrid, are common, and
very fatal, arising, in some degree, from the marshy efflu-
via; there is, however, a more general cause."
   "From Wick, along the eastern and northern coast, to
Dunnet, farmers depend on sea-ware for manure; to render
it more effectual, the putrefactive process is promoted, by
collecting it into considerable heaps.  In that putrid state it
remains during summer, when collected, to the spring en-
suing.  It is particularly fatal during summer and harvest,
when the wind blows from the west to the east, the putrid
effuvia being sent over a considerable extent of country.
To give a short account of the result, in many cases I have
had under my eye, and from what information I could col-
lect, the common symptoms of low nervous fever has thence
appeared: in two days after, violent delirium, and incessant
vomiting; the event of which, between the fourth and the
sixth day, was commonly fatal."
