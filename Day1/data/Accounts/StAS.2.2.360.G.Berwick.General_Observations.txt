	  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

		  ON THE

	    COUNTY OF BERWICK.

BY THE REV. JOHN EDGAR, A. M. MINISTER OF HUTTON.


   Name.-THE ancient name of Berwickshire was the Merse,
which it probably derived from its local situation as a border or
march district. This name, however, appears to have been restrict-
ed to the lower and more fertile part of the county, while the hilly
and more sterile district was denominated Lammermoor. It is
difficult to ascertain the precise limits of these two divisions, and
the distinction is now only nominal. The only occasion on which
it is recognized is at the striking of the fiars of the county,-the
price of Lammermoor grain being fixed at a lower rate than that
of the Merse. It is almost superfluous to observe that this County
derives its present name frnm the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed,
in its immediate vicinity. With this ancient place, though not
within its territorial limits, and though governed by English laws,
Berwickshire is intimately connected. It is the only town of con-
siderable importance, either for population or trade, in the district,
and the principal sea port whence the corn, wool, and other agri-
cultural produce of the county are exported.
   Situation and Extent.-This county is situated betwixt 1&deg;; 41'
and 2&deg;; 34' of West Long. from London ; and betwixt 55&deg;; 36' 30"
