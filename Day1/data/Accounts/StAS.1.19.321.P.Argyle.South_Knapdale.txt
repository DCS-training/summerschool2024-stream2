     of South Knapdale.

   Mountains.-Of these there is no scarcity.  The most
remarkable are Cruach Lusach, i.e. the hill of plants or
herbage, from the great number of herbs growing on it,
and Sliahh Gavil, (a mountain separated at both ends).  It
is twelve miles long, and eight broad at the safe; it be-
longs to the Duke of argyle.

   Woods and Caves.-Some parts of the parish abound with
natural woods, or coppices of oak, ash, birch and hazel.
Several of them are well inclosed with proper fences.-
Although there are not a few caves in the parish, yet none
are of consequence but one, near which is a chapel, with an
alter and font.  The farm in which it is situated is called
the Cove.

   Ecclesiastical State.-This parish contains three places
of worship.  On is at Tarbert, thirteen computed miles
from the church at which the minister resides.  In this
chapel it was the custom, till of late, for the minister to
preach every sixth Sabbath: Now a missionary is establish-
ed there by the Society for Propagating Christian know-
ledge.  There is another chapel about five miles from the
church.  The present incumbent, Mr Daniel Hyndman,
was admitted to the charge in 1771.  His predecessors
were, Mr Patrick Pollock, first minister of this parish, after
the disjunction from North Knapdale; and Mr Hugh
Campbell, now minister of Kilmartin.  The King is pa-
tron.
   The present incumbent, when he came to the parish,
found neither a church, or proper place of worship, in the
whole bounds.  There was not a globe nor manse.  The 
stipend was only L.47, with L.1, 16s. for communion-
elements.  In the year 1772, he was under the necessity of
suing the heritors at law before he could prevail upon them
