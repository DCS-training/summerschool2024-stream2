     Statistical Account

of black cattle, 500 horses, 1,000 goats, and 60,000 sheep.
Before the mode of sheep-farming was introduced, a great
number of horses were reared for sale.  They were well shaped,
hardy, and high mettled.  Good ones now fell at from 8 L. to 20 L.
Owing to their decreasing in number every season, they have
advanced in price considerably, of late years.  They are used
in ploughing, harrowing, leading home peats, and carrying
manure to the fields.  Four of them, are yoked a-breast in the
plough; and a man, who leads them, stands immediately be-
fore them, and walks backward, facing the ploughman.  This,
surely, is very aukward!  The gentlemen in the parish, how-
ever, yoke but two horses in the plough; and the one who
holds it, manages also the reins.  Three different kinds of
ploughs are used.-The sheep were first introduced, into the
parish, in the year 1764.  They have since increased so much,
that about three fourths of the country are occupied by them.
Wherever they are, there is not above the 1300dth acre in
tillage.  Hence the quantity of hill ground may be conceived.
But, indeed, the vallies are mostly pasture walks, for the win-
ter and spring retreat of the sheep, as well as of the black cat-
tle.-All the hills, below the perpendicular altitude of 600
yards, are lined with beautiful, soft, and rich heath; but,
above that height, they are mostly barren.  There is no com-
mon in the parish.

   Produce, Cultivation, etc.-Oats, barley, and potatoes, are
the principal crops.  The climate and soil here are ill calcu-
lated for rearing grain.  In the best season, the crop is
precarious, and hardly equivalent to the expences incurred,
Potatoes, which are mostly planted in drills, answer remark-
ably well; and turnips, it is believed, would turn to good ac-
count, particularly to the sheep farmer.  Hitherto, however,
little attention has been bestowed upon them.  Oats are sown
