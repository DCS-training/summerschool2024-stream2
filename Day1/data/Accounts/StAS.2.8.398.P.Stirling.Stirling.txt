clay is also found of an unknown depth, abounding with rolled
blocks.  The head of a Deer or Stag, was found in the brick
field to the north of the town near the river.  In the lower part
of the parish, as throughout the Carse of Stirling, of which it forms
a part, the soil is entirely alluvial; and is believed to rest on the
coal-formation. In the higher parts the soil is gravelly.  The
plants most frequently and peculiarly attached to the soil are furze
and broom; in the King's Park, the latter only.  An attempt was
lately made to find coal immediately under the high ground con-
tiguous to the Castle-hill to the north; but none was obtained worth
working, at a depth of upwards of 70 fathoms.
   Zoology and Botany.--The rarer animals found in the parish
are the polecat, the otter, the black-snake, and the adder.
The wolf and the red-deer formerly existed in the district;
but have been long extinct. The cattle, sheep, horses, &c. bred
in the parish are not distinguished in any way from those that are
reared in the adjoining-country. In the river are found salmon,
grilse, sparlings or smelts, pike, perch, trout, eels, and flounders.
Of these the three first mentioned are of great importance. Sal-
mon and grilse furnish a highly prized article of food, and con-
stitute also a branch of profitable trade, many being exported.
They come up the river to spawn in spring, and return to the sea
in autumn. The sparling makes its appearance for some time in
spring; and is, while it remains, a favourite article of food espe-
cially with the lower classes.
   The following rare, or otherwise interesting native plants, have
their habitats on the Castle and Gowland hills, viz.-
