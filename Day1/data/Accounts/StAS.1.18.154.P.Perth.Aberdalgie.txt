only that they were perfectly reconciled to it, but that they
considered themselves as under great obligations to him, for
introducing among them a system of farming so highly advan-
tageous.  In consequence of this improved state of the farms,
the parish has now a very different face, from what it had
when his Lordship came to take up his residence here.  At
that time there were no grass seeds sown, and no wheat
excepting a small quantity sown by the parish minister and
one of his neighbours; but now, there are several acres an-
nually sown with grass seeds, and several with wheat by al-
most every farmer.  Now also much good oats is seen grow-
ing in several places, where, at that time, there was not pas-
ture sufficient for a single sheep.  Hence the rent has been
nearly doubled; and yet, being designedly kept moderate, it
is chearfully and punctually paid.  The crops raised, besides
wheat, clover, and rye-grass, are oats, barley, peas, beans,
potatoes, turnips, and lint.  Of the three last, the quantity is
not great.  The rotation of crops which seems to be
most approved, but to which few strictly adhere, is, the
year after a summer fallow, wheat; 2 d, pease and beans;
3 d, barley, with grass seeds; 4th, clover, and rye-grass;
5th, oats.

   Poor.-The poor at present upon the parish roll, are 7 in
number.  The money arising from collections at the church,
fees of mort-cloth, marriages, etc. is not nearly sufficient for
their maintenance; but happily for them they have a good
friend in Lord Kinnoul.  His Lordship, whether residing in
the parish, or absent from it, not only continues to give the
same weekly sum which his uncle the late Lord gave at
church, but is ever ready, as his uncle was, to bestow
whatever additional sum is thought necessary for their com-
fortable subsistance.
