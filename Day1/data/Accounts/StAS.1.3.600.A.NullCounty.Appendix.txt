<APPENDIX>

   At the breaking up of this little society, which was form-
ed under Mr Riddell's patronage, what with benefactions of
books from him, and what with their own purchases, they
had collected together upwards of 150 volumes.  It will
easily be guested, that a good deal of trash would be bought.
Among the books, however, of this little library, were,
Blair's Sermons, Robertson's History of Scotland, Hume's
History of the Stewarts, the Spectator, Idler, Adventurer,
Mirror, Lounger, Observer, Man of Feeling, Man of the
World, Chrysal, Don Quixotte, Joseph Andrews, etc.  A
peasant who can read, and enjoy such books, is certainly a
much superior being to his neighbour, who, perhaps, stalks
beside his team, very little removed, except in shape, from the
brutes he drives.

   Wishing your patriotic exertions their so much merited
success,

     I am,

     SIR,

     Your humble servant,

     APEASANT.
