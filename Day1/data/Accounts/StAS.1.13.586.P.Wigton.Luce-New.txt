     Statistical Account

present state, the farmer must labour under considerable
difficulties.  It must be allowed, that the funds of the pa-
rish that are appropriated to this use are but small, being
not more than L. 15 yearly, which have hitherto been em-
ployed towards mending a few of the worst parts of the
roads, and the forming a by-road, which runs along the S.
end of the parish.

   Stipend, etc.-The living is L. 60 a year, together with
a glebe, consisting of from 16 to 20 acres of land, about 4
of which are not arable.  As for the manse, it is at present
in a state of ruins, but orders have been given for a new one
to be built.

   Antiquities,etc.-In this parish there is scarce any natural or
artificial curiosity that deserves being mentioned.  Towards
the N. E. side of it, there are two large stones that stand erect
on a small eminence, on one of which is cut the rude figure
of a cross, but I cannot learn that there is any tradition re-
specting them.  There are also several small cairns to be
met with in different parts of the parish, and upon remo-
ving the stones of some of them, urns have been found;
which affords a confirmation of the present prevailing opi-
nion respecting their having been burying places in former
times.

   Hint for Improvement.-This place seems to be advanta-
geously situated for erecting a woollen manufactory, as a
sufficiency of water may be had for driving a spinning-
mill, being not more that five miles distant from the bay
of Luce, where small vessels of 60 tons burthen, and up-
wards, may ride safe at anchor.
