     Poor and Parochial Funds.--The number of paupers at pre-
sent on the roll is 45.  The sum annually expended for their
support is about L. 280.  It is derived from assessments on the
heritors, and the interest of L. 1500 bequeathed to the parish by
a Mr More, a native of the place, who went out to India, where
he died.  The terms of the destination are, " for the sup-
port, maintenance, and education of real poor and destitute
orphans."   The heritors throw it into the general poor's fund.
They aliment, of course, the poor orphans, and also pay their
school fees.
     Fuel.--One of the greatest disadvantages under which the dis-
trict labours is the distance from coals, (about sevdnteen and
eighteen miles,) which are almost the only fuel used, or which
can be procured.
