 PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING.

        I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

   Name and Boundaries.-THE name Kippen is said to be de-
rived from a Gaelic word signifying a promontory; and is suppos-
ed to be descriptive of the situation of the village.
   The figure of the parish is irregular. Its greatest length is
about 8 miles, and its breadth is from 2 to nearly 4 miles. It
is bounded on the north by the river Forth, which separates it
from the parish of Port and the newly erected parish of Norries-
town; on the east, by Gargunnock; on the south, by Balfron;
and, on the west, by the parish of Drymen. It lies chiefly in
the county of Stirling; but, in different places, it is intersected
by portions of Perthshire, which run across it from north to south,
and form nearly a third part of the parish.
   Meteorology.--The temperature of the air is rather cold, owing

and east. The climate is somewhat damp, from the vicinity
of the parish to high mountains, and its consequent exposure to
frequent showers; but it is by no means considered unhealthy.
The showers, though frequent, are seldom very heavy, or of long
continuance. Snow seldom falls to any considerable depth,
nor does it in general lie long. Consumption has, perhaps,

   Hydrography.--Forth, the only river connected with this pa-
rish, and which divides it from the parishes of Port and Norries-
town, is here confined within narrow and deep banks; and its cur-
rent so slow as hardly to be perceptible.  Its waters are gene-
rally dark and muddy, from the quantity of moss which is floated
into it.
   There is, in the moor of Kippen, a small lake of water called
