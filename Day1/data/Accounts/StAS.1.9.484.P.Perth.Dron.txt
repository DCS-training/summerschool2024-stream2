present by the writer of this, has taken any notice of the
rocking stone of Dron.  That of Balvaird stands at the di-
stance of between 2, 3 miles east, on the banks of the
Farg, in the parish of Abernethy; but its motion is not
now perceptible, being choked up with earth and gravel close
to its centre.  For what particular purposes there stones, so
artfully formed, were erected, is at this distance of time a
matter rather of conjecture than certainty; but little doubt
can be entertained, that they were designed to he the silent
instruments of imposition on the credulity and ignorance of
the vulgar; the ingenious but dishonest contrivance of the
priest, or the politician, to serve their own interested views.
It may be observed here, as a sort of curiosity, that from
the great height of the Ochil hills, a number of houses in
this parish, which lie at the foot of these hills, are deprived
of the sun for 3 months of the winter, from the beginning
of November to the beginning of February, during which
period, the rigours of that season must be more severely
felt by the inhabitants; and scanty fires, (where fuel is
scarce and distant), afford but a sorry substitute for the
chearful rays and genial influences of that all animating lu-
minary.
