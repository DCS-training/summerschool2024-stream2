side of the hills first mentioned, commanding a full view of
Dumfries, and even beyond it towards Annandale, is called
Ingleston.-The tradition is, that it was so called from
the beacons or fires that were kindled there, or on the hill
belonging to it, in times of hostility with the English or bor-
derers, to give warning to other parts of the country, of the
approach of an enemy.  For the word Ingle (perhaps from
the Latin Ignis) to this day, is very often used for a fire by
the common people all over this country.-Game of most
kinds is as plenty here as in any of the neighbouring pa-
rishes.  Even the beautiful back cock, as well as the
grouse, is to be met with on the high grounds.  Foxes
bring forth in holes upon the bishop's forest formerly men-

his support.-Over a water which falls into the river Cairn,
is an excellent stone bridge of one arch.  It is founded
upon two perpendicular rocks, and forms a most romantic
scene.  As it is lower than the ground leading to it on each
end, you are surprised by the fight of it almost before you
are aware.  It is called the Routing bridge, evidently from
the noise made by the water immediately above it.  Stand-
ing upon the bridge, and looking up the stream, you see ve-
ry little of its course, till it begins, above the level of the
spectator's eye, to tumble in broken water, among large un-
equal rocks, for about 8 or 10 yards in a rapid descent, and
falls in a cataract of about 10 r 12 feet deep, so near the
