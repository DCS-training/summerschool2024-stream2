tery of Inverness; but I have been able to discover neither the time nor
the manner in which these patronages were lost.  At present they are
both in the gift of the Crown.
   I ought in justice to acknowledge the obligations I am under to the
gentlemen, and others who furnished me with information for this paper.
   Since writing the above, I have discovered, that there are many caves
on that part of the coast, belonging to Lord Findlater.  The most noted
are, 1st. Farskane's Cave, so called, from the proprietor of Farskane ha-
ving, in 1715, retired into it along with two other gentlemen, to avoid
trouble during the Earl of Mar's rebellion.  In it they lived very snugly
and comfortably for 5 or 6 weeks; and returned to their own housed,
when all apprehension of danger was over. 2. Janet Corstair's cave, so-
named, from a mad woman who took up her residence in it.  And 3-
   The Cross Cave, so denominated, from its taking a direction to the east
and west, at some distance from its entrance.  The extent of none of
them is known.
   There is a well of fresh water on the north side of a green hill, fur
rounded by the tide, called Priest's Crag-well, between Findochtie and
Portknockie.
   The fishers employ all kinds of small fish as bait for catching the great
fish.  And muscles are purchased at Tain for 15 s. 4 d.; Little Ferry, at
23 s.; and  at Findhorn, from 10 s. to 25 s. the boat load, as bait for the
small fish, in the winter-season, and limpets, crabs, and other shell fish,
worms dug out of the sand, called by the fishers lugs; and sandals, a spe-
cies of fish founf in the sand, are employed in June, July and August.
   Respecting the birds, migratory and indigenous, it may be proper just
to add, that of the former kind, we have plovers, cuckoos, rails, snipes,
etc. and of the latter, such as are common over all the north of Scotland.
