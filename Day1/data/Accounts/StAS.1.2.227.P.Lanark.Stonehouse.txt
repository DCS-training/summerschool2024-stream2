   Births.-It is impossible to ascertain the number of births:
though there is a register kept, yet it cannot be dependent up-
on.  Some of the antient Dissenters seem never to have regis-
tered their children at all.  Many of the Established Church
forget it.  Since the late duty was imposed, there are many
who refuge it.  Some on account of the expence, and some
from a mistaken notion of religion.  Some who know now reside in one
parish, register in another, because it happened to be their
former place of residence; and strangers sometimes register in
this, because their children, by some accident, have been bap-
tized in it.  As it stands, the average will be found to be 25
precisely, reckoning from the beginning of the register, which
was in 1696, till November 1790, there being 2275 baptisms
recorded.  No register appears for the years 1721, and 1722,
excepting 2 at the beginning of 1721, and 4 at the end of 1722,
which are not included in the above.  Multiplying 91, the
number of years, by 25, the number of children, the pro-
duct is 2275, precisely.

   Deaths.-It is difficult to ascertain the number of deaths
Of these there is no register kept.  The only thing, that can
throw any light upon it, is the account of the mortcloths.
