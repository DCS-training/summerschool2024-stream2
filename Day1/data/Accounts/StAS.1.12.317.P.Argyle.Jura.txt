     NUMBER XXV.

     PARISH OF JURA AND COLONSAY.

(COUNTY AND SYNOD OF ARGYLL, PRESBYTERY OF KINTYRE.)

     By the Rev. Mr. FRANCIS STEWART.

   This parish has the island of Ilay on the S., and that of
Mull on the N.; it is bounded on the W. by the At-
lantic, and on the E. by the Sea, which washes the coast of
Cregnish, of north and south Knapdale, and part of Kintyre.
Including sea, it is 50 miles long, and 30 broad.  It consists
of 9 islands, of which 6 are inhabited.  Colonsay and Oron-
say are separated by a narrow sound, which ebbs dry at low
water, and they form the western division of the parish.  A-
bout a league and a half to the E. lies the island of Jura.  At
the north end of Jura, are the island of Scarba, Lunga, Bal-
nahuaigh, the Garveileachan, and Eileachan-naomh.  As the
island of Jura forms by far the most considerable part of the
parish, we shall give it the first place in this account.
