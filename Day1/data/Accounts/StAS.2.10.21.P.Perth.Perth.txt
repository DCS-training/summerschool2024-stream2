of its humidity, either in the form of small rain or of a dense fog,
which, though minute in quantity, is sufficient, by the frequency
of the process, to affect the rain-guage.
   Winds.-The prevailing winds in the neighbourhood of Perth
blow from between the south-east and south-west, but most fre-
quently from the latter quarter, the most severe gales being ex-
perienced from the same point of the horizon. By taking the
means for a period of six years, viz. from the beginning of 1829 to
the end of 1834, the number of days which the wind blew from
the principal quarters of the compass was as subjoined.

Sky.-In every region of the globe, the face of the sky presents
an aspect which is intimately connected with geographical position,
and the character of the earth's surface, whether flat or mountain-
ous, over which it is spread. Thus in the equatorial zones, the
heavens are more serene, as well as more elevated in appearance, than
in the less gdnial climes belonging to the higher latitudes, in con-
sequence of the decrement of heat, in the atmosphere, being more
rapid as we advance from the equator towards the poles. Hence
the region of clouds becomes depressed in a corresponding degree;
especially in situations where the inequalities of the surface con-
tribute to intermix the different strata of the atmosphere, and to
produce that blending of vaporized air, upon which the formation
of clouds chiefly depends. Though Perth, as already noticed,
stands extremely low (being only a few feet above the level of the
ocean), and though it is closely surrounded on all side, except
towards the north, by hills, the flanks of which descend to the plain
on which the town is situated; yet these hills being of moderate
elevation, the hygrometric state of the incumbent atmosphere is
little affected by their vicinity, and the air is accordingly more dry
clear, than might have been expected. Fogs are not more
frequent than in the open plains; and the diseases resulting from
a damp soil, and a humid atmosphere, are of rate occurrence, or
rather altogether unknown. The gravelly and sandy subsoil of the
district, and the perpetual change of air occasioned by the current
of the river, in all states of the weather, contribute to render the
climate of Perth more salubrious, than that of many towns po-
