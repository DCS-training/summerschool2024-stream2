     of Snizort.

   The middle part of this parish, is let to principal tacksmen
and both the ends are possessed by a set of small tenantly.
The tacksmen till the ground with a home-made plough,
drawn by four horses; these ploughs, besides the ploughman
and driver, always require the attendance of one, and fre-
quently two men to lay over and dress the ground properly.
About two years ago, Mr M'Donald of Lindle introduced
Small's ploughs from the south country; their utility in the
great saving of labour in men and horses being soon observ-
ed, they were readily adopted by the principal farmers, not
only of this district, but also of the neighbouring ones; some
of the smallest tenants too use the common plough, for their
weak ground, in the latter end of spring; yet the chief in-
strument they use in cultivating the ground, is the crooked
spade.

   Population, etc.-Although there have formerly been some
emigrations from this, as well as from the adjacent parishes
and although that district of it, that is situated to the west of
the water of Snizort, and Loch Snizort, which was formerly
let to small tenants, is now in the hands of its different pro-
prietors; yet the population seems rather on the increase:
This I think, must be attributed chiefly to the introduction
of inoculation, which of late years, is practised with great
success.  When that malignant disease, in times past, visited
this country, which it then did not very frequently, its de-
predations were visibly felt, in sweeping away almost whole
families, leaving not above one, two, or sometimes three to-
gether in a house; but since inoculation, to which the lower
class of people have for some time been reconciled, became
general, it seldom proves mortal, and has really been so in
very few instances.  The number of souls at present in the
parish, is about 894 males, and 914 females; making 1808
