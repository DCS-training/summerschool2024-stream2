     Statistical Account

   It must be acknowledged, that the police of the town ad-
mits of great improvements indeed.  The streets are in a
most wretched state, though the inhabitants would cheer-
fully contribute to new-pave them, if a plan for that pur-
pose were set on foot.  As an inducement to them to assess
themselves for that purpose, the superior intends to allow
the customs of the public markets, to be applied for a limi-
ted time to that purpose.

   The want of a bridge across the river is a great inconve-
niency, both to the town and the surrounding county; but
without public aid, there is little prospect of getting that in-
conveniency removed.

   Two plans have been proposed for erecting a bridge over
this river; one of timber, and the other of stone.  The tim-
ber bridge was intended to be 363 feet long, and the esti-
mate of the expence was L. 211, 16 s.  A plan of the
stone bridge was drawn up by that excellent engineer, John
Rennie, Esq; of New Surrey Street, London, and the fol-
lowing was the estimate he drew up:
