normous gain, first tempts the indigent to convert their little
crop into a pernicious liquor, and then the law obliges them
to drink it themselves, as it cannot be sold but where they
have equal poverty and equal liberty.  Thus, in the trite
story, the two publicans, who went alternately to each others
houses, with the same twopence, drank both their cellars dry.
Were we allowed to export a part, to help us to pay our
meal and flour, it would do us much service.  We have,
however, much cause to be thankful for the present law, as

feeble virtue.  It has happily put an end to smuggling; and,
as we must have some liquor, it makes us drink our own,
and allows us to drink it better, than when it was made clan-
destinely and imperfectly.  The revenue too has been raised
since, by our collector, (Mr. Mackenzie), to full four times
what it was before the act took place; and the farmer gets
a better price, and better payment, for his grain.  Still,
however, it were much to be wished, that GOOD ALE*
was substituted in lieu of whisky, mad wheat and green crops
for the greater part of our bear.

   Manufactures.-It is some relief to turn from this unplea-
sant subject, to the dawn of manufactures among us.  For
there 2 or three years past, a number of young girls are pro-
fitably employed, in tambouring muslins sent from Glasgow,
and contribute to the support of themselves and parents.
About 50 weavers are also employed in working cotton-yarn
from the same place.  And yet our own linen yarn is ex-
ported, unwrought, to the value of near 2000 L per annum.
If, instead of this, we manufactured it ourselves, it would
