fortunate.  The failure of the scheme in his case, arose in a
great degree from the reduced and weakly state in which
the animals arrived in this country, from the accidental
length and storminess of the passage.  Several died during
the voyage, and most of those who came alive to land, sur-
vived for a few days only.  One, however, lived two years.
It was kept in general with the fallow deer in the park at
Atholl-House, but was also led, at times, to the summit of
the highest mountains in the neighbourhood, where the li-
chen, which forms the favourite food of the species in their
native regions, is found in plenty.  This lichen is the li-
chen rangiferinus of Linnaeus, or the rein deer liver-wort.

   Rabbits.-There is a rabbit warren in this parish.  It is
in a low sandy haugh, two miles to the westward of Dun-
keld, and has been let at L. 25 Sterling of rent.   On an
average, 125 dozen were killed by the tacksman yearly.
The skins may be valued at 6 s. a dozen, and the body sells
at the rate of 5 d. per pair.  To prevent the rabbits from
injuring the plantations near them, by stripping the bark in
a severe winter, branches of trees were lopped off and
thrown into the warren.  This precaution had the desired
effect.

   Hares abound here.  The lepus variabilis, as well as the
lepus timidus, is to be met with, though in general this spe-
cies prefers the tops of the highest mountains.

   The Ermine, (Mustela erminea), has been seen in this pa-
rish.  The fur is shorter than that of those skins brought
from Russia.
   Here, too, is the fox, badger, pine-martin, polecat, wea-
sel, otter, rat, mouse, mole, urchin, and bat.
