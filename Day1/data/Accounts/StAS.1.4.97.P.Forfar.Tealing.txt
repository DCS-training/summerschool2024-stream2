bable, by both there means, it is not necessary here to 
determine.  Indeed Mr S. is inclined to think that it ex-
cites a proper fermentation, and the softness which the 
soil thereby acquires and preserves for a considerable time 
after, together with some other circumstances, seems to fa-
vour the supposition.
   While the ground is under water, and even for some
days after it is laid dry, no cattle of any kind should be 
allowed to set foot on it.  The water should be withdrawn
rather gradually as otherwise, at least in a dry season,
the grafs will be a little apt to decay.  There is no stri-
king difference between the effects of water which runs 
from pools, or soft water of any kind, and those of hard
water immediatelty from the spring.  The former is, no 
doubt, preferable, but the latter will serve the purpose ve-
ry well; and this seems to be agreeable to the experiments 
of Dr Home.-Such is the mentioned of watering land,
which Mr S. has followed with great success for nearly the 
space of fifty years.  There is one inclosure of his which,
by this managements, was brought from an exhausted state 
into good heart, and preserved an uncommon degree of 
fertility for a succession of crops (one of them wheat) with-
out fallow, lime or marl, and with very moderate assistance 
from dung.
   With respect to the subject in general, it may be ob-
served, that water not only serves to enrich the land for 
future crops of corn, but also generally secures an early
and a large crop of grass the year in which it is applied,
a matter of considerable importance, especially in a dry and
backward spring. Perhaps the only inconveniecy at
tending it is its ecouraging weeds of a certain kind, such
as, thistles, ragweed, etc; but this appears to be fully ba-
lanced by the destruction it occations to weeds of another
