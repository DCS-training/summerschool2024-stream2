   Clover grass-seed was first sown in one of the burgh acres
about 60 years ago, and the people around run to see it as a
curiosity; nor did it become general in this neighbourhood
for upwards of 20 years after.
   The soil of the burgh acres is of a light nature, and of no
considerable depth, having in general a gravel bottom, and it
has been said a thousand times, that it and the ground a considera-
ble way round, would take a shower every day in the year
without prejudice; yet, being slanked by the range of Seed-
law-hills on the south, of the Grampians on the north, the
teeming clouds coming from the west with the prevailing sum-
mer-winds, often pass over and shed their fertilizing influence
on the hills on either side of this tract, while every thing in
the intermediate space was burning up.  The soil produces
excellent bailey, but the oat crops in general are light and pun-
ny.  The discovery of marle and the increased quantity of hot
manure from the town, has improved it very much of late,
and the multiplied consumption of the produce has so much
excited the industry and attention of the inhabitants, that most
of the old fields are in a state of high cultivation, while seve-
ral extensive ones improved from barren muir produce plenti-
ful crops.  It should be observed, however, that the tacksmen
of these acres are not in general able to pay the high rent
which many of them do, from the produce of the ground, but
one must have a cow for his family, and another a horse to car-
ry him to a distant market or bring goods from a sea-port, and
he takes a piece of ground near him and pays a premium for
his convenience*.
