consumed in the parish, many bolls are carried to Gree-
nock.
   From this method of farming, there are some exceptions
among the tenants; and especially 2 or 3 heritors, who do
the lands they hold in their own hands great justice, and
are well repaid.  Excepting what is done by these, agri-
culture is nearly in the same state it was 50 years ago.  Du-
ring many years, the farms have been increasing in extent,
as well as in value, consequently at present much dimi-
nished in number.  The number of acres in crop cannot
well be known.  If the season be favourable for ploughing,
the price of cattle, and the produce of the dairy low, more
is thrown into crop than when these are otherwise.  Crops,
in general, are but very moderate, as may readily be ex-
pected, from the manner of improving, and consist chiefly
of oats and a little barley.  Rye-grass has been introduced,
but is not much followed after.  The old Scots plough,
drawn by 3 horses, is mostly in use.  Ploughing commonly
begins about the middle of March, sowing the first week
of April, reaping the end of September, or beginning of
October.  The farmer generally holds his own plough,
where there are no children, or not grown up.  As the
tillage is not great, the produce is not nearly sufficient for
the inhabitants.  Though there are few farms, if any, in
the parish, that can he called store farms, yet there are 50
or 60 scores of sheep; almost one half of these are allowed
to range in the common moor, during summer, and come
down to the low grounds in winter.  If the price of lands
be a proof of value, here they fall nothing below those
systematically improven; when sold, which is seldom, they
bring from 40 to 50 years purchase.  The valued rent of
the parish is L. 3177 Scots.*
