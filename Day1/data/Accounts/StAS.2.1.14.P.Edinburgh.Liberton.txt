diate neighbourhood of the Pentland hills, on the farm of Morton
for example, the soil is generally a dry gravel, the rotation ob-
served on which is, 1. turnips or potatoes, 2. barley or wheat, 3.
grass, 4. oats.
   Rent, Produce, Manure, Servants' Wages, &c.- The rent of
land varies from L.3 to L. 7 an acre. A common rent is
L. 2, 2s. with a boll of wheat and a boll of barley an acre.
Grass lets at about L.5 an acre, although some of Sir Robert
Dick's parks, (which are supposed to have been enriched by the
shrewdness of one of his ancestors, who, being Provost of Edin-
burgh, turned a large portion of the waste sweepings of the town
upon his lands,) are let this year as high as L. 10 an acre. The
valued rent of the parish is L. 13, 685, 6s. 8d. Scotch; the real
rent in 1828 was L. 27,944, 3s. 2d. This includes rents of farms,
mines, houses, &c., the particulars of which I have in a statement
beside me. It also includes the rents of seventy-eight houses under
L. 2 a-year. This document was carefully drawn up by the late
schoolmaster after a strict investigation. Potatoes are the prin-
cipal crop in this parish. They are raised for the Edinburgh
market. The average number of acres bearing this crop annually
is 685, producing 23,124 bolls, or 34 bolls an acre. These are
sometimes sold on the ground at from L. 14 to L. 20 an acre. The
manure applied varies from 30 to 50 cart-loads at 5s. a cart-load,
the expense being about L. 12 an acre. The quality of the po-
tatoes is very superior. The cultivation and produce of other
crops is at an average as follows: 215 acres are devoted to tur-
nips, the produce being 5344 tons, or 25 tons an acre; 19 acres
to beans, the produce being 152 bolls, or 8 bolls an acre; 738
acres to wheat, the produce being 6416 bolls, or 8 1/2 bolls an acre;
490 acres to barley, the produce being 2990 bolls, or 6 bolls an
acre; 850 acres to oats, the produce being 8063 bolls, or 9 1/2 bolls
an acre; 1001 acres to grass, the produce being 132,340 stones
of hay, or 200 stones an acre. * This is sometimes let as green
crop at from L. 15 to L. 22 an acre. The manure applied to this
parish at an average is nearly 40,000 tons per annum. All kinds
of grain are of excellent quality, the weight of wheat being 62 lbs.
a bushel; barley 55 lbs.; oats 42 lbs. These statements are not
made at random, but are the result of a careful investigation made

<FOOTNOTE>These are of course the averages of the whole parish. Instances have been known
of single fields producing far larger crops. Potatoes have been known to grow at the
rate of 80 bolls, and sometimes even more an acre, and one farmer assured me that
from one acre he raised 19 bolls of oats or 132 bushels.
