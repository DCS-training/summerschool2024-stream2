more or less of a chalybeate nature; but they do not appear to
be so much impregnated, by any mineral substance, which could
in the least degree prove more efficacious in the cure of disease
than an other well in the neighbourhood; and the belief in those
supernatural qualities, with which superstition had invested them,
being dispelled, they have long ceased to be resorted to by invalids. *
	Parochial Registers.--These consist of minutes of the kirk ses-
sion, and of the records of marriages and baptisms. They com-
menced in 1736, and were regularly kept till 1780. From 1780
to 1807, the record of baptisms is somewhat defective. From
1736 to 1807, the date of the baptism is `lways entered; that of
the birth only occasionally. Since 1807, the date of both the
birth and baptism is recorded. The average number of marriages
for the last three years is 6; of baptisms for the same period,
22; of deaths, 7. The register of baptisms is not so complete
as it ought to have been, owing to Dissenters not choosing to en-
ter the births of their children in the parish register. The entries
are chiefly made by parents belonging to the Established Church.

<FOOTNOTE>In this parish of Bootle, about a mile from the kirk, towards the north, is a
well, called the Rumbling Well, frequented by a multitude of sick people for all
sorts of diseases, on the first Sunday of May, lying there the Saturday night, and
then drinking of it early in the morning. There is also another well, about a quar-
ter of a mile distant, towards the east. This well is made use of by the country
people when their caltell are troubled with a disease called by thel the connach.
This water they carry hn vessells to many parts, and wash their beasts with it, and
give it them to drink. It is, too, rememb'red that, at both the wells, they leave be-
hind them something by way of a thank-offering. At the first, they leave either mo-
ney or clothes; at the second, they leave the bands and shacles wherewith beasts are
usually bound."-Symson's Description of Galloway, page 16.
