In the village of Garvald there is also a baker and brewer.
In 1775, the period of the present incumbent's admission,
the number of souls was about 900.  This alteration hath
been produced by various causes, such as the conjunction
of farms, the ploughing with two horses without a driver,

farms greatly tends to depopulate the country, and to in-
crease the number of poor in towns and villages.
