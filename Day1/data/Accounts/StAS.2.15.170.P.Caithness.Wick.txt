              A Female School of Industry is supported at Stirkoke by Mrs
            Horne of Scouthel, where sewing is taught in all its branches.
              The school at Reiss, on which is dependent a large and poor
            district, ought to be endowed; and a school should be planted in
            the populous district of Hempriggs.
              It is impossible to state the fees in the various unendowed schools.
            It may be said, however, that, in general, they are very low.  In
            the Society's schools, the fees for reading are Is. 6d. a quarter.
            In the parish school, the fees per quarter are, for reading, 2s.; for
            reading and writing, 3s.; for reading, writing, and arithmetic, 4s.;
            with addition of geography, 4s. 6d.; and for all these with the
            classics, 6s.
              A great number of the children are very imperfectly educated.
            Many do not get to school above a quarter or two.  Poverty is
            partly the cause of this; but it must be confessed, that there is not
            so deep a conviction of the benefits of education as every Christ-
            ian must desire to see.
              Sabbath Schools.-- Of these there are, connected with the
            Church of Scotland, one in Wick, attended by about 250 scholars,
            and one in Pulteneytown, attended by about 320; and in the
            country, one at Keiss, one at Staxigoe, one at Reiss, one at Stir-
            koke, one at Thrumster, and one at Ulbster, which are attended by
            about the same number of scholars by which the schools at each of
            these places are attended during the week.  Sabbath schools are
            also kept by several of the Dissenting bodies.
              Literature.--At Wick there is a library, containing about 1620
            volumes.  It was instituted in March 1826, and is the property of
            the subscribers.
              There are two reading-rooms, one at Pulteneytown, and the
            other at Wick; the former established in 1829, and the latter in
            I840.  Each of them receives about four daily London, and about
            the same number of provincial newspapers.
              The John o Groat Journal, published at Wick, commenced in
            February 1836, and has had a uniform weekly circulation, up to the
