lation of this parish prior to the former Statistical Account in
1794; but, if a conjecture might be formed regarding its state
from the number of births and marriages which were yearly entered
in the parish register about a century ago, the number of inhabit-
ants must have been at that time one-half greater than it is at
present. The principal reason assigned for this diminution, as
stated in the former Statistical Account, is the cessation of seve-
ral collieries at that time in activity, and the loss of the various
advantages connected with them.

                    In 1755, the population was 919
                       1793,	        	883
                       1811,                    921
                       1821,	        	966
                       1831,                   1143

   The increase betwixt 1821 and 1831 is to be attributed partly
to the improved state of agriculture in the parish, and partly to
the erection of a small harbour at the Cove, which, at the time
the last census was taken, was still unfinished; and, consequently,
several strangers (probably about thirty) are included in it who
have now left the parish. Of the population in 1831, the number
of males was 570; that of females, 573. The yearly average of
births for the last seven years is uncertain, from parents neglecting
to register their children. Of deaths there is no correct record
kept. Of marriages the yearly average for the above period is
10. Number of families, 227; of inhabited houses, 213; number
of houses uninhabited, or at present building, 8; of fatuous people
there are 4; of deaf and dumb, 2.

The number of families chiefly employed in agriculture is,                    123
chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, or handicrafts 52

   There are no resident heritors in the parish. The number of
proprietors of land is 16;-the lowest rental being L. 175; the
highest L. 1050.
   Character and Habits of the People.-The people, generally
speaking, are of a strong robust frame; for the most part cleanly
in their habits, houses, and dress; and seem, on the whole, to en-
joy in a very competent degree, the comforts and advantages of
society. The ordinary food of the peasantry at their meals is
oat-meal, milk, potatoes, and pork. Almost every family keeps a
pig, and few are so poor that they cannot at a time afford a little
mutton or beef. In general they appear to be contented with their
situation and circumstances. Both Smuggling and poaching in
game prevailed at one time, we have understood, to a great ex-
tent. Both, however, have been given up;-the latter, we trust,
