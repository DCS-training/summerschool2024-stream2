                From the foregoing report, it appears that the quantity of rain
              which fell at Greenock in the vear 1838 'was 35.60 inches.  In
              1836, according to Crichton's pluviometer, it was 41.89. In 1837,
              it was 32.39. In 18-38, it was 31.75. The average of these three
              yearsis35.34nearly.* This is greatly below the quantity which fills
              annually in Westmoreland and Cumberlandl and nearly eight inches
              below the annual amount at Manchester.  From the same report,
              it appears that the thermometer did not-stand lower than 240 in a
              winter of unusual severity, and that its highest degree in the same
              year was 75.  It is still more remarkable that, in the months of
              May and June, the thermometer ranged bdtween 50, and 70' and
              43'and7l'.  When it is considered that be year l838 is one of
              the most ungenial which has occurred for a long while, it must,
              we think, be admitted that the climate of Greenock will bear com-
              parison, in respect of mildness, with that ofalmost any other portion
              of the mainland in this part of Britain. From the vicinity ofthis
              ptrish to the high mountains in the Cowal district of Argyleshire,
              and to the Arran range, it may be expected that it should be vi-
              sited with more frequent showers than the inland parts of the island.
              But, on the whole, the atmosphere is far from being humid; the
              air in the landward portions of the parish is remarkably salubrious;
                Mr James Leitch, merchant in Greenock-1 has mentioned to the wrhter of this
              Ae"Unt the following important &,ct, proving the necessity of choosing an open and
              exposed position for the receiver ofa pluviometer.  A pluviometer, constructed by
              Crichton, was placed with its receiver on the roof of the Infirmary; another, con-
              structed byThom, was placed in the garden behind.  The one showed a tow, durip
