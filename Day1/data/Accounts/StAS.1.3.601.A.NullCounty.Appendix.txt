     DURRIS, p. 258.

   Erection.-This parish was formerly a parsonage, in the
presbytery of Fordoun, and diocese of Brechin.  As the mi-
nister found it, at all times, very  inconvenient, and in winter
often impossible, on account of the deep snow on the hills, to
attend the diets of presbytery, the General Assembly, there-
fore, in the year 1717, annexed Durris to the presbytery of
Aberdeen.

   Agriculture.-The Norfolk plough is used for faughing, or
ribbing the ground, and plowing light soil.  The drill and
wheel ploughs are used on the haugh; but the old Scotch
plough, with low stilts, is most in use.  The farmers con-
stantly employ hired servants; but most of them have sub-
tenants, who are bound to cut down their master's crops, cast
and lead his peats, and build his sauld dykes.  They are
usually allowed Saturday, in time of harvest, to reap their
own corn.

   Poor.-Mr Alexander Hogg, a native of this parish, died
at Turkenham, in the beginning of the year 1787, and be-
queathed to this parish 500 l. in old 4 per cent.  Bank annui-
ties reduced, to be applied to the following purposes:

   imo, To a charity schoolmaster, for instructing 10 poor
children, boys or girls, whose ages shall not be under 9 years.
