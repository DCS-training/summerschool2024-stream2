   Savings Bank.-In the year 1815, the judicious and benevolent
plan of the Rev. Dr Duncan of Ruthwell, by which labourers and
others may be enabled to lay up their small savings in security,
and to receive interest on them, was introduced in Aberdeen, and
the regulations under which the savings bank was established were,
that sums from 2s. to L. 5 should be taken in every Saturday be-
tween 9 and 10 o'clock; that interest at the rate of 5 per cent.
should be allowed on sums exceeding L. 1, (excluding, however,
any odd shillings and pence,) after they bad been deposited for one
month; that the bank should not hold more than L.30 from any one
depositor; and that the whole or any part of the deposit might be
withdrawn at any time on giving a week's notice.  Twenty-four
gentlemen undertook the office of directors, attending two at a time
for a month in rotation, to receive and give out the money; and at
first the necessary expenses were defrayed by subscriptions obtain-
ed among the inhabitants.  The surplus interests of the odd sums
on the accounts soon enabled the directors to carry on the esta-
blishment without a continuance of the subscriptions, and this was
further facilitated by a fortunate purchase of 3 per cents. made by
the directors a few years after, in consequence of which the auxili-
ary fund was at once increased to nearly L. 1200.
   In the infancy of the institution, it was greatly indebted to the li-
berality of the Aberdeen Banking Company, who for several years
allowed 5 per cent. interest on the sums lodged in that bank by
the savings bank.  Afterwards the rate of interest having been re-
duced generally, and the savings bank being fully established, and
its advantages sufficiently appreciated by those for whose benefit it
was intended, this favour became no longer necessary, and conse-
quently the rate of interest allowed to depositors has since then
fluctuated; at present it is 3 3/4 per cent., having been recently ad-
vanced from 3 1/2.  The funds of the bank are vested in bonds and
other heritable securities, and an idea may be formed of the benefits
arising from this institution, and the confidence reposed in it by the
labouring classes from the following table of the number of depositors,
and the amount of cash deposited with it since the year 1832:

   The only improper advantage which, as far as is known, has been
at anytime taken of this bank is, that occasionally societies have
deposited their funds with it, dividing them into small sums, which
have been deposited in the names of different individuals.  This the
