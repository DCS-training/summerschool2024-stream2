funds, are, 2 poor widows, with their young families, 3 in-
firm and aged persons, and 1 insane.  There were more till
of late.  They receive a large monthly allowance, and
none are permitted to go a-begging.  Before they are re-

years past, when they were more numerous, the session,

session record, that, about 70 years ago, the weekly collec-

contented with their condition.  They have a taste for
dress, and young women of the middle, and even of the
lower ranks would now blush to be seen in the blue cloaks,
red plaids, and plain caps, whichonly 20 years ago, adorn-
