revenues, appropriated to the relief of decayed member, widows,
and orphans immediately connected with it.
   These funds, during the year 1837, amounted to L.2622, which
were distributed according to rates fixed by each corporation in-
dependently of the others, among 154 superannuated members,
150 widows, (the same who received the benefit of the general
fund and of the widows' funds,) and 156 orphans.
   The following table will show the proportion of these funds, and
their objects appertaining to each trade:-

   Society of Advocates.-We find the practitioners of the law in
Aberdeen recognized by the title of " Advocati," as early as 1633,
and under that title they received a charter from the Crown in
1774, and again another of a more extensive nature in 1799, in
which they are styled, " the President and Society of Advocates
in Aberdeen."
   The chief object of the society is to maintain, by the contribu-
tions of its members, a fund for the purpose of giving allowances
to indigent members, and to the widows, orphans, and nearest re-
latives of deceased members.  This fund was instituted in 1685;
the allowances which they have been able to give from it have
been at different times augmented, but it is believed that they
have never yet found it necessary to diminish the rate.  At pre-
sent the annual allowance to a widow is about L.40.  The So-
ciety also possesses a valuable law-library, which is kept up by the
contributions of the members, and by fees from entrant appren-
tices.  This library is open to the free use of all the members of
the Society.  It contains about 1900 volumes, and was begun to
be collected in 1786.
   The Society has lately erected a spacious Hall for the purpose
of their meetings, with suitable accommodations for their library,
&c. in Union Street.
   Society of Shipmasters.-This association was formed in 1598,
and was chartered in 1600, with a right to levy a tax on all ship-
ping entering the port, but this right was annulled in 1784.  The
