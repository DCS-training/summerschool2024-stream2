that manufacture, it is hard to say what extent it might

   Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-The church was built in
1716; the manse in 1782.  The stipend is L. 80 in money,
2 chalders in meal, and 1 chalder of barkley.  The glebe is
12 acres of every good land.  The patron is Lord Binning.
There are 16 heritors, 4 of whom reside.-The salary of the 
schoolmaster is L. 16 Sterling.  Previous to the year 1735,
the poor seem to have been entirely supported by the Sun-
day collections and the contributions of charitable persons.
It appears, that in that year, the session admitted on their
rools as constant pentioners, 3 persons at 4 d. and 3 at 2 d. a-
week.  At that time the affairs of the poor were entirely
in the hands of the kirk-session, and continued so till about
1740.  It appears, that in 1737, the first demand was made
upon the heritors to give a regular assistance to support the
poor.  It was not, however, in general, punctually obeyed
on their part.  In 1741 the session requested that Justi-
ces of the Peace would call for the poor's list, and appoint
overfeers, etc. conform to an act of session 1. of part 1. of
Charles II.  This remonstrance seems to have had the de-
sired effects; for in 1742, it appears, that half the collection
was ordered to be given to the overseers for the poor.  The
weekly pay of the poor in 1743 was about 10 s.  Sterling.
From the year 1765, the heritors kept a regular minute-
book and a cash-book; their accounts after this being alto-
gether unconnected with the kirk-session records.  In May
1765, the number on the poor's roll was 22, in aid of whom
19 s. 1 d.  Sterling was the weekly assessment.  The highest
allowance was one shilling.  The quarterly assessment was
l. 13 Sterling.  In 1770 the quarterly assessment was
L. 18, and in 1774, it amounted to L. 25, besides L.4 levied
