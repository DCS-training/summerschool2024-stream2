amount to 310 L. a year.  The yarn is manufactured, at Mon-

into linen and diaper for the use of families, is not included.
This industrious spirit in both sexes is very commendable+.

   The religious character of the inhabitants of this parish is
moderate.  They neither run into the extreme of supersti-
tion, on the one hand, nor of fanaticism on the other.  In
truth, their religion is of the calm mild cast; and they make
no great noise or bustle about it, though they are very regu-
lar in attending its institutions.  The gentlemen of landed
property, 5 of whom reside in the parish, are of the Episcopal
communion; yet they very frequently, and almost regularly,
attend the Established Church, serting at once an example
both of piety and liberal sentiment, and increasing the poor's
funds by their voluntary offerings.  There are a few Seceders,
who join a meeting in the neighbouring parish of Benholm;
but their number is small; and they make little noise or dis-
turbance, except for REFORM, which, perhaps, as individuals,
they stand very much in need of.

as they have taken effect, the morals of the people have improved.
