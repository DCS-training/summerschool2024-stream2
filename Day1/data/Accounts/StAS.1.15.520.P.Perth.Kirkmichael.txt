the inner one being about 32 feet, and the outer about 45
or 46 feet in diameter; and all of them have a breach or

may be sunk a considerable way under the surface, from their
remaining so long in the same position; for a superstitious
regard is paid them by the people, none venturing to remove
them, though some of them are situated in the middle of corn
fields.

to be jealous of each other, and seem at times more anxious
to repel encroachments, than to improve their own posses-
sions.  The younger part of the people are showy in their
dress, but frugal in their diet.  Shooting matches, and rural
