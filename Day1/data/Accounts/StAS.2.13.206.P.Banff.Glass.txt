	of Cairnbarrow, to a Gordon, who, on that occasion, or on some
	similar warlike expedition, accompanied his chief with his seven
	sons; and when importuned by his noble leader to remain at
	home himself, on account of age, replied, that be would "head

	   Registers.-The registers of baptism, &c. reach no farther back
	than to 1750, and have been very irregularly kept till lately.
	   In several localities, more especially on the farms of Cairnmore,
	and Cairnbarrow, are large cairns, or barrows, composed of stones
	of ordinary size ; but there is no tradition regarding the time or
	purpose oi their erection, nor does it appear that they have been
	opened and examined.

	   Agriculture.-The number of arable acres is computed to be
	about 3600.  The extent of uncultivated surface can be ascer-

	pasture.  Almost the whole of the highest hills are undivided com-
