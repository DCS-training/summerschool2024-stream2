     PARISH OF WHITEBURN.

     (COUNTY AND PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW.-SYNOD
     OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDALE.)

     Written in 1793.

     Name.

   WHITEBURN, now commonly written and pronoun-
ced Whitburn, according to some, took its name
from a considerable number of families, of the name of
White, living along the side of a burn or rivulet, which runs
through great part of the parish; but more probably from
being near another of the name of Blackburn.

   Extent.-The parish is about 6 miles long, and, at an ave-
rage, between 2 and 3 broad.  It is bounded, on the east,
by Livingston; on the west by Shotts, and part of Cambus-
nethan; on the south, by West Calder; and on the north,
by Bathgate and Fart of Shotts.

   Situation and Surface.-This parish is in the county and
presbytery of Linlithgow, and synod of Lothian and Twee-
dale.  The soil is generally what may be called loam,
inclining to clay; and, in some places, having a mixture of
moss, with a strong clay or till bottom.
