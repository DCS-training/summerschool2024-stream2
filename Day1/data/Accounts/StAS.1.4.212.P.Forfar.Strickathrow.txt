veral years, and fells at the rate of 1 s. 10 d. the boll.  The
coal with which the lime is burnst, is imported at Montrose
from the frith of Forth; the usual price of that necessary
article is no less than 8 s. 6 d. the boll, or 72 stone, for
Scotch coal, and 1 s. 6 d. the barrel for English coal.  This
parish producing scarcely any peats, the fuel chiefly used
is turf and broom.-Stone abounds here, but it is of a red-
dish colour, and either very lost, or so hard as to resist the
chissel.-There are 2 mineral springs, impregnated with
steel, but too weak to produce any effect.

   Prices of Provisions and Labour.-In 1751, feed-oats
sold at 13 s. 4 d. and meal at 12 s. 4 d. the boll, butter at
4 d. the pound, eggs 2 d. the dozen, an ox at L. 2.  The
wages of men servants were L. 1: 13: 4, and of women
servants, L. 1 a-year, and a day-labourer got 2 d. a-day
and victuals.  In 1790, feed-oats and meal were sold, the
former at 15 s. and the latter at 13 s. 4 d. barley at 14 s.
and bear at 12 s. the boll, butter at 7 d. a-pound, eggs at
4 d. a dozen, an ox at L. 6.  The wages of men servants
have advanced to L. 7, and of women servants to L. 3 a-
year, and a day-labourer now has 9 d. and victuals.  A
girl that fits at her wheel will earn 6 1/2 d. a-day, at the
rate of 1 s. 1 d. the spindle.

   Population.  -According to Dr Webster's returns, about
the 1750, the numbers were 529.  In 1790, they were
672; 269 males, and 403 females.  The causes of this in-
crease are said to be improvements in agriculture, and the
extension of trade.  By the register for 10 years preceding
1790, the births were 143, the burials 120, and the mar-
riages 56.  But there is reason to think that the births and
marriages are not so fully intersested as the burials, many
choosing rather to forego the advantage of having their mar-
