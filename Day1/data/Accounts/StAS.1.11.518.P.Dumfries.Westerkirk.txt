<FOOTNOTE>

*This State of the population, in 1768, was taken by the late Mr. SCOT-
LAND during the course of his visitation.

+This man, according to his own account, is 106 years old, but his name is
not on the session record; the probability however is, all circumstances consider-
ed, that he is above 100.

++In the above list of professions, journeymen and apprentices are included,
and they all find sufficient employment in working for the inhabitants, except
the weaver, who sometimes make cloth for people who do not reside in the pa-
rish.
