	to the unfortunate Prince Charles Edward Stuart for some days.
	There is a cave in the rocks of Easter Main of considerable size.
	  Soil.-The soil in the parish is, generally speaking, thin and light.
	There is not much good land throughout the whole of it. The
	most of the soil is of a reddish colour and very hard. It is found
	to be very difficult to trench it, from the number of stones which
	it contains, and it requires a great quantity of lime and manure ere
	a good crop can be raised from it. The expense of taking in
	new land may be estimated at about L.12 per acre, but this in-
	cludes liming, clearing it of stones, &c. The expense of trenching
	it is generally about L.8 per acre. There is always some com-
	pensation given to the tenant, by the proprietor, for reclaimed land.
	The eastern or lower part of the parish is more fertile than the
	upper, where, owing to the mossy nature of the soil, the crops at
	an early stage of their growth acquire a purplish sickly appear-
	ance. This parish suffers much in a dry season, from the natural
	dryness of the soil, as well as from the small supply of moisture in
	the air. The average rent of arable land in the parish may be
	stated at L.1, 10s. per acre.
	  Zoology- The quadrupeds are such as are common to the neigh-
	bouring parishes. The hedgehog and squirrel have not yet reach-
	ed this	district. The cross-bill breeds in the pine forests, and re-
	mains during the whole year.-The fishes in the lakes and rivers are
	such as are common to this part of the country, and require no par-
	ticular enumeration.
	  Botany.-Plantsfound in the parish of Kiltarlity.-
