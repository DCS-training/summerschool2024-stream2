land.  In a few instances, some of the 12 penny land has
been measured, and was found to be 3/4 of an acre to each
merk, and 6 penny land 1/2 acre to each merk.  The rents of
the different quality of land is thus stated:  12 penny land
pays yearly 16 merks of butter, and L. 1:4:o Scots; 9 pen-
ny land pays yearly 12 merks of butter, and L. 1 Scots per
in.; 6 penny land pays yearly 8 merks of butter and 12 d.
per m.; each merk butter being commonly converted at 2 1/2 d.
It is to be observed, that what is paid for these lands has not
been raised, perhaps, since these islands were annexed to the
crown of Scotland.  Of late, however, the price of the but-
ter-rent, when not paid in kind, has been raised from 5 to 7,
8, and 9 s. a lispund.  Till a few years ago, it was consi-
dered as a standing regulation, that the butter part of the
land-rent should be converted at 5 s. a lispund; a lispund con-
tains 24 merks, equal to 32 lb. English; but the factor for
the superior thought proper to charge the current price for
the feu-duty butter; and many of the proprietors of the
country followed this example:  So that a merk of butter,
which weighs 1 1/4 lib.  English, is sometimes 3 d. 4 d. and 4 1/2 d.
instead of being fixed at the old conversion of 2 1/2 d. a merk,
which was the former regulation.  This the tenants consider
as a hardship, as few of them can pay their butter rents in
kind.

   What is called the rentalled land of the parish amounts
to 854 merks of land, about 600 acres.  Besides-this,
there are many outlets, or new improvements, which are
made by the proprietors, in order to find a settlement
for the young men who marry, and whom they cannot ac-
commodate with settlements on rentalled or improved 
lands.  It appears rather doubtful how far these outlets or
new inclosures have been for the real good of the island.
