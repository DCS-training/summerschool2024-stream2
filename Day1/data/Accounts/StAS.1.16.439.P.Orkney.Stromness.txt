     of Sandwick and Stromness.

of this village was small, and, as it depended on the resort
of shipping, it was uncertain: That the borough of Kirk-
wall enjoyed great advantages from its right to vote for a
member of Parliament; from being the seat of Justice:
That the revenues of the borough were great, from their
burgage-holdings, cess of houses, fiars, markets, and cu-
stoms; and, therefore, one sixth part of the whole burdens,
instead of one third part demanded, would be found a full
and equal proportion for the village of Stromness; which
sixth part of the whole they were willing to pay.  This
offer was rejected.  The matter was brought before the
Court of Session; and on the 17th February 1754, a deci-
sion was obtained, declaring, "There was no sufficient right
"in the borough of Kirkwall to asses the village of Strom-
"ness, but that the said village should be quit thereof, and
"free therefrom, in all time coming."  From this deci-
sion the magistrates of Kilkwall appealed to the High
Court of Parliament, and this cause was heard at the bar
of the House of Lords, the 16th January 1738, when the
decision of the Court of Session was affirmed.  By this deci-
sion the village of Stromness, and all the villages through-
out Scotland, became free and independent of the Royal
Boroughs.  Before this process, the trade of this village
was greatly cramped by its dependence on the borough of
Kirkwall, as well as during the process, by the expences in
suppporting it; which expence hurt the circumstances of
many of the small traders; and one of those who first sug-
gested it, and was most active in promoting it, (Alexander
Graham), was thereby rendered unable to carry on trade,
whose widow is still alive, and in reduced circumstances.
The present Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, (then
Mr Wedderburn), was counsel for the inhabitants of this
village, at the bar of the House of Peers.
