paffing through the whole length of the parish, its former
name was probably derived from that circumstance, since
Leinzie, may, by no very fanciful etymology, be considered
as a provincial corruption of the Latin term, Linea.  Its pre-
sent appellation, Kirkintilloch, or rather Caerpentilloch, is
said to signify, in the language of the antient inhabitants of
North Britain, "the end of a long tongue or promontary of
"rising ground," which is exactly descriptive of the situation
of the town, standing on the extremity of a ridge, advancing

first of these posts upon the east side, stands upon the top of the
Barr-hill; a situation so elevated, as to command a view of almost
the whole length of the wall, both east and west.  The fort is a
square area of 150 yards.  Some vaults belonging to it, have late-
ly been discovered.  These are still entire; and are coverted above
with flat bricks, and floored with a mixture of lime and black
and white gravel, resembling sand from the sea shore, very
unlike any that is now to be found in this neighbourhood.  The
next of these forts, proceeding westward, is situated three miles
distant, at the village of Auchindowie:  this appears an oblong
rectangular figure, extending 150 yards one way, and 70 another.
It is now almost defaced; one part of the area being now a corn-
field, while another is occupied by the houses of the village; and
the rest has been cut away in opening the canal between the Forth
and the Clyde.- Two miles onward, in the same direction, is
the fort of Peel; situate on a piece of rising ground, at the west-
ern end of the town of Kirkintilloch; oblong and rectagular,
90 yards in length, So in breadth; singular, in being situated on
the north side of the wall, whereas the others stand upon the
south side.  Stones, bearing inscriptions, have been dug up a-
mong the ruin of all these forts:  But the only words of these in-
scriptions, that could be read, were, LEGIO SECUNDA AUGUSTA FECIT.
