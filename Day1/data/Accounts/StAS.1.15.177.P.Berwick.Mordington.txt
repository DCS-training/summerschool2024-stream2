shipped at Berwick, and sent to London, Newcastle, and dif-
ferent parts of York-shire.  This parish also produces a much
greater quantity of grain, than is sufficient for the subsistence
of its inhabitants, which is either disposed of in Berwick,
where it generally meets with a ready market, or fold to
the millers in the neighbourhood, many of whom carry on a
great trade in meal, barley, etc.

   Turnip Husbandry.-The time of sowing and reaping the
different kinds of grain, is the same with that of most of
the other parishes in the lower part of Berwick-shire, with
the advantage of being as early as any of them.  Turnips,
are generally sown from the end of May to the beginning of
July.  Though they are sometimes sown in what is called
broad-cast, that is on ridges made up in the same manner as
those on which barley, oats, or any other grain are common-
ly sown; yet they are more frequently raised on drills, from
24 to 30 inches wide.  This latter method is preferred, on
account of its giving an opportunity for horse hoeing, and
thus occasioning less manual labour, and consequently less
expence in thinning and cleaning them.  When they are
brought to maturity, which is generally about the month of
October, they are made use of for feeding cattle and sheep;
either on the grounds on which they are raised, or on neigh-
bouring grass fields, into which they are carried; or they are
brought home for the purpose of feeding black cattle in
houses or shades.  On the light and dry soil, the feeding of
sheep on the ground where the turnips grow, is reckoned a
most valuable improvement, as the land, loose and friable;
both by nature and by the frequent plowing necessary for rais-
ing the turnips, attains, from the constant trampling of the
sheep, a substance and solidity which makes it highly fit for
