   Character.-The people in general are sober and indu-
strious, regular in their attendance upon public worship,
and apparently contented with their situations*.

*At a period when the abolition of the slave-trade has become the
subject of Parliamentary consideration, the following anecdote may not
be disagreeable, as being perhaps the first process of the kind that came
before the Court of Session:-A gentleman from the West Indies, re-
siding some time at Methil, a negro servant, whom he had brought with
him, embraced at that time the Christian religion, and was baptized in
the church of Wemyss, September 10 1769, by the name of David Spens.
Soon after this his master resolved to send him back to, and sell him as a
slave in the West Indies; but Spens getting information of it, imme-
diately left his master, and went to the house of a farmer in the parish.
The master then raised a process before the Court of Session against Spens
to return to his slavery, and against the farmer for advising him to desert,
and also for protecting him.  To defend Spens from the oppression of his
master, and to assist him in asserting, what they conceived, his just rights
and privileges as a British subject, the inhabitants of the parish readily
espoused his cause, and raised a considerable sum of money.  The cause
was enrolled January 1770.  Four lawyers were engaged; and on the
2d February, the cause was ably pled on both sides.  Memorials were
appointed to be given in for both parties; but soon after this the master
died, and the cause was dropt.  To the honour of the lawyers engaged,
for the defendant, viz. Messrs Crosbie, Al. Ferguson, Hay and Belsches,
Advocates, and Mr Walter Ferguson, writer, agent, none of them
would accept of a fee.
