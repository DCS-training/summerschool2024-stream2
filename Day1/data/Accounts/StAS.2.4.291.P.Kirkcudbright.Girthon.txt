			PARISH OF GIRTHON.

		PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY.

		     THE REV. GEORGE MURRAY, MINISTER.*

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--THE word Girthon (anciently written Girton) is of
Celtic origin, being an abbreviation of Girth-avon, the enclosure
or sanctuary (for the term Gir or Girth may bear either of these
two significations) on the river. It is supposed that a village,
with a sanctuary attached to it, existed in early times at the pas-
sage of the Fleet. The correctness of this derivation is rendered
the more probable from the circumstance, that the neighbouring
parish of Anwoth, which is divided from Girthon by the Fleet,
was originally Avonwaith, the course or channel of the river.
(Chalmers's Caledonia, Vol. iii. p. 339.) The term Avon, the
original name of the river, was afterwards changed by the
Anglo-Saxons (who had possession of Galloway for nearly 400
years previous to 820) to Fleot or Fleet,--a word of synony-
mous import.
	Boundaries, &c.--Girthon is bounded on the east by Borgue,
Twynholm, and Balmaghie; on the north, by Kells and Minni-
gaff; on the west, by Kirkmabreck and Anwoth; and on the
south, by the Irish Sea. Its length is 16 miles: its breadth va-
ries from 2 miles on the south, to 5 miles towards ihe north. The
number of imperial acres in the parish is 15,480.
	Topographical Appearances.--The physical appearance of the
parish is varied. About three-fourths of it is mountainous, bleak,
and heathy, with but few spots devoted to tillage, or capable of
producing corn. The remainder, chiefly on the south, though
undulating, is rich, fertile, and susceptible of raising the best
crops; but is chiefly occupied in grazing cattle.
	Hydrography.--There are several fresh water loohs in the pa-
rish, namely, Loch Greanoch, nearly three miles long, by an ave-
