   Present State of Agriculture-In these isles farming is in a
very rude state indeed.  The hand of art gives little assist-
tance to that nature.  Almost every farmer is a fisher, and
a kelp manufacturer.  The same man may be seen, in a Ju-
ly morning, carrying earth to his dunghill; in the forenoon,
catching fish in the sea; and, in the afternoon, burning kelp
on the shore.  Some of the poorest people dig their ground
with a bit of iron about 3 inches broad, fixed on the end of
a long stick.  Fallowing is sot used: there is no change of
seed: there is no proper rotation of crops.  Small bear or
big, and black oats, have been sown alternately on the same
field for several hundred years.  The seed-oats never enter
into a riddle, but are held up to the wind either in a man's
hands, or in a creel, called a cosie, made of straw.  The
bear seed is put through a riddle, but the small grains are
not separated from it with any degree of care.  Every far-
mer has a ridge of potatoes, which he plants with skill, and
weeds with great care; and he is abundantly repaid.  One
half of his farm is sown with oats, which being generally
full of weeds, gives a very poor return; the other half with
bear, which, being manured with plenty of rich farm dung,
or sea-weed, yields a tolerable crop.  The plough has two
stilts, and is drawn by four horses yoked in pairs.  Many of
the farmers use harrows with wooden teeth, which are drawn
not diagonally, but with the broad side foremost, by a rope
fixed in the middle of the harrow.  The plough, which is
so light that a man can lift it in his hand with ease, turns the
ground very imperfectly.  It requires all the ploughman's
strength to keep it in the ground.  And the force which he
