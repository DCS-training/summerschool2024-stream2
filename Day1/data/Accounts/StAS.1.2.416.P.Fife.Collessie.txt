said to signify the bottom, and lessie, a den; and the village, in-
deed, is situated at the bottom of a den.-It lies in the
presbytery of Cupar, and in the synod and country of Fife.
Its length is about 8 English miles, and its breadth about 5.
-The fouth side of the parish is remarkably flat; and there
is scarely a stone, great or small, to seen in it.  The
north-west side is somewhat hilly.  The arable part iws ex-
tremely fertile.  The air is in general healthy.  The most
prevailing distemper, 50 or 60 years ago, was the argue.  It
now visits us but seldom, since the late improvements by
