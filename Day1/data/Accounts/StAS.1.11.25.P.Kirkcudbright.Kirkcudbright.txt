deep fossee, is situated on the highest part of the farm, and
commands a most extensive prospect of the Solway Frith.  At
some distance below the camp, upon a marshy ground, there
is a large well, built of stones, in a circular form, which had
supplied the camp with water; for no water is to be found
where the camp stood.  It is all rocky ground.-In the farm
of Lochsergus there is a large artificial lake, with two small
islands in it.  One of these is called Palace Isle, the other
Stable Isle.  Both of them bear strong marks of ancient
fortification, and were unquestionably the seats or castles of
FERGUS, Lord of GALLOWAY.

   Castles, etc.-In the farm of Torrs there are vestiges of a
a strong battery, erected by King WILLIAM the III.,  when
his sleet was wind-bound in this bay, as he was going to raise
the siege of Londonderry.  Within the same farm there is a
remarkable cave, in the precipice on the sea shore.  From
the entrance to the farthest end it measures 60 feet, but the
height is unequal.  It is narrow at the mouth, then gradually
widens, rising in height to 12 feet or more; again it contracts,
and at the end of 60 feet terminates.  The door had been
originally built with stones, and had a lintel, which is now
fallen down, and buried under the rubbish.  The cave itself
is the work of nature.  From its sequestered situation, and
difficult access, amidst rocks and precipices, it appears to
have been a hiding place in ancient times.  It was not impro-
bably some Druidical care.-Adjoining to the burgh there is
the vestige of an old fortification, called in ancient writings
Castlemains, now Castkedykes*.  It is surrounded with a deep

on purpose to protect the entrance into the harbour.  JOHN BALLIOL having
