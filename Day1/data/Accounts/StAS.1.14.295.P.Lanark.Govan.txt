     Of Govan.

   Character and Disadvantages.-For industry and ac-
tivity, as was formerly remarked, the farmers here are
eminently distinguished.  The superior classes are social,
hospitable, liberal to their poor, and generally regular in
attending the ordinances of religion.  From a great part
of the operative people in the villages, 279 of whom are
weavers, temperance, it is much to be lamented, has not
obtained a place among the cardinal virtues.  There are
no Fewer than 22 ale, or rather whisky houses in the
parish; and had it not been taken from the excise offi-
cers books, it might be thought incredible, that when 
the cotton manufacture was in a flourishing state, 1500
gallons of whisky were consumed in the village of Go-

any sipposititious addition to the prejudice of the re-
venue, need surely not be made, even by the most uncha-
ritable.

been neglected in their education; that many of the
youth should be unacquainted with the principles of re-
ligion, and dissolute in their morals; and that licentious
cabal should too often usurp the place of peaceable and
sober deportment.
   Notice was formerly taken of the inconvenience to
which the village of Govan is subjected, with regard to
fuel; and it still farther deserves attention, that there is
no standard by which the weight and carriage of coals are

*If neighbouring justices were, at stated intervals, to hold regular courts
in so large villages, they might essentially promote the best interests of their
country.  They would be a terrace to evil doers, and a protection to all that
do well.
