     Statistical Account

at Hayfield, various kinds of wood; the larch, the beech,
the horse chefnut, the mountain ash, the lime and the plane,
are planted with taste, and grow with luxuriance and beauty.
The climate is not favourable for orchards.

   Exports and Imports.-The exports from the country are
cattle, wool, woollen yarn, tartans, plaiding and russet.  The
imports are, about 1000 bolls of meal, merchant goods and
cash.  Exclusive of what is retailed by hawkers, there is
sold, yearly, from one stationary shop in the parish, to the value
of 60 L. Sterling, of snuff and tobacco.  This is an expendi-
ture that merits reprehension.  Let the men, however, conti-
nue to do in this as they choose, but far be it from the fair
and respectable females of this vale, to disfigure their features,
and to destroy theft powers of song and sweet cadence, by a
habit so repugnant to every thing engaging and cleanly in wo-
man.  There is one licensed distillery in the parish; the effect
of which is the destruction of great quantities of grain,
that, in place of being converted into wholesome bread, pro-
duces only a deleterious spirit, ruinous to health, to industry,
and to morals.  If no spirits were distilled in the county, the
meal imported would be a trifle.  At an average, there is an
annual importation of 40 thousand bolls into the slure.

   Population and Longevity.-As no exact public registers
were kept, the ancient state of the population of the parish
cannot be ascertained with precision; but, it is the general
belief, that the population is not materially different from
what it was about 40 years ago.  This conjecture is confirm-
ed by the only investigation of the fact, that can now be made.
At present, (1792,) the total number is 169.  The return
to Dr Webster in 1755 was 1654, the difference is therefore
only 15.  Of these there are of males, 783, of females, 886.
