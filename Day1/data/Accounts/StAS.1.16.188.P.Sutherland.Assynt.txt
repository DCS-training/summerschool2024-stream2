these rains continue, and change to fleet and frost, which
sometimes happens, the whole labour of the year is either
lost, or, the crop is rendered unwholesome for man and
beast; of consequences sickness prevails among the people,
and the loss of cattle is inevitable.

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-In general, the climate is rainy,
as much so at least as in any tract of equal extent on the
W.N.W. coast of North Britain.  The rain continues not
only for hours, but often for days; nay, for weeks, especially
if the wind perseveres for so long a time to blow from the
west; if from that quarter it veers to the, its  conti-

*Harvest 1771 was favourable, the crop was good, and rarely got in.
A very great fall of snow took place in the beginning of January 1772,

all the provender had been given to the cattle, yet more than one third of
the live stock of this parish died.  Harvest 1782 was very bad; very little
of the crop was secured.  It was mostly lost, being covered with snow-
Spring 1783 was more favourable than that of 1772, consequently less loss
of cattle At this very time 12. September 24. 1793, the barley is not
put down, therefore a very late harvest is dreaded.
