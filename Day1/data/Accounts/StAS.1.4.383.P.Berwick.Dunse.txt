butter will be as good as from grass; besides, the spoiled
leaves may be given to young cattle, and nothing is lost.
Potatoes too are raised in great quantities, and the land for
them is let from L. 4 to L. 6 an acre; the proprietor of te-
nant only ploughs it, and the renter cleans them, digs them
up, and carries them home.  A great deal of grass-feeds
are fown annually, but little flax is raised, and no hemp.
Very great improvements are making in the breed of
sheep and black cattle.  In the S. part of the parish, the 
lands are let from 15 s. to L. 1 acre; in the N. part,
which is high ground, the land is not let by the acre, but
a cumulus rent is paid  for the whole farm.  Such has been
the spirit of improvement within these last 50 years, that
farms in the parish, which were let at L. 35. and L. 40, pay
now L. 210, and the tenanta doing well.  In no country of 
Great Britain is there a more respectable tenantry, than
there is at present in the country of Berwick; many of 
them rent from L. 500 to L. 1200 a-year; men well in-
formed in science, and most intelligent and industrious in
their profession; and in every 10 to 15 years, some of them
are purchasing property of L. 200, and even L. 500 a-year;
on which they enjoy, otium cum dignitate, the just reward
of their attention, labour, diligence, and good sense; and
all this under the great disadvantages, of being distant from
10 to 20 miles from lime and markets, and in a country
where victual is cheaper than in any country in Scotland.
There is plenty of marl, but lime, though distant, is con-
sidered as a cheaper manure.  The country of Berwick ex-
ports from the ports of Berwick and Eyemouth, above
80,000 bolls of victual, and fully the same quantity is car-
ried annually to the weekly markets of Edinburgh, Dal-
keith, Haddington, and Dunbar.  Land is fold from L. 30
to L. 80 an acre.  House are rented from 10 s. to L. 20.
Property does not often charge, either in lands or houses.
