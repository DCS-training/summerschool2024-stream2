Our object, now, is not to fortify our gates, but to render them ac-
cessible to all. Caerlaverock Castle will be found amply and faith-
fully described in many works. A pretty full account of it has
been lately given in the Picture of Dumfries by Mr M'Diarmid,
and formerly by Grose, Pennant, and others, to which the reader is
referred. This castle has stood several sieges; but to take notice
of all these would be inconsistent with the object of this work. We
find, according to Grose, that after the siege by Cromwell, the
castle bontained eighty-six beds, forty carpets, and a library worth
L. 200, which enables us to form some idea of its ancient splendour.
The fleurs-de-lis, conspicuous on the windows of the banqueting
hall, are a proof of the intimacy which formerly existed between
France and Scotland. In the reign of Edward I., Caerlaverock
sustained its most formidable siege. The whole army of that dis-
tinguished warrior was drawn out for two days against it before it
surrendered. The length of time was not remarkable ; but it is
worthy of being recorded, that the defendants were only sixty in
number. The discovery of this circumstance, it is said, occasion-
ed no small surprise among the troops of Edward.

				III.--POPULATION.
		In 1755 the population ofthe parish was                   784
		   1777 there were 449 males and 553 females, in all      902
    		   1791 there were 454 males and 501 females, in all      955
		   1811,                                                 1170
		   1821,                                                 1206
		   1831,                                                 1271
	The present population is about 1300. The increase is in a
great measure owing to the establishment of Glencaple quay, for
the accommodation of such vessels as cannot ascend higher up the
Nith. From this quay also, for several years, a steamer has run
to Liverpool:--the " Nithsdale," a splendid vessel, which com-
menced plying this season, accomplishes her voyage in one tide.
On sailing days, Glencaple is visited by upwards of thirty vehicles
filled with intending passengers and friends. There is also another
cause which probably has produced some increase in the popula-
tion. The extensive provision which is made for the poor, renders
it a desirable object for the labouring-classes from other parishes,
to acquire a residence in this.
