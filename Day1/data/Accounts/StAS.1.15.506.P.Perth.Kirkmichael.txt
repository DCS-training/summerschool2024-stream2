     NUMBER XXIV.

     PARISH of KIRKMICHAEL,

     (PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, COUNTY OF PERTH, SYNOD
     OF, PERTH AND STIRLING,)

     By the Rev. MR ALLAN STEWART.

     Name and Situation.

   THIS parish derives its name, like some others in Scotland,
from the church having been dedicated to St Michael.  It is
bounded by the parishes of Logierait and Mouline on the
West; of Braemar and Crathy on the North; of Glenshee
and Alyth on the East; and of Blairgowrie, Kinloch, Cluny,
and Caputh, on the South.  It comprehends the greater part
of Strathardle, the whole of Glenshee, and a district lying at
the lower extremity of that glen, on the West side of the ri-
river, called Black-water, which gives name to the county
through which it passes.  Strathardle is about 10 miles long,
and from 1 to 2 miles broad, and includes part of the parishes
of Mouline, Kirkmichael, Blairgowrie, Bendochy and Kinloch.
