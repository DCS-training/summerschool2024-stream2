many others which enter into touch more minute details. The
parts of the volume which appeared to me most interesting related
to the schools.  I have reason to believe that the state of educa-
tion in Perthshire was much better from the year 1640 to 1700,
than it was from 1640 to 1800." The remaining fragments are
from 1672 to 1682, and thereafter with many breaks and lost leaves
down to 1714, after which the record is continued with rather
more regularity down to the beginning of this century, when it be-
comes in all respects more regular and complete. The tdlpta-
tion to abstract the lost volume seems to have been the curious
elegance of the penmanship in which the entries are generally
made.
                           III.-POPULATION.
   The population has, during several years, remained nearly sta-
tionary. There are very few villages in the parish, and the
change in the agricultural system pursued by the landlords has
not been so great as to make any observable difference in the
number of the rural population.

<TABLE>
           The population of the parish in 1831 was                  3138
           Males,                                                    1483
           Females,                                                  1655
           The number of inhabited houses is,                         683
           Average number of persons in each family from           4 to 5
           The number of houses uninhabited or building,               32
           Population in 1841,:                                      2774

   There are 4 insane, 5 fatuous, 2 deaf and dumb, 2 blind.
       Yearly average of births during the last seven years; about     70
                      marriages when both parties are in the parish,    9
                                     the man only was in the parish,    5
                                     the woman only in the parish,      4
   There is no register of deaths, and it would be exceedingly fal-
lacious and unsafe to offer any conjecture on that subject from the
mere amount of mortcloth dues, on account of the number of pa-
rishioners, who bury in other parishes, and of extra-parochial per
sons, who bury here.  It is to be regretted that parents are care-
less in the extreme of the privileges and duty of registering the
names of their children.
   The language generally spoken is the Gaelic.  It cannot be
said to be getting into disuse as the language of the fireside among
the common people ; but it is falling into manifest decline as a
branch of school education.
