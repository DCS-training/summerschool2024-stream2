     NUMBER LXV.

     PARISH OF BONHILL.

     (County of Dumbarton.)

     By the Rev. Mr GORDON STEWART, Minister of that Parish.

     Name, Situation, Extent, etc.

   THE parish of Bonhill is situated in the county and
presbytery of Dumbarton.  It is 4 and one half miles in'
lenght, and about 4 miles in breadth, forming nearly a square,
The ancient mode of spelling the name of the parish was
Buneil, which, in the opinion of some judges of the Gaelic
language, means a botton or hollow.  Others imagine, that it
signifies the surgeon's residence, as the antient family of Len-
nox had a mansion house in the parish, and several places
derive their names from their servants and dependants.
Bonhil was erected into a parish by that family*.  The 
original district was very small, and, about the middle of
the last century, lands were disjoined from the parishes of
Luss and Kilmarnock, and annexed to that of Bonhill.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The time of its erection is mentioned either in Leith's His-
tory of the Bishops, or in Duncan Stewart's History of the
Stewarts, vol. 2d The three Tullicheum,  Stockragent, Ca-
meron, and lands of Balloch, Ledrestbeg, Bellagan, and Blur-
Hich, were disjoined from the parish of Kilmarnock.
