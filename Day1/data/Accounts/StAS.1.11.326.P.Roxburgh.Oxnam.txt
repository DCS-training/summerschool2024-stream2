     Statistical Account

   Cultivation-The upper part of the parish, towards the
English Border, is found healthy stock land, but very stormy;
the hills being high, and the valleys deep and narrow.  The
hills are mostly green and fertile, with an intermixture of
heath, moss, bent, ling, sprat, etc.; partly dry, and partly wet
and marshy.  The arable land, in this part of the parish, is
almost wholly laid into grass.  Towards the middle of the
parish they raise rather more corn; but their principal de-
pendence is upon stock.  The land is inferior in quality, but
not so stormy, as the Border hills.  On the lower end of the
parish, they depend more upon their crops than upon their
flocks.  Three small farms in this part of the parish keep no
sheep at present.

   Improvements.-The stock land has been much improved
of late, by draining the wet and marshy grounds; by plant-
ing clumps of firs, for stells to shelter the flocks in storm;
and by inclosing some part of the lands contiguous to the farm
houses, for hay to the sheep in severe winters and springs.
For a number of years, excellent crops of turnips have been
raised on the lower end of the parish, to which the soil, which
is dry and gravelly, is well adapted.  The lime used for these,
and for wheat, is brought, both from Tillside on the E., and
from Redwater on the S. A cart load, of 5 bolls, costs 12 s.;
and 5 loads are commonly spread upon an English acre.  The
general practice is to allow the sheep to eat them upon the
field.  Throughout the whole parish, potatoes are raised in such
quantities as to become the principal food of the lower ranks
of life for 8 months in the year.  They are also used in feeding
swine, horses, poultry, etc. and some are sold to the people on
