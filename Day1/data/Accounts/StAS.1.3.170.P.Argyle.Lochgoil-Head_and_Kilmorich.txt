ground, and to prepare it for pasture and tillage; but this
system was carried too far; Timber has become so scarce, and
so valuable, that in a considerable part of such a country as
this, the woods yield a greater profit than any thing else
which the lands can produce.  The natural woods, there-
fore, are now regularly cut, and preserved with care; and
there is a great number of trees planted yearly in different
places.  The natural woods consist of ash, alder, hazel, and
birch, but mostly oak; and there are several plantation,

lime.  The natural and planted timber in this parish, yields
the proprietors of the land about L. 500 Sterling yearly; if
the woods were cut down, the ground which they occupy,
even though perfectly cleared, would not pay the half of
that rent.

any exactness.  It is believed, however, that the proportion
of arable land to the rest of the parish, is as one to fifty.
There was more grain raised in this country formerly than
at present:  The inhabitants of old were in use to delve, or
dig the ground, a great way up the face of very steep hills,
and the ridges can be traced at this day; at present, there is
very little ground in tillage, but what is ploughed; and such
is the inattention of the people to agriculture, and so tena-
cious are they of old customs, that they continue to use the
strong heavy Scots plough, which requires two men and
four horses, though the ground, in general, is neither strong
nor stoney.  some of the tacksmen are beginning to use the
light English plough, by which they have the expence of a
