   Produce, etc.-The number of acres in the parish is
computed to be 21,885 Scots, or 27,747 English.
Not above the half of these are arable, the rest are moors
and hills; a few acres are planted with wood, chiefly fir, and
some ash and birch.  About a third of the arable ground
may be in turnip, potatoes, rye-grass and clover, flax and

account of the scarcity of stones, are made of earth, with
