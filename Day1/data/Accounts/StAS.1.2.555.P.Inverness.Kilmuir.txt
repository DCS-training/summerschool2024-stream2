or some other signal, notice was given of the approach of an
enemy, than used for the purposes of defense.  The Gaelic
language is principally spoken, more especially by the lower
ranks; but most of the names of places are derived from the
Danish or Norwegian.  Peat is the only fuel used here.

   The people of this country, and indeed of all the Western
Highlands, have signalized themselves, in the last, and in the
former wars, by their valour, and ability in bearing e-
very species of hardship and fatigue.  They are possessed of
vivacity and penetration in a high degree.  Their general size
is from 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet.  The greatest height, that
any has attained is 6 feet 4 inches.  There are no manufac-
tures, but of such coarse cloths and linens, as the country
people wear.  The inhabitants are very economical, indus-
trious, and humane.  In the seafaring line, they are not par-
ticularly active.  There is a small boat or two, in every farm
on the coast, for the purpose of fishing; but they are seldom
launched.  Crimes are rarely committed.  About 25 years
ago, a man was overtaken with a stolen sheep on his shoul-
der, by two neighbouring tenants.  The thief declared to
them, that this was his first trespass; and offered a reward,
if they would keep it a profound secret.  But they declined to
accept of the one, or to do the other.  The sheep was set at
liberty; and the poor wretch hung himself, next morning, to
the roof of his own house.

   There is not a single bridge in the parish.  In former times,
the roads were quite neglected, until within these few years,
when a great number of the principal persons in the district,
were made Justices of the Peace, who all unite, in seeing the
roads properly attended to; and their efforts are crowned
with success.  At first, they exacted the statute labour in kind;
but, finding that method not so efficacious, they commuted it
into money.
