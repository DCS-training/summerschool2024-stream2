Haddington, which gave consent to Queen Mary's marriage
with the Dauphin, and her education at the court of France.
   The parish church is a large and venerable structure; it
was formerly the church of the Franciscan monastery; from
the stile of architecture, it appears to have been built in the
12th, or 13th century.  Only the western part is used for
public worship; the remainder of the fabric is unroofed, and
going fast to ruin.  The patronage of this collegiate charge is
in the Earl of Hopetoun.-In the town is a very elegant cha-
pel, for those of the Episcopal communion, built A. D. 1765,
to which the present Earl of Wemyss was a very liberal sub-
scriber, having contributed in all about L. 400, nearly one
half of the expence of the building.
   Haddington has suffered frequently from fire, and from
the inundations of the Tyne, which in Octr. 4. 1775, rose 17
feet perpendicular, continued in this state several hours, and
then gradually subsided.  The mansion house of Clerkington,
and the beautiful Chinese bridge over the river were imme-
diately swept away.  The whole suburb of Nungate, and
more than half of the town were laid under water.  The in-
habitants were obliged to abandon their houses, and take
sanctuary in the fields.  Had it happened in the night time,
many must have perished; but happily no lives were lost.
This inundation was owing to the bursting of a water spout
on Lammer muir, for the day was not very rainy.

   Stipends.-The stipend of the 1st minister is 48 bolls of
wheat, 48 bolls of barley, and L. 41:15:5 d. Sterling of mo-
ney, including L. 8:6:8 d. for communion elements.  The
stipend of the second minister is 16 bolls of wheat, 32 bolls of
barley, and L. 50 Sterling of money.  Both ministers have
manses and glebes, but the first minister's glebe is but a very
small one, amounting only to three acres and a half.
