     Statistical Account

The most striking curiosities, however, are the Devil's Miln,
the Rumbling Bridge, and the Caldron Linn on the river
Dovan.
   1. The Devil's Miln.  The Devil's miln lies highest up the
river, and about an English mile below the present church of
Fossaway.  It is formed by the water falling over a small cas-
cade, into a cavity made in the rock below.  Here is heard all
that noise, peculiar to a great body of water falling upon a
miln-wheel, and driving it round with great velocity and force.
In the cavity below, the water is continually tossed round
with great violence, and constantly beating on the sides of
the rock.  From this it happens that a noise, similar to the
sound made by a going miln, is distinctly heard, when the
water has force enough, by its quantity, to beat the rock
violently; and when it is not so high, as to cover the cavity
altogether.  As this miln, according to the country phrase,
goes Sunday and Saturday, it is from this circumstance, cal-
led the Devil's miln.  Near this, and on the Muckart side of
the river, is something resembling a coal level, running into
the rock; which is called the Pigeons cave.  This, as the
access to it is difficult, has not been examined with so much
accuracy, as to ascertain whether it has been formed by na-
ture, or by art.
   2. The Rumbling Bridge.  About 350 yards below the Devil's
miln, stands the Rumbling bridge.  It is so called, from the
rumbling noise which the water makes; pushing along from
cascade to cascade, on the channel below.  The span of the
arch of this bridge, is 22 feet; its breadth 1 L, and its height 86.
Its height, however, from the surface of the water, varies accord-
ing to the swelling of the river, when the measurement is tak-
en.  When one sees the bridge itself, the high rocks all in view,
the natural wood with which in some places they are covered,
the water running along from one fall to another below, in
