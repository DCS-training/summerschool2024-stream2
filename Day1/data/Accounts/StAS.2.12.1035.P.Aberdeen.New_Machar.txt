books were selected with care, and, througb the children, not un-
frequently find their way into the hands of the parents.
	 Charitable and other Institutions.--A savings bank was establish-
ed in the parish in 1832. Amount of deposits up to June 5th
1841, was L.836; amount invested during year previous to that
date, L. 129; amount withdrawn during same period, L.62.
	 Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
receiving parochial aid is about 32; the average sum allotted to
each about L.2, 12s. annually. Besides the ordinary poor, as
many as five or six or more poor householders require occasional
relief. The yearly amount of church collections, on an average of
the last four years, is L. 58, 3s.; interest of poor's fund lent, do-
nations, legacies, and other casual supplies, L.26, 1s. In cases
of continual sickness or other domestic distress in a poor family,
it is no uncommon thing to raise a subscription for their relief.
This has been done oftener than once during the last year, and
very considerable sums have been raised. On the part of some,
that true feeling of independence is still manifested by a reluct-
ance to fall upon the poor's funds; but on the part of many,
little or no such feeling is exhibited; and the desire of parties,
once  received upon the fund, seems to be to get all they can,
      	Fairs.--It has been attempted, within the last few years, to es-
tablish a fair in the parish for the sale of cattle, but hitherto the
business transacted has been on a very limited scale.
       	Inns, Ale-houses, &c.--There are 3 inns in the parish, on the
line of turnpike road.
       	Fuel.--The fuel in general use is peat and turf, procured from
one or other of the mosses in the parish. But the use of coal is
rapidly on the increase; and though it has to be driven from Aber-
deen, it is in most cases now found to be nearly as economical.
