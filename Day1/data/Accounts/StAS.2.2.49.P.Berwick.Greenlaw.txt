               MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

   It is impossible to view the high lands in the northern division
of the parish, which extend to thousands of acres, without regret-
ting that they should have continued so long the almost exclusive
habitation of the moorfowl and the lapwing.  It is true that the
quality of the soil,-its altitude,-and its distance from lime and
markets,-preclude the idea of its amelioration by tillage, and by the
present improved system of agriculture; but were these bleak and
barren moors judiciously enclosed, drained and planted, they would
assume a new and improved aspect; in place of the heath and the
rein-deer lichen, we should have the fir and the oak, and what is
now a sterile waste, would soon become a leafy forest. The pro-
prietor would thus sow the seed of an ample and certain harvest,
for it is a well known fact that nothing tends more to enrich and
to fertilize than thriving and extended plantations. The high
would then rival the low lands in beauty and productiveness, and
every spot, even the most sterile, would ultimately become as
beautiful and fertile as it is possible for skill and industry to
make it.

<FOOTNOTE>quantities, are now supplied from the depot at a moderate price. Sir William made
the inhabitants a present of a weighing-machine, which has been of essential service
to them. Coals, which were formerly sold by the cart-load, are now sold by the
weight.
