   Extent, etc.-The length of the parish from S. to N. is
six miles, and it is three in breadth from E. to W.  It is sur-
rounded by the parishes of Lanark, Pettinain, Carnwath, and
Carluke.  The rising ground, already mentioned, divides it in-
to moor and dale lands, differing considerably in soil and
climate.  The upper or moor land part is a mixture of
clay and black earth, the dale or low land is a sharp sandy
soil.  Both divisions are of a good quality, and capable of
producing excellent crops, were farming more studied, and
the land properly cleaned and cultivated.  The great ob-
struction to improvement is the absurd custom of using turf
for fuel, which is altogether unnecessary here, as there is
great abundance of good coal to be had at a moderate dis-
tance.  Some of the tenants begin to open their eyes, and
to be sensible that the precious time consumed in digging,
winning, and leading home peats, would be much better
employed in improving the fields.  There is every reason
to think, that agriculture will soon be brought to a high
state of perfection, as there is no parish in Scotland where
the farmer has greater encouragement or more local advan-
tages, the leases in general being granted for the space of
fifty seven years, at a reasonable rate, and a ready market at
hand for every commodity.

   Patron, Church, etc.-Mr Fullerton of Carstairs is patron,
and principal heritor of the parish.  There are five other
heritors, two of whom besides the patron reside.  The va-
lued rent is L. 2150 Scots; what the real rent is, the present
incumbent has not had access to know, as he only became
minister of this parish on the 14th of August 1794.  He
