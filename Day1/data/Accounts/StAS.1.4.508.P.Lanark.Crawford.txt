vided during the winter, and in the summer, our store-
masters are employed in different way.  This gives our
fields an uncouth look, and even renders the crops later
than they would otherwise be.  This defect is in some
measure supplied by the natural fertility of our lands.
   When the seasons are good, no ground in Clydesdale pro-
duces more plentifully; but even in the best years, the 
grain is small.  Oats and barley are the common, or only
crops.  Peas are sometimes tried, but seldon with success.
Potatoes and flax are cultivated for private use.  Few or
none take the trouble to lay down fields with grass-feeds,
or to sow turnip.-Heretofore, a great number of cows
were keeped on each farm; but sheep is now the grand
object of attention.  The best of them, that is, those come
to the age of 3 or 4 years, sell from 12 s. to 15 s. the
head.  The sheep reared here, are those with black faces
and black feet; consequently the wool is coarse, and has a
mixture of black.  The storemasters, however, look upon
the black faced sheep as most profitable on the whole.
They are strong, which fits them for enduring the colds of
winter, and they grow to a great size.  The wool sold
here about 9 years ago from 1 s. 6 d, to 2 s. 6 d. the stone.
None of it is now sold for less than 5 s.  Part of it goes
to England by land-carriage, and part of it is shipped at
Leith.  It is not the custom to wash the sheep before they
are shorn.  The farmers are appredhensive lest the putting
of them into the water should prevent their fattening.
A little more attention, however, begins to be shewn to
the wool, in consequence of the rise of the price.  I should
take the average price of a sheep's grass to be at present
2 s. or nearly so.-There is not a more active or intelli-
gent set in this country than our storemasters.-The pre-
sent rent of the parish is L. 3400.  The farmers say, that
the rents are too high, and that if there happen any fall
