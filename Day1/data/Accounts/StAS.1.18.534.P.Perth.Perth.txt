subjects.
   A gentleman in Dundee, some years ago, wrote to his cor-
respondent in Perth, that if it were agreeable, an Unitarian

Perth, to give a sermon and an explanation of his principles.
The Perth gentleman very properly replied, there were al-

any more.
   It may seem a matter of surprise, that the established
church at Perth, should maintain its ground among so many
dissenters.  I am told there is not a vacant seat to be let in the

part of the galleries.  The number of communicants conside-

are seated.  And there are, besides to be provided for, all
the young persons, and a great number of others who do not
communicate.  It is surely therefore of importances even in a

diction of the church, should be provided.

ry, has prevailed much in France, and which was adopted by
some writers in our own country, the effects of which, now
appear, has made few or no converts in Perth.  The people
in Perth have been accustomed to the evangelical doctrines
explained in the particular standards of our church, and they
generally delight in them as affording them the truer happi-

alters from these salutary truths, there will ensue all manner
of licentious conduct.
   I have conversed with some, who evidently had been hurt
by reading the visionary and irreligious writings of Thomas
Payne.  One of hem told tries he thought no reply had been
