been frequently ploughed, when the farmer was in use to
turn all his fields into corn.  Seldom, however, did the increase
repay the labour; on which account, both from then situation,
and the difficulty of access, even though manure could be pro-
cured, the greater part of there grounds is turned into
pasture.
   A gentleman in the neighbourhood, Walter Ewing Maclae,
Esq. of Cathkin, who enjoys a considerable estate in this
parish, has of late paid much attention to the melioration of
his property.  He has inclosed at no small expence, the whole
of his higher grounds, with what are called Galloway dykes,
of five feet and an half high.  He has in this manner inclosed
upwards of 350 acres, subdividing the whole into parks of a
square and oblong form, of 30, 40, and 50 acres each, as suits
the nature and appearance of the grounds.  His exertions
have already been so far crowned with success, that for lands
which formerly let for 2 shillings, or 2 s. 6 d. per acre, and
were thus rated by those who enjoyed the lease, he now re-
ceives 15 shillings per acre.  Nor would he give a lease of
19 years at this rate.  The reason, why such a rise has taken
place, is, that these grounds not only afford excellent pastu-
rage, according to the use to which they are put, but may be
considered as so many temporary folds for sheep brought from
a distance, and intended as a ready supply for the Glasgow
market.
   The same gentleman is also engaged in subdividing, and
improving his lower grounds.  What he holds in his own posses-

servants and labourers from those parts of the country
where agriculture is better understood, and also by driving
manure from the city of Glasgow, these lands being only a-
bout 4 1/2 miles distant.  For such of the grounds as he is about,
to let, he demands so much per acre, 40 s. for some parts of
