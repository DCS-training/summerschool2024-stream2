     Statistical Account

Kettins, and upwards of a mile N. W. of the church, there
are still visible the outlines of a camp, supposed to be Ro-
man, as noticed in the account of Coupar.  At Baldowrie
there is an erect Danish monument, 6 feet high.  It contains
some figures, but they are almost entirely defaced.-The
Castle of Dores stood on the summit of the hill*, south
from Pitcur.  Tradition reports it to have been some time
the residence of MACBETH.  The following names are
doubtless of Celtic derivation: Baldowrie, Baldinnie, Balunie,
Balgove, and Airdlair.

<FOOTNOTE>

*On this hill, great quantities of ashes are said to have been
discovered.  From this circumstance, it is concluded to have
been one of those hills, where fires used to be kindled in antient
times, to alarm the country on the approach of an enemy.  On
the east quarter of this hill, and closely by the side of the new
road, the workmen quarrying stones came upon an excavation
in the solid rock, in which they found some half consumed
bones of a soft consistence.  The hole was about 3 feet wide
either way, and seemed to direct its course towards the south.
There was no entrance from above observcd, for at least half
a mile in any direction from this place.
