were always elders  in the parish, even during the most troublous
times; that the elders who collected, did thereafter during divine
worship visit the village of Colinton, and sometimes the more dis-
tant villages, to correct abuses: that the collections were good,
the poor on the funds few, and the money so abundant, that some
of the heritors borrowed from the session to pay their proportion
of expenses in repairing the church, while they seem to have for-
gotten to repay: that in 1680, two silver cups to be used in the
communion were bought out of the session funds, the one inscrib-
ed, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion
of the blood of Christ? I am the vine, ye are the branches ;"
and the other, "This cup is the New Testament in my blood
which was shed for you. I am the Vine, &c.; "on both it is
stated that they belong to "the kirk-session of Collingtoune:"
that the kirk-session gave authority to erect seats in the area of
the church; that under date 12th September 1680, it is stated that
some parishioners, having been displeased with the erection of a
seat in the body of the church, though allowed by the kirk-session,
applied to that body to have the nuisance removed, but the ses-

the bishop and the Presbytery," (N.B. This is the only instance
where the bishop is alluded to in the records;) that there was no
meeting of kirk-session from January 1662 till March 1663, "'by
reason that all the kirk-sessions of the Church of Scotland were
discharged by a public declaration of the King's Majesty:" that
in 1679, the communion was delayed by reason of the troublous
times, the country being in confusion in consequence of the fight
of Bothwell Bridge: that in 1677, on a complaint, the kirk-ses-
Sion pass an act prohibiting the lending out of the communion
tables and forms for the use of penny weddings: that the sacra-
ment was not dispensed in the parish from 1688 till 1702, for
which no reason is assigned: and that during the whole of the
period included in these volumes there has been only one Presby-
terial visitation of the parish which took place on the 8th June
1714. The following notices are curious: 1680, February 8, A
woman is taken up on suspicion of having murdered her illegiti-
mate child, the matter is  enquired into: "There is one thing
(say the minutes) very observable in that business, that when the
mother laid her hand upon the child's nose there came a little
blood from it, which was seen by many present,"	This refers to
the superstitious idea which used to prevail, that a murdered body
