Picket Craig, is a cavern, from whence issues a clear rill,
which was made by a search for lead that was attended with
some success, an old smith having seen some some, silver that had
been extracted from it, but which was afterwards dropt.  The
little caves, on the steep summit of the Picket Craig, are so
deep, that a hare being pushed by the greyhounds, cours-
ing a few years ago, and having taken to one of them, was
got out, with the assistance of a terrier, with the greatest dif-
ficulty.  Over all these, fronting the south rises with an
arch the Carlop's Hill; the same bank however continues
behind one of the rocks, which is a projection from it to the
Esk, and the inclined plain above it at the bottom of the
hill, directly over the village, is called the Lead Flats.  Out
of the small district of country between this bank called Lead
Flats, and a smooth round hill betwixt and Linton, called Lead-
law Hill, all the silver is said to have been got, from the lead
found there, with which Mary of Guise, Queen Mary's mother,
paid her troops, during the turbulence of her Regency.  At
the foot of the Dean, eastward, before it contracts and deepens
into a glen, is a subterranean spring, called the Rumbling
Well, which appears near half a mile south, on the other side
of a lime quarry, where, in consequence of a dispute between
two of the workmen, about 12 years ago, a glove being put
into it, was carried all the way through, and came out at the
place first mentioned.  The stream belonging to the third
glen, that meets the last one at the Harbour Craig, in conse-
qence of the workings of the coal, although a much greater
body of water, likewise disappears, about a quarter of a mile
above that rock, and suddenly bursts out with a fall, almost
in front of one of its sides.  The lime-rock at the Rumbling
Well is of a dark grey colour, almost black, with a great
number of white shells, resembling skrew nails,
of different
sizes, through it; and is in such large blocks, and so solid,
