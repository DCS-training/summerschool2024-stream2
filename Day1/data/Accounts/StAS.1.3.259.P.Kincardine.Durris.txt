the top of mount Gower, called Red-Beard's Well, which is
reckoned good for stomachic complaints.  There is another
strongly impregnated with sulphur.  The taste of the water
is disagreeable; but it fits very light on the stomach.

   River.-The river Dee bounds the parish on the north.
It is not navigable, but at Aberdeen, by means of tides.
The salmon fishing on the Dee, for some years past, have
not been profitable; because the fish do not come up the
river in such numbers as formerly.  From the month of Ja-
nuary, till the middle of May, salmon sells at Aberdeen, at
6 d. per pound.  During the rest of the season, they are sold
at 3 d. per pound.  They are in perfection from the begin-
ning of January to the middle of September.

   Hills.-The hills in the parish are Hawk's Ness, Mount
Gower, Cragg-beg, Mom-dernel and Gairn Monearn.  The
most remarkable of these hills is Cairn Monearn; according
to Mr Garden's map of the county, it is 340 yards high.
It has a very large cairn of stones on the top of it.  All
these hills are covered with moss and heath.  There are a
good many rocks at the foot of Cragg-beg.  Among these
rocks is a cavern.  A road to Stonehaven, called the Stag-
road, is near this cave.  Robbers, headed by one Red-Beard,
are said formerly to have sheltered themselves in it; and to
have committed many depredations.  Red-Beard's Well re-
ceived its name from this robber.
