     Statistical Account

These are the only marketable grain produced in the parish.
Beef from 5 d. to 5 1/2 d. per pound, mutton 4 1/2 d. and 5 d.
veal 6 d. pork from 5 d. to 6 d.; lamb 4 d. and 5 1/2 d. butter
from 9 d. to 10 d. cheese from 4 s. a stone to 7 s. 6 d. ewe-
milk cheese when new 6 d. per pound, when old 9 d. fowls
from 9 d. to 12 d. chickens from 3 d. to 4 d. eggs per dozen
3 d. 4 d. and 5 d.  It is here proper to remark that provisi-
ons of all kinds have risen considerably of late, from the
vast increase of consumers.  This parish never did raise grain
sufficient to maintain its inhabitants even in its former state,
now it may be asserted, that even at a moderate computation,
its produce of grains, etc. is not equal to above one third of
the demand.

   Wages and Price of Labour.-Both of these too have had
a very considerable rise from the above cause, and the manu-
factures lately established.  Men servants receive from 8 L. to
12 L. yearly with victuals, women from 3 L. to 4 L.  Labourers
per day from 1 s. 2 d. to 1 s. 6 d. without victuals; mowers,
in hay time, 1 s. 3 d. with victuals; wrights, 2 s. without
victuals; masons, the same; taylors, from 10 d. to 1 s. with
victuals; shoemakers, weavers, etc. charge by the piece, but
their wages have risen in the same proportion.

   Manufactures.-There are two considerable manufactures
lately established here, that of iron and coal-tar.  The latter
now produces likewise a manufacture of lamp-black.  As the
former is yet in its infancy, an account cannot be given of it
so minute, at least, and particular, as if it were in a more
advanced and mature state.  Its first commencement was in
the year 1787, and the furnace began to blow in July 1789
The manufacture is not yet brought to the perfection intend-
ed, but is gradually advancing, and in a progressive state.
