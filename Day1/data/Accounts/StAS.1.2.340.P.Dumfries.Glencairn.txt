is patron; but has no land in the parish.-The present sti-
pend is L. 88:17:9 3/4 sterling, including 100 merks for com-
munion elements, all paid in money.  It is the same now that
it was about 60 or 70 years ago.  With the addition of the
manse and glebe, it may be worth about 100 guineas per
annum.
   There is an Antiburgher meeting-house near Minniehive;
but that sect seems rather on the decline.  There are likewise
a few Cameronians in the parish:  but neither of these, nor in-
deed both together, bear any proportion to those who at-
tend the Established Church.
   There are two public schools; the one for Latin, with a
legal salary of L. 8:6:8 sterling; the other for English, writ-
ing, and arithmetic, with a salary of L.4, by private dona-
tion.  These schools used to be kept at the church, and at
Minniehive, four years alternately at each, by order of the he-
ritors; but that rotation has not been observed for several
years past.

   Population and Villages.-This parish is supported to have
been, at least, as populous formerly, as at present; as there
are very many vestiges of houses and of cultivation, where, at
present, there are none; and many farms, of late years, have
been thrown into the hands of a few tenants, who often place
only a herd upon one or more of them, where they themselves
do not reside.  The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, was
1794 fouls.  There are now about 1400 persons above 7 or 8
years of age, and consequently about 1700 in all.-No ex-
act register of marriages, baptisms, or burial, having been
kept, it is impossible to give any authentic information re-
specting their increase or decrease since that period.
   A large addition, however, has been made to the village of
Minniehive, within these 20 or 30 years, by Mr Fergusson of
