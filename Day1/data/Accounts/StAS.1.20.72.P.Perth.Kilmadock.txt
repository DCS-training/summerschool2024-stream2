handsomely finished within.  The offices stand on each side,
with title-roofs, forming a rural square, at once pleasant,
warm, and hospitable.  Farm-houses of this construction
are now becoming general; yet, in many places, the houses
are no better than what they were 30 or 40 years ago;
cold, dark, sooty huts; scarcely a pane of glass to be seen;
roofs of thatch, rushes, heather, or broom; the cattle and
people entering at the same door; earthen floor; the
fire on the hearth-stone, and scarcely a vent or chimney.  It
is lamentable to behold the exalted character of the gene-
rous farmer degraded by such miserable habitations.
   But the error lies on the side of the masters.  If a te-
nant's lease is to last only 19 years, he either builds no fen-
ces or houses at all, or of such a nature as to last little
longer than the lease.  Indeed, if he acted otherwise, he
would be injuring himself.  In all transactions, at home or
abroad, every thing should be reduced to the test of calcu-
lation.  It is manifest injustice towards a tenant to take him
bound to erect dikes or houses that ought to last at least 100
years, and give him only a 19 years lease.  None but fools,
madmen, or poor ignorant tenants, shuddering before their
laird, would bind themselves so absurdly.  The tenant
ought neither to improve, plant, nor build, without pay-
ment.  Neither should he bestow manure, to last longer
than his lease, without a reasonable allowance at the issue.
All that the tenant, in justice to himself, ought to do, is, to
labour and use the land to the best advantage, so as not to
leave it worse or poorer than he received it.  With regard
to improving waste ground, and building dikes and houses,
the proprietor should pay the whole outlay, and charge the
tenant with a certain interest annually.  This plan was
practiced with the tenants of Cambuswallace some years
ago, and the example is fast spreading over the parish.
