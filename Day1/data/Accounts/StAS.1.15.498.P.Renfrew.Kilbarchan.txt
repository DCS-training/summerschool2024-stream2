   Eastern Division Fences.-The Eastern, or low part of the
parish, is mostly enclosed, in some places, with stone dykes,
but chiefly with hedge and ditch.  The thorns are either
planted in the face of the earth, thrown from the ditch, or
on the top.  Another practice prevails here, of building a
parapet of stone, about three or four feet high, on the edge
of their ditch, and then they either plant the thorns perpen-
dicular on the top, or stick them in the face of their wall,
drawing the best of the earth to the roots.  The last method
answers very well, and the hedge requires no palling, or
weeding.  These fences are either put up by the tenants,
who have acquired new leases, or by the landlords, when
they set the farms.  It were to be wished, they were at great-
er pains to clean the ditches, and take off water from the
roots of the thorns; and that sportsmen, and others, who go
through the fields, would take the trouble of going round by
a gate, and not cross a hedge, as trespasses of this kind have
produced many insufficient fences, after years of care be-
stowed upon them.

   Farms.-The medium size of farms here is from 40 to
60 acres.  There is one farm, occupied by Mr Roger, of
222 acres, all in excellent order.

   Rent.-Some spots are rented at from 50 to 60 s.; but
the medium rent is from 25 to 30 s. per acre It is thought,
by persons of experience, that were the lands out of lease,
they could bear an addition of 5 s. at an average.
   About 50 years ago, the usual rent of good land was a-
bout 5 s. per acre. 30 years ago, it rose to about 10 s. 20
years ago, it rose to about 20 s.  Yet the tenants are more
wealthy, and live much more comfortably now, than at any
former period.  There facts shew, that the rise of rent has
