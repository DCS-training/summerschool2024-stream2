   Character of the People.-The people, in general, are sober,
and very oeconomical; but averse to industry, never work-
ing but from necessity.  The rising generation are rather fond
of gay clothing, the manufacture of other countries, which
exhausts all their substance, and keeps them constantly poor.
There is no manufacture in the parish.  The people are ge-

soap, etc. would be saved.

from 100 l. to 2 l.; for the most part they are from 15 l. to

able, and no doubt many of the poorer sort must have died
from want, were it not for the timely supply of corn sent by
government to this country.  One remarkable circumstance
