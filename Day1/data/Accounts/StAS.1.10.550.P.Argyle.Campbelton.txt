hopes of their introducing a better mode of agriculture than
was practised in the country; but they have generally adopted,
rather than changed, the customs of the place.  His Grace
also employs a skilful improver, to give his best advice and
direction to the tenants, from which considerable benefit may
in time be expected.  At present, the forcing of more than a
due proportion of bear, without a proper rotation, or any re-

A plain proof of this is, that oats, at an average, give but 3 1/2
returns; so that a great part of what is sown must probably

in which the gentlemen of the east country would have had

only upon air and water.  The Highlands are already so
heavily taxed by their situation, soil, and climate, that they
need every possible indulgence from government.  Of pota-
toes, butter, cheese, and black cattle, we have in this parish
sufficient for our own use, and somewhat to spare to our
neighbours.  The surplus is sent to Clyde, with which we
have such regular and constant intercourse by packets, that
