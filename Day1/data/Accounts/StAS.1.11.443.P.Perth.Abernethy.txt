source of much agricultural improvement, as most of the
farmers have their lime brought by water, either from the
N.  of England, or the Earl of Elgin's lime kilns on the coast
of Fife.  It produces salmon and trout as the Tay.  The
salmon are of an excellent quality, fell at 6 d. and 7 d. per
lib. in the spring, and 4 d. during summer.  Few indeed are
sold in the neighbourhood.  They are chiefly sent to Perth,
and from thence to the English market.  Fishing upon the
Tay begins about the middle of April; upon the Earn,
when not frozen, about the beginning of February; it is given
over in both on the 15th of August.  There are two passage
boats on the Earn: one at Cary, which is seldom employed;
another at Ferryfield, upon the estate of Carpow: this place
being near the junction of the Earn and the Tay, the boat be-
longing to it is often employed, in carrying passengers over the
Tay to the Carse of Gowrie.  There are 20 boats from the
parish usually employed in fishing during the season; each
boat having 2 men, who are generally tradesmen or labourers
in the neighbourhood: they are allowed, for wages, 6 s. 6 d.
a week, with what trout they catch.  The Farg, a rivulet,
about an English mile and a half W. from Abernethy, a-
bounds with small trout.  Upon it there are one oil mill,
with 2 corn and 2 lint ditto belonging to this parish.-There
is another small rivulet, called the Ballo Burn, that runs by
Abernethy on the W. and supplies the inhabitants with wa-
ter; on it also there is a corn mill.

within these 40 years.
