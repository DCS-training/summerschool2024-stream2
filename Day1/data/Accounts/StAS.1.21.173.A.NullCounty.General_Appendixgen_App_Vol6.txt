     The Statistical Account.

   It was a remark often made, even by persons of some ob
servation, that by collecting together such a number of peo-
ple, Kincardine would be overstocked; and the consequence
would be their becoming a burthen on the parish: for as the
bulk of them were labourers not bred to any trade, and pos-
sessed of little stock, it was foreseen that, for some time, they
could not afford to confine themselves solely to the moss,
from which the return must be flow; but behoved, for im-

growing demand for hands in this country, that not only do
the whole of these people find employment whenever they

etc.; a sober, frugal, anti industrious people, who, inured to
hardships in their own country, are peculiarly qualified to en-
counter so arduous an undertaking.  From this circumstance,
too, arises a very happy consequence; that wearing a different
