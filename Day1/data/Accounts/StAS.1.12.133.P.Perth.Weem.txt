dious, and in some cases, a dangerous disorder.  No change 
in the way of living can account for this disorder being so
frequent.  In the cure of the pleurify, an uncommon me-
thod of cupping was anciently used in this country, as well
as in many other parts of the Highlands.  The part affected
was slightly scarified with a razor, in the from of a circle,
and the broad end of a large cow horn was applied over it,
and a piece being cut off the top, it was strongly sucked by
a person's mouth, by which means a considerable quantity of
blood was taken away, and often almost immediate relief was
procured.  Since the use of blisters and proper cupping ap-
paratus have been introduced; this awkward method is, in
most places, discontinued.  A few tertian, and many putrid
and nervous fevers are frequently brought from the Low
Country.  The tertians are easily cured; but the other kinds
of fever prove often infectious, spread over considerable dis-
tricts, and sometimes cut off a great many lives.

   Soil, Produce, etc.-The foil of this parish varies accord-
ing to the different parts of the country in which it is situat-
ed.  The accounts given of the soil in the parishes of Dull,
Fortingal, Kenmore, and Killin, apply respectively to the
parts of this parish that are interwoven with these.  The
number of ploughs in 70, most of them now drawn by 2
horses.  The number of carts is at least double that of ploughs,
as many keep a cart who do not yoke a horse in plough.
In the lower parts of the parish, 20 acres arable may be
reckoned a ploughgate; but in the higher parts, not above
7 or 8.  There are sowm annually in this parish, 500 bolls of
oats, Liolithgow measure, which yield, at an average, four-
fold; 195 bolls of barley, or rather bear, yielding about six-
fold; pease, 40 bolls, yielding three-fold; potatoes, 125 bolls,
yielding twelve-fold; and 15 hogsheads of flax seed, yielding
