permit them to get a schoolmaster settled by a comparative
trial, to teach in concert with another schoolmaster, settled
by Dr Anderson's trustees, who have the appointment of
several charity schools; that these two might form a kind
of academy for teaching English, Latin, Greek, writing,
arithmetic, and book-keeping, the elements of mathematics

clerk.  The whole of his emoluments, with school-dues
