     PARISH OF STOBO

     (Country of Tweeddale.)

     By the Rev. Mr Alexander Klr.

     Situation, Surface,etc.

   The parish of Stobo is situated in the country of Tweed-
dale, in the presbytery of Peebles, and synod of Lo-
thian and Tweeddale. It is about six miles long, and between
three and four miles broad.  One part of the parish, is
mountainous, and sit only for sheep pasture; another part of \
it is arable, and capable of cultivation.  Some of the hills
are green, but most of them are covered with health.

   Soil.-The soil of the arable land is various; some parts
are wet clay, interspersed with stones; when drained and
limed, they give good returns.  There is another part, ly-
ing on the side of the river Tweed, which is a mixture of
earth, clay, and land.  This land yields very good crops, al-
though it does not, in general, receive from the farmer that
justice, in point of improvement, which quality deserves,
owing to the inundation of the river Tweed, to which it is 
in many places exposed, and by which, in some parts, it is
over run with a considerable current.  This land is perculiarly
adapted for pasture. it produces a thick stool of natural grafs,
which is well adopted, either for fattening cattle, or for milk
