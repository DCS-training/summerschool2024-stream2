be well stocked with salmon; but since the erection of a dam
at Bothwell, for the use of a cotton mill, few get up, but in
high floods.  Some saint attempts have been made to get this
grievance redressed; but as yet they have been ineffectual.
   As this parish is not much encumbered with muirs, mosses
and mountains, it is mostly under the plough.  The soil,
however, is of very different qualities in the different regions
of the district, On the river Clyde, which may be called
the first and lowest region, the holm ground is of a free and
fertile nature, producing (as it is said here), "meal for
corn*," and sometimes more.  But on the banks rising be-
hind the holms, the ground is steep, and the soil a fine mel-
low clay, many yards deep; and is therefore, in general, co-
vered with woods and orchards.  As the ground rises to the
east, in what may be called the second region, the soil is of
a clay quality, with a hard bottom, requiring much labour
and culture to render it productive; but, when attended to,
it sufficiently repays the farmer's industry.  In the middle, or
third region, about the kirk, and the estates of Kirton and
Whitehall, the crofts are naturally rich and loamy, though
not far from the till.  But the more distant fields (the "out-
fields" as they are here called), though plowed sometimes to keep
them in proper pasture, are generally shallow and poor, with
a bad bottom, and very unproductive.  In the fourth and
fifth regions, the soil, even in the out-fields, becomes more
deep and earthy; yet, being in some degree mixed with moss,
and less favourably situated as to climate, it brings, at last,
much less meal into the granary, and less money into the poc-
ket of the farmer, who chooses to keep it under the
plough.
