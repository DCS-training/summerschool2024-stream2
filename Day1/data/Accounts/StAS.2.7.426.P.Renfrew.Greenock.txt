                 It does not appear to be necessary to mention particulary the
              erection of the Exchange Buildings, and Assembly Rooms ; of the
              Tontine ; i the News-room in Cathcart Square, and other public
              buildings of minor importance. In the news-room in Cathcart
              Square, there is a very well drawn portrait (a copy) of SirJohn
              Shaw, the founder of the commercial prosperity of Greenock.
              The Origin appears to have been drawn when he was very
              young.
                                             III.-POPULATION.
                 Mr Wilson* mentions that, according to a survey for the pur-
              pose of a general poll-tax in 1695, there were in all Greenock,
              867 families, which reckoning 41 1/2 for each family, made the po-
              pulation 1651.  The number of births registdred in 1700 was
              86.  Takin these two sources of information together, we may
              confidently conclude that the population of this parish, at the be-
              ginning of last century, was about 2000, and rather below than
              Above that number.
               A second census was taken in 1735, apparently with a view to
              the erection of a new parish ; and the following is the copy of a
              document affixed to one of the volumes of the records of the town

                   In the town of Greenock, above 8 years,             2433

                                                                     -----

                The population, therefore, of the whole parish had more than
              doubled in the first thirty-five years of the last century.
              Supposing the enumeration in 1735 to be correct, and we have
              no reason; for doubting its accuracy, the population must have de-
              creased duringthe next twenty years, for, according to the return
              to Dr Webster in 1755,1 it was as follows:
                                  In the old parish.                    1886
                                  In the new,                           972
                                                                       -----
                                  Total in both parishes               3858
