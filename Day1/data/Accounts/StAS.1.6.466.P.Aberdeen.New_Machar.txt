Straloch, lying N. from the church, is in the shire of Banss,
although surrounded by the county of Aberdeen.  About a
mile from the church, these lands are separated from the
rest of the parish, by the parishes of Udny and Fintray which
meet together.-The extent of the parish is about 9 miles in
length, and about 2 1/2 in breadth; part of it lies on each side of
the post road leading from Aberdeen to old Moldium.
   The general appearance of the country is pretty flat.  The

pers for some years past, have been putrid fevers and sore
throats; owing in all probability to frequent rains, and the
want of snow during the winter, to purify the air.
   There are four mineral springs.  The water of some of them
upon experiment, has been found to be of a good quality.
One of them is much used, and is found beneficial in scor-

   There is a beautiful lake called Bishop's Loch, antiently
Loch Goull; within it, the Bishops of Aberdeen had their
lodging, before the chantry was erected.  Upon a rising
ground within the loch, the remains of the building are still
to be seen.  At the west end, is part of a ditch where the
