     of Dundee.

   The Dispensary was established in 1782.  It is entirely sup-
ported by voluntary contributions, and has been of the great-
est use. The president and principal benefactor is Lord Doug-
las.  But the contributions of the remaining heritors, (a very
few excepted,) either to this or to any other charitable institu-
tions of the place, notwithstanding all the advantages they de-
rive from it, are hardly worth the mentioning.  To the Dis-
pensary, it is also now proposed to add an Infirmary; and the
liberal and numerous subscriptions already obtained, leave
little reason to doubt, that the purpose will soon be carried in-
to execution.

   General character.-The people of Dundee have been for
a long time entitled to the reputation of industry, regularity
and economy; and, notwithstanding the increase of their
wealth and numbers, a just claim to this reputation still con-
tinues.  As their wealth has been almost entirely the result
of great attention and industry, it is preserved by the same
virtues, and they are still strangers to extravagant and rui-
nous luxuries.  One instance of economy and ancient sim-
plicity of manners, will, in some parts of Britain, hardly meet
with credit; that, though we have many burghers, worth
from 5000 L. to 40,000 L. there are not in the whole town,
more than 9 male household servants; and of these, not one
belongs to any person, who can, with propriety, be said to be
engaged in trade.  This economy does by no means exclude
cheerful and frequent social intercourse, or abridge their real
comforts and recreations.  It does not even banish a liberal
hospitality; and instead of lessening their humanity and com-
passion for the miserable, the people of Dundee are inferior
to none in generous exertions and contributions, either for the
relief of particular distresses and misfortunes, or for the es-
tablishment and maintenance of public beneficent institutions.
