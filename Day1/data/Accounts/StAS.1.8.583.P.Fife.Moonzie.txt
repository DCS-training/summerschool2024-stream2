     NUMBER XXXVIII.

     PARISH OF MOONZIE.

     (County and Synod of Fife-Presbytery of Cupar.)

     By the Rev. Mr. ANDREW IRELAND, Minister.

     Name and Extent.

   THE origin of the name is unknown.  It is probably de-
rived from the Gaelic, the language which formerly
prevailed all over the peninsula of Fife.  There is a parish,
with almost the same name (Monzie), in the presbytery of
Auchterarder, where the names of places are also of Celtic
extraction.-Moonzie, in point of extent and population, is
perhaps the smallest parochial district in Scotland, and fur-
nishes very slender materials indeed, for statistical observation
and inquiry.  It is only 1 Scotch mile in length, and about
1 1/2 in breadth.  The number of acres is between 1,000 and
1,100.

   Surface, Soil, Produce, Cattle, etc.-A great part of the pa-
rish is hilly, and the rest is flat and low.  The soil is very thin,
but fertile.  In a wet summer, it produces very good crops, both
of corn and grass; but, in a dry season, all the hilly ground
is quite parched.-There are 17 ploughs in the parish.
The farmers, now, only put 2 horses to the plough, and 1
man both holds and drives.  This is a very great saving.  There
are about 34 or 36 horses in the parish; and a very few sheep,
