bleak and austere landscape lying within the sea-bound shores of a
country situated in this far northern latitude. The gradual swells
and inequalities of surface, including an endless succession of
heights. and hollows, are no doubt favourable for shelter, and we
accordingly find that, although some of the principal dwellings in
the parish are seen glittering in crested pride, and rearing their
proud battlements on the summit of what is occasionally a sunny
hill or eminence; yet by far the greater number court the lowly
shade or sheltered valley, more anxious to shun the hurricane of
the west, than to court the only occasional glimpses even of the
summer's sun. A few statistical facts in the shape of a journal,
kept by an aged man in the neighbourbood, now dead, will, how-

ther at different seasons of the year, than could be elicited by a more
general description, however well conceived or happily expressed.
