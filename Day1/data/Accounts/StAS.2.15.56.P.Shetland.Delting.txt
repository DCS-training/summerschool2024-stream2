                     PARISH OF DELTING.

            PRESBYTERY OF BURRAVOE, SYNOD OF SHETLAND.

               THE REV. JOHN PATON, MINISTER.*

            I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name, Situation, and Extent.-THE name seems to be of Danish
or Norwegian origin. The parish is bounded on the west by North-
maving, from which it is divided by a long narrow voe, called Sulom
Voe; on the east, by Nesting and Lunnasting; on the north, by
Yell Sound, which separates it from Yell; and on the south, by
Weesdale and Sandsting. It is difficult to state, with any degree
or precision, the length or breadth of this parish, as it is much inter-
sected by narrow voes, and no part of it is above two miles from
the sea. The appearance of the county is hilly, bleak, and barren.
  The air is moist, but not unhealthy.
  There are some small lakes or lochs in the parish, but nothing
deserving the name of river.
  Geology.-The prevailing rocks in this parish are gneiss and
syenite: subordinate are beds limestone and of hornblende rocks.

                    II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
  Parochial Registers.-There is a register of births and mar-
riages, and a record of the acts of the kirk-session. The latter
commences in 1709, and was regularly kept till 1719,-from which
time till 1751 there is a blank. From 1751, this record was again
regularly kept till 1781. Since 1821 the entries have been quite
regular. The register of marriages and births commences in 1751,
but was not properly kept till within the last twenty years.
  Land-owners.-Arthur Gifford of Busta; Captain C. Mowat of
Garth; Mrs William Mowat; Miss Hunter of Lunna; Repre-
sentatives of R. Hoseason; and William Angus of Toft. No
valuation ever existed in Shetland. Public charges are paid ac-
cording to an arbitrary arrangement of old standing, and peculiar
to this country.
