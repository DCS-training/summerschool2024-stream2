     Statistical Account

   Revenue, Imports, etc.-The public revenue of Stonehaven
consists chiefly of the shore dues, amounting annually to about
45 L., in which there has been a very great increase of late
years, from the great quantity of lime brought by sea, for
the improvement of lands in the neighbourhood.-Upon an
average of 3 years, 10,566 bolls yearly have been imported
from Sunderland and from the Frith of Forth, each boll be-
ing 128 Scotch pints.  The rest of the revenue arises from
4 fairs in the year, and some small patches of ground, pro-
ducing together about 20 L. more.  This sum, if properly ap-
plied, would do much to the improvement of the harbour:
But, till of late years, it has been levied to little account.
From this fund, however, the town has lately been provided
in excellent water, conveyed in leaden pipes; the streets put
in good repair; and a new steeple built, with a public clock.

   Fuel.-No lime-stone or coals have ever been discovered in
this neighbourhood; nor are there the least indications of
them.  The general fuel of Stonehaven, is coals, however,
which are brought partly from the Frith of Forth, and partly
from Newcastle and Sunderland: The Scotch coal at the
usual rate of 8 s. 6 d. per boll, of 72 stone; the English at 3 s.
for 24 stone avoirdupoise; of which the last are found cheapest
and most economical*.  But while coals are so heavily taxed,
the greatest bar is laid in the way of manufactures and im-
provement; which is here the more sensibly felt, as our neigh-
bours in Forsarshire, from a local exception, are free from
this obnoxious tax, no duty being paid, on Scotch coal, all
along the coast of Fife and Angus, till they are brought to
the borders of this county.  But it is with great pleasure we
understand, that government have it in view to grant us re-
lief in this necessary article.  Peats in this neighbourhood
