   Character of the People.-The farm-servants in East Lothian
enjoy the comforts of society in a greater degree than persons in
the same rank of life in any other part of the country. They are,
for the most part, allowed a cow's grass and potato land, and have
an opportunity of keeping a pig, and, in some instances, poultry,
which enables them to keep their families in a state of comfort su-
perior to that of most of the labouring classes elsewhere, and they
are in general quite contented with their situation and circumstances.
But work of all kinds is more difficult to be had than formerly,
which sometimes presses hard upon those who are employed upon
days' wages. They are in general exemplary in their moral cha-
racter, there being no instance within the memory of the writer
of this of any person connected with the parish having been con-
victed of any crime before the Justiciary Court. They are in
general attentive enough to the outward duties of religion, though
it must be confessed there is far less of the knowledge and the spirit
of it than is to be desired and is to be found in some other districts:
but there is no reason to mark any late declension in this respect;
perhaps rather, an improvement is gradually taking place.
