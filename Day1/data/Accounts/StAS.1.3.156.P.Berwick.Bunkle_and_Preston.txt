   Each ram will impregnate from five to six score of ewes.  It is
a certain fact, that no animal follows the properties of the
male so much as sheep; and therefore, the breeder is sel-
dom disappointed.  The highest breed also bear the finest
wool, though not always the greatest quantity.  Our farmers
pay as much attention to the breed of their sheep, as is paid
to the highest breed of galloping horses in England; and I
believe they bring much greater profit.

   Agriculture.-As soon as the crop is off the ground, and
sometimes before the shocks are removed, they begin to
plough.  They sow pease as early as the season will permit;
after that oats, and then barley; and lastly turnip, which
commonly begins in the last week of May, and finishes by
the first of July.  They begin to reap in the last week of
August, and generally finish in the first week of October.

   Marle and Lime.-There is a great quantity of clay marle
along the banks of the Whittater.  It was formerly used as
a manure to great advantage, and possessed at an average,
two-fifths of calcareous matter; but its operations are very
slow, though lasting.  The obligations in the tenants leases,
in regard to the rotation of crops, and the obligation of hav-
ing so great a quantity in grass, at least for the last 10 years
of a 21 year's lease, have induced the farmers to prefer lime
as a quick manure, though they are obliged to drive it 15
miles.  Marle for raising crops of corn will last six times
longer than lime.

   Poor.-The poor in this parish, as well as every other in
this county, are maintained by an assessment laid on by
the heritors themselves, according to their several valued
rents, one half of which is paid by the heritors, and the
