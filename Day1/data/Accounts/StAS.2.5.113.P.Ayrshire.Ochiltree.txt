   Manufactures.-In the villages there is a manufactory for making
reaping-hooks. Those made and finished by Hector Walker
are sent to different parts of the kingdom, and held in high re-
pute. There are box-makers, smiths, wrights, masons, shoe-
makers, tailors, coopers, a baker, customary weavers, and cotton-
weavers,-the latter class employed by the manufacturers of
Glasgow and Paisley. A considerable number of the young fe-
males in the village, and in some parts of the country, are employ-
ed in sewing muslin,-an employment which in most instances un-
fits them for other occupations, and, besides, it frequent injures
their health, and leaves them very helpless when they get houses
of their own, as to the management of their domestic concdrns.

			V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	There is no market held in the parish. The nearest market
town of any importance is Ayr, which is 11 1/2 mile distant from
the village. There are about 7 miles of turnpike roads in the pa-
rish, and 16 miles of other public roads, made and upheld by the
statute-labour converted into money, amounting annually to L. 75
a year. These funds are very judiciously applied in making and
repairing roads, through the different district of the parish.
  Ecclesiastical State.-The church stands in middle of the
village. It was built in 1789, and is capable of holding 900 per-
sons. It is divided amongst the heritors according to their respec-
tive valuations, and against amongst the tennants according to the size
of their farms. The families, in the village, though many sittings
are attached to their feus, complain, with great reason, of the want
