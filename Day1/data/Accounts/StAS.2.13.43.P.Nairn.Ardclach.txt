small slips,-lamps being unknown, and a tallow candle so rare,
as to be known only as "a white candle," in contradistinction to
the "fir candle," which they ordinarily used.
   This state of things now no longer exists. The people, though
many of them in poor circumstances, are, generally speaking, mo-
derately comfortable, and, many of them thriving, and rapidly ac-
quiring both increase of knowledge, and the means of independence.
They are becoming intelligent in their mode of farming, rearing
better crops, doing more justice to the land, and very many of
them inhabiting substantial and comfortable dwellings. The
causes which have contributed to this amelioration are various.
The country has been opened up of late years by the formation of
roads; encouragement has been given to the tenantry, and even
to the cottars; they have been taught, and have experienced, the
benefits of liming their land, and maintaining a proper rotation of
cropping,and the evils of the wretched system which tbey former-
ly pursued; farming societies are established in the neigbbouring
towns and villages at whose competitions they are encouraged to
attend; and premiums are given, partly by societies and partly by
the landlords, to the tenants and farm-servants, for good ploughing,
and to cottagers for the neatest and cleanliest cottages. With all
this, a great deal remains to be done; but, improvement having
once commenced, and the people being fairly alive to several of
the main causes of their improved condition, the prospect for the
future is sufficiently encouraging.
