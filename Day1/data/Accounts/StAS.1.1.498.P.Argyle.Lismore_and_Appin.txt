though it must be acknowledged that it costs nearly L. 70
Sterling yearly.  Numbers of carriers are employed monthly
between Appin, Benderloch, Oban, and Glasgow; and ves-
sels called packets run generally once a month between Green-
ock, Oban, and Mull, with goods of various sorts for the ac-
commodation of the neighbouring countries.  The post-of-
fice in Appin is at present kept by Mr John M'Laren school-
master, for a small salary of not more than about L. 5 Ster-
ling yearly.

   Massacre of Glenco.  It were to be wished that a veil could
be thrown over this part of our history, as it was the most bar-
barous transaction of modern times fanctioned by any regular
authority from government.  The massacre of Glenco hap-
pened in king William's reign, and is a circumstance well
known.  As it does not add much lustre to the humanity of
the times, it may suffice to observe, that all the inhabitants
who could be seized were indiscriminately butchered in cold
blood, mostly in their beds, by the soldiers and officers who
were their guests, and hospitable entertained for ten days be-
fore.  The officers were playing cards with Glenco and Mrs
McDonald the early part of the night:  Before  day, Glenco
was murdered in his wife's arms.  Mr McDonald of Achtri-
chatain shared the same fate.

   Public Houses.  In Kingerloch there are 2 public houses,
at the two ferries to Lismore and Appin, where they cannot
be wanted; in Appin there are 9 or 10; in Lismore 7 or 8.
These houses cannot be supposed to improve the morals of
the people; though, in a country situated as this is, a few of
them cannot be wanted.  Four or five of thofe in Appin are
slate houses, and pretty well kept; the others are but of a
very ordinary kind.
