  or fillet ; and neither male nor female had any other cover to
  screen them from sun or rain save their plaids, variously dyed and
  wrought. But now, most of the young men appear on public occa-
  sions dressed in West of England cloth, hats, stocks, or silk hand-
  kerchiefs; and while the matrons deck themselves in Merino and
  sombre-coloured cotton gowns, with straw and silk bonnets, the
  young unmarried females are gaudily dressed in fashionable prints,
  mousselines de laine, or silks, and caps with a profusion of gum-
  flowers, not unfrequently surmounted with Leghorn bonnets, having
  their full share of ribbon. At that time, the baneful and de-
  moralizing practice of smuggling was carried on in almost every
  hamlet throughout the parish. Now, these seminaries of im-
  piety and dissipation have almost all disappeared before the es-
  tablishment of legal distilleries, and the rigid observance of ex-
  cise laws. Then, many were the men who could neither write
  nor cypher, while none of the women could do so, and but few
  of these could perfectly read. Now, there is hardly a man
  under sixty years of age to be met with that is not ordhnarily
  versed in these branches of education, and mostly all the young
  females can both read and write, and not a few of them can cast
  accounts.
    But, great and manifest as these improvements are, others might
  still be effected with some trouble and expense. Ample as are
  the means of communication already enjoyed throughout the pa-

  greatly add thereto, and it were certainly desirable that those lo-
  cal and private interests which have hitherto opposed the erection
  thereof, would ere long give way to the far higher interests of the
  public necessity and welfare. The abolishing of servitude, still
  exacted by the proprietors from many of their tenants, in name of
  kain,-the building of more commodious and comfortable houses
  and steadings for the tenants, and neater cottages for the poor and
  labouring classes,-the planting of some of the knolls presently
  lying waste and irreclaimable, but more especially, the planting of
  a belt along the head dike which separates the hill from the lower
  ground, with larch or some other wood congenial to the climate
  and nature of the soil, would also tend mightily to add to the per-
  sonal domestic comforts of the people, as well as to the sheltered
  and ornate appearance of the parish,-while the repressing of
  unnecessary  ale-houses ; the encouragement of frugality and in
  dustry by means of subsidiary savings banks and friendly so-
