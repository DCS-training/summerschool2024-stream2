bread by fishing.  It is true, these boats sometimes go to
sea for the purpose of fishing cod, cooths, and tibrics, which
are the small or young cooths.  All the fish the people
take in this way are consumed in their own families; and
all the fish they can catch are but a small pittance for their
support.  Fishing on this coast would be a very precarious
business; there has scarcely been taken here, for years past,
fish of any kind.  The above boats are necessarily kept by
the people for passing ferries, and thereby transporting hi-
ther and thither whatever the inhabitants of these islands
have occasion for.

   Fishery, etc.-There is cod-fishing, though very incon-
siderable, both on the south and north side of Westray;
but the north sea is by far the best fishing ground, where, in
some particular seasons, there has been both cod and ling
taken, though not for years past, in any considerable quan-
tities.
   Cooths are a species of fish, which in this country they
call grey fish.  The proper season for taking these fish
commences about the middle of June, and continues till the
month of August, and sometimes longer, if the weather be
favourable.
   The time of fishing the young cooths or tibricks, begins
about the middle of August, and continues through the
winter, if the season is favourable.
   There is another species of fish caught here, called the
dog-fish, about the size of a middling cod, with a large
head; they are but a coarse kind of fish; what renders
them valuable is, that their livers yield a goodly quantity
of the very best oil.  The season for catching these fish is
the same with that of the cooths.
