     Extent and Surface.

   THE parish of Morton, lying on the E. side of the river
Nith, 15 miles N. W. from the town of Dumfries, is
about 6 miles in length, from S. W. to N. E. and 3 1/2 in

90 woods and plantations.  Along the banks of the Nith
and Cample, there are about 200 acres of good holm land.
