his extensive estate has become almost a garden: and how-
ever brilliant his service to his country has been, in raising
for Government two battalions of soldiers, his patriotism, in
improving so much waste land, is a more essential service,
and will continue when the brilliancy of his martial exploits
will be forgotten.

   Stanley-After passing Loncarty and Mr Graham's proper-
ty, we come next to the estate of Nairn, belonging to the
Duke of Athol, where the improvements are not less rapid
and worthy of notice.  The most remarkable object here is
the cotton mill of Stanley, which employs about 2000 spin-
dles; and besides this, there is now erecting a mill for spin-
ning flax; but as the site of both these are in the parish of
Aughtergavin, I shall only here take notice, that a small rivu-
let running through the village, divides the two parishes, and
when the whole plan is completed, there will be more than
the half of it in this, besides the whole of their present farm.
In that part of the village belonging to Redgorton, there are
at present about three hundred souls.
   As to the improvements of land, what is remarkable, is this
circumstance, that about three or four years ago, two thirds
were heath, and now they are fertile fields of corn, wheat,
and grass.  The two farms most improved, and which more
immediately catch the eye of the traveller, are those posses-
sed by Mr James Stobie, land-surveyer, and Mr Charles
Stewart, on each of which there are erected houses and offi-
ces in a tastey stile.
   Besides the public works already mentioned, there is one
corn mill, one oil ditto, one flour ditto, and one barley ditto,
belonging to Lord Methven, at the mills of Pitcairn.  In o-
ther places, there are two corn mills, belonging to Colonel
Graham.
