farm paid of rent in 1754, and for several years after, about
70 L.  One of the farms was let some years ago for above
200 L., and the other for 160 L.  Another estate, lying near
Arbroath, in detached parts, was sold about 43 years ago for
1750 L., several years after for 4750 L., and two years ago for
8000 L. in small parcels.  Another estate in the E. side of the
parish, was sold in 1765 for 850 L., and 2 years ago for
2000 L.

   Crops, Ploughs, Farmers.-There are about 70 farmers in
the parish, who pay of yearly rent from 2 L. to 200 L. Of 35
heritors, the number in 1754, only 2 are alive; and there is
not one farmer alive in the parish, and now possessed of a farm,
who was farmer in 1754.  Scots ploughs, very neatly made,
and covered with yetling, are the only kind used in this pa-
rish.  They are drawn by 2 horses, and worked by one man.
The writer does not know of a plough drawn by oxen in the 
parish.  In such variety of soil, difference of climate in the
E. and W. sides of the parish, degrees of knowledge and taste
of the farmers, power of habit, etc. the rotation of cropping
must be very different.  It is thought that the 2 following
modes are the most common here.  When a farmer breaks up
ley ground, which has not been formerly improved, about 30
bolls of lime-shells are laid upon the acre; the shells are deli-
vered with the barley measure, the first crop oats, the second
barley, without any manure, the 3 d crop oats, the 4th a green
crop, or, according to the condition of the ground, barley with
grass seeds, and lies under grass generally 4 years.  Or, they
break up ley generally at Lammas, lay on lime and dung for
wheat, 2 d crop oats, 3 d crop turnip, and 4th barley, with
grass-seeds.  There are raised here from 50 to 60 bolls or 16
stones Amsterdam weight of potatoes upon the acre, and of 
this useful root, great quantities are produced in the parish.
