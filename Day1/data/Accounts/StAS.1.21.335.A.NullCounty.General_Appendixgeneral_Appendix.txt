proposes, as a kind of augmentation, a very great increase on
the school fees, for the express end of preventing the poor
from attaining any acquirements, which might enable them
to rise above their former rank, or, as he is pleased to ex-
press it, which 'tends to derange that due subordination
'which ought ever to prevail in civil society.'
   He talks (pp. 257 & 260) of the 'industrious part of the
'community being loaded with a heavy burden,' and of
'a great body of the people being deprived of a considerable
'part of their property,' at the same time that, by his own
plan, he wishes to lay all the additional load on the most in-
dustrious, and least substantial, members of society.
   He seems (p, 256) much afraid of the introduction of

work must be better done in proportion to the smallness of
the wages, as the assistant 'will naturally be induced to ex-

'pressing wants may thus be supplied.'

opinion of human nature, are conspicuous, when he says,

lent,' and that 'the same care that is now bestowed for a
'schilling, could not then be commanded perhaps for a
'crown;' that 'the schools would become mere sinecures,
'to be given to the dependants of heritors or parsons;' or
that they should be taught by proxy, while the master 'put
'into his own pocket all the superfluous wages; and that
'those perfons would wink at the execution of the law, who
'should he entrusted with the enforcing of it.'
   The means, too, by which he proposes to rouse the indus-
try of the schoolmasters, and to preserve due subordination
in civil society, are such as few patriots, or even politicians,
