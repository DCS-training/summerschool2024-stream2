and another follow, dropping a seed or two into every scratch,
and then pressing it down with his foot as he goes along.
This seems to answer very well, and will, I think, save three
fourths of the usual expence of planting.
   `In digging a channel for the stream in the low grounds I
found the remains of many trees, chiefly aller and oak, lying
buried at the depth of 4 or 5 feet; but there was not a sin-
gle tree or shrub growing on the farm when I got possession.
On the very top of the high hill lying betwixt Middletown
and Altens, there is pretty convincing evidence that it has
been at some former period overflowed by the sea; as there
still remain several little mounts, composed of rounded peb-
bles, gravel and sands in pretty regular strata, such as still ap-
pear on the beach below.
   `Having now nearly completed my improvements on Mid-
dletown, I am proceeding to similar operations on the south
west parts of Tullos, which are in my own natural possession,
the rest being let to tenants on leases for 19 years.  And
here, I find, I have still a great deal to do in draining the
marshy parts and clearing the moor of stones.  I have, how-
ever, great encouragement to go on, as upon examining the
north face of the hill, which is at present covered with stones
and heath, I find the soil a very rich and pleasant one, being
mostly a yellow loam, with a mixture here and there of clay,
black muir soil and sand, very capable on the whole of culti-
vation: and I expect in 5 or 6 years hence to have in cultiva-
tion in that quarter 50 or 60 acres, worth 2 L. per acre, which
at my entry did not yield so many pence.
   `The only disadvantage, worth mentioning, which.  I find
in all these operations is the want of ready money adequate
to the extent of my fields, and my ardour for agricultural im-
provements: and I believe the same is the case with many
others in this country, though they do not choose to own it.
