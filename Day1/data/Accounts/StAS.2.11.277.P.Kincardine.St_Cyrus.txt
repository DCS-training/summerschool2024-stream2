	Botany.--Some notices of the botany of this parish, contributed,
among others, by the Rev. Mr Chrystall of Arbuthnott, are to be
found in Dr Murray's Northern Flora. In general, the native
vegetation of St Cyrus more resembles that of the parishes of
Montrose and Craig, situated directly to the south of it, than that
of the district of the Mearns, with which it is immediately connect-
ed, the soil and rocks having a nearer affinity to those of the for-
mer than of the latter; and, accordingly, not a few plants common
to this with the southern parishes, either entirely disappear, or
their distribution is much less extensive, on advancing a little
northward beyond the limits of this parish.  In the upland parts,
adjoining to Garvock, few or no plants are observed which seem
worthy of notice, except, perhaps, Menyanthes trifoliata, Parnassia
palustris, Trollius Europaeus, and Anagallis tenelia, which are, by
no means, uncommon in the neighborhood; but, in the more
shady dens, on the banks of the north Esk, and particularly along
the base and in the recesses of the cliffs of St Cyrus, where there
is a genial exposure to the south, the vegetation of native plants
is luxuriant and beautiful. Among these, may be enumerated the
following, which are found associated with the gray sandstone, but
chiefly with the trap formation:
	On moist or marshy ground,--Valeriana officinalis, Alisma
Plantago, several species of Epilobium, Aira aquatica, Aquilegia
vulgaris, with numerous Carices,among which may be specifiied C.
dioica, C. distans, C. intermedia, C. riparia, and C. pendula, the last
very sparingly in Den Fenella; and Lemna trisulca, of which no
specimen appears to have been met with  in -the north of Scoatland

<FOOTNOTE>Several speciemeus of which have been enough lately.
