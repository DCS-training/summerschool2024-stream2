to 8 d. The inhabitants of the parish are very healthy; agues
are less frequent than formerly, owing, I suppose, to their eat-

   There is a great store of lime stone on the Duke of Rox-
burgh's estate, and that of Hadden.  The laird of Hadden
has last year built a draw kiln for burning limestone, which
will be very profitable, worth, it is supposed, 300 l. or 400 l.

which has taken place since my settlement here, and which is
now very general, has been a great blessing to the inhabitants.
Every farmer almost allows his cottagers to set potatoes; and
many of them let some acres for that purpose at a very high
rent.  I let every year a part of my glebe to the inhabitants
