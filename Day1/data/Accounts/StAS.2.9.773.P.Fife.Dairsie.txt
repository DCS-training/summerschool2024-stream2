shaped windows in the Gothic style, and a belfry tower near it.
Now it is modernized by a roof of the modern shape, and the
steeple pointed as others.
   In the records of the synod of Fife, lately published for the
Abbotsford Club, we find that, in 1641, a report anent the church
of Dairsie was presented, when it appeared that the brethren and
ruling elders had been appointed to visit the church of Dairsie,
" anent superstitious monuments and kirk burial," who found
that, " at the entrie of sindrie desks upon the platform, and above
the great west door, there are crosiar staffes, being a sign of the de-
gree of the last prebend and bishops, as not hierarchical according
to the manner and form used among the Roman hierarchs, and
further found superstitious " a glorious partition wall, with a
degree ascending thereto." All these were denounced by the
provincial assembly, and the minister, and elders, and heritors
were ordained " to take order of the same," and this order was
several times renewed in after meetings. In 1645, in an assem-
bly held at Dunfermline, an order was made about " the levelling
of the queer in Dairsie Church."
   Within these few years, a vault was discovered in the east end
of the church, near the pulpit, and found to contain coffins and
bones, being used as a place of interment. It is understood that
this practice of burying in the inside of churches is in future to
be done away with, as prejudicial to the health of the sitters.
