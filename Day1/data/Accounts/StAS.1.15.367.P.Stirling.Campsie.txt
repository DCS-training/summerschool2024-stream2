year 1649, an augmentation of a chalder of meal, and one
hundred pounds Scots, was granted; and in the 1785, a new
augmention was granted; so that the stipend now is 80 L.
Sterling in money, two chalders of meal, and one chalder of
barley:  It would appear, that very soon after the act pas-
sed, ordaining glebes to the reformed clergy, that four acres
and a half of arable land was allocated to the minister of
Campsie:  In the year 1646, when a disjunction and annexa-
tion took place, three acres and a half more were allocated
for pasture; but, owing to the turbulence of the times which
followed, the minister never seems to have been in possession
of them; so that at present the glebe of Clampsie is deficient
in pasture; the Heritors, about 30 years ago, bought an acre of
land, adding it to the four acres and half, without specifying
whether it was in part of pasture or not.  Till lately, it was cus-
tomary for the minister to use some overt act to prevent pre-
scription running against him, anent the three acres and a
half which had been allocated for pasture.  For some time af-
ter the Reformation, it would appear that the clergyman had
lived in the vicar's house.  In 1627, a house was built alen-
atly for the purpose of lodging the minister; it was a small
house of two stories, thatched with straw:  In 1727, a new
house was built on the same site; which house, along with the
ocffies, was repaired in the year 1785, at the very moderate
expence of one hundred and twenty nine pounds.  The church

have therefore officiated in this parish since the Reformation, at least since the
year 1382; which, at an average, is nearly 16 years to each incumbent; but
what is very astonishing, out of that number no less than five were ejected on
account of the turbulence of the times, and one said to have been murdered;
facts, which should lead us to value the peaceable and happy times in which
we have.
