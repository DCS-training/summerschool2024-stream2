   About two thirds of the parish are inclosed, and trees ge-
nerally planted in hedge-rows along the inclosures.  There
are only two small hills in it.  All the healthy and una-
rable part of the Gnoc or largest, amounting to 222 acres,
is planted with sirs interspersed with larix, etc.  The
smallest, 500 yards distant, is all arable; the top of it, how-
ever, is also planted.  These, and the other plantations in
the parish, executed since 1770, may extend to 270 acres.
Ther is little old timber, except about a few gentlemens
feats; and only two coppices of oak and birch, which do
not together exceed 10 acres.  Before 1770, there were
a few small plantations of old sirs, which have since been
almost wholly cut down.

*Coals rose only in 1793, by the wet season, and want of other fuel.
