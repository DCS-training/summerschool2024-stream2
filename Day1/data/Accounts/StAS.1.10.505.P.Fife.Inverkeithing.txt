meetings they have ploughing matches; the competitors are
their servants, each man takes his ridge, When the work
is done, it is examined by proper judges, and a suitable pre-

ploughmen.  This practice has been attended with very be-

   Harbour, Shipping, and Ferry.-Before the entrance of the
harbour, there is a large and safe bay, which affords excel-

of war sometimes come from Leith roads, and ride at anchor
to avoid the winter storms; and merchant ships from the
Mediterranean formerly used to perform quarantine here.
The harbour itself is a small bay; at the mouth of which,
upon the west side, there lies a large Dutch built vessel as a
lazaretto, where, instead of detaining ships from foreign
ports, the particular goods, in which any infection may be
supposed to lodge, are immediately received, aired under the
inspection of a proper officer, and delivered, within a limited
time, to the owners, by the express orders of the custom-
house.  At the head of the bay is the quay, the proper place
for landing and receiving goods.  The depth of water at
spring tides is 13 and sometimes 15 feet.  It was deepened
within these few years; and a narrow channel cut farther
down to admit ships up to it.  This is kept pretty clear by
the rivulet that runs through it at low tide.  Another
quay is now building, with great improvements, to accomo-
date the shipping.  There are here sometimes between 40
and 50 vessels from, different places waiting for coals, espe-

place; but none of any considerable burden.  Some of them
sail to foreign ports, and the rest are chiefly employed in the
coal and coasting trade.  Between the North Ferry and Ro-
