and indeed not much inclined to industry, that they will
not easily be prevailed on to change them for the better;
especially if the alteration or amendment proposed be at-
tended with expence.  Therefore, with respect to improve-
ments in agriculture, they are still much in the same state as
they were 20 or 30 years ago.  Ploughs, on a new and
improved model, that in comparison to the advantages
derived from them, might be had at a moderate ex-
pence, have lately been introduced into several districts
around, where their good effects are manifest, in impro-
ving the crops and diminishing the labour of man and
beast; but the Laird of Raasay only, and one other gentle-
man in this parish, have yet used them.  The cascroim, a
crooked kind of spade, which being already well known,
requires no description here, is almost the only instrument
for labouring the ground used among the ordinary class of
tenants.  Where the soil is very wet, or the ground rug-
ged and steep, no agricultural tool can be used with greater
propriety and advantage than the cascroim; but, notwith-
standing, it employs, for the greatest part of the spring, at
least 2-5ths more labourers than would be necessary, if
ploughs were used where the nature of the ground would
admit.  Let it be hoped then, that this tiresome instrument
of vast unnecessary soil and labour, will be soon laid aside,
except in those places where the plough can be of no service.
Many hands would thereby be gained for improvements,
and other useful employments, to promote the public wel-
fare, and the state of agriculture would be greatly melio-
rated.  The most effectual way for obtaining this desirable
end, it is supposed, would be to distribute the farms capable
of being ploughed, into more equal and larger portions than
at present; for by this means, the mode now in practice of
dividing lands into small lots, in different proportions,
would be stopt; and every farmer, having always the same
field to manage, would naturally be more careful and
