in carts to the shore, and piled up in one heap.  When a
sufficient quantity has been collected, the people dig a little
square pit in the ground, at one end whereof they form, with
tough strong clay raised a foot above the surface, a bason 18
feet long, 3 in width, and 3 deep, which rises, from the
mouth of the little pit, in a gentle ascent to the further end;
the bottom of the bason is laid with square white coloured
peats, and above these, clean turf sods cut from the merse
with the green sides up, are placed, joined as close as possible
to one another and to the sides of the bason.  After thus
preparing the bason, a layer about a foot and a half thick,
taken from the heap of sand formerly laid up, is placed above
the sods, and sea water being poured upon it, filtrates through
the whole mass, and, when it comes to the lower end of the
bason, runs off by a small tube into the pit or reservoir.
When the saline particles of the sand in the bason are by this
means carried off, it is removed, and new land put in, which
is managed in the same manner.  The proper strength of
the liquor in the reservoir is ascertained by its carrying an
egg; and when this happens, it is boiled in lead or iron pans
until a residuum of dry salt remains, which is taken up in
wicker baskets; a liquid, something of the appearance of oil,
runs from it, which the people call salt droppings, and esteem
a good remedy for rheumatic complaints and sprains.  The
salt thus made is neither so white, nor so strong as that from
the salt pans.  A measure of it weighing about 24 lb. is sold
for a shilling; and, in consequence of an exemption or grant
by one of the kings of Scotland, no duty is paid for it; not-
withstanding which, the tenants on the shore who practice
this manufacture are supposed to be no considerable gainers.
