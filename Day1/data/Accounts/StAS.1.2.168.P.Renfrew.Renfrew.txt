     Statistical Account

though not near so many as formerly.  Two causes may be as-
signed for this:  The one is, the deepening of the river, when
the fish were disturbed in their course for so many years;-
the other is, the the public works which are now carried on in
the neighbourhood upon the river.

   Manufactures, etc.-The commerce of this town is very
inconsiderable, though, in regard to local situation, it is not
inferior to any place in the neighbourhood.  Indeed had it not
been for the fatal effects of borough-politics, it might, at this
time, have been one of the principal seats of manufactures in
the west of Scotland.  There is a soap and candle work, car-
ried on here, upon a pretty large scale; which, though lately e-
rected, is of considerable advantage to the place.  There is al-
so a small branch of the thread manufacture.  Four mills are
employed for this purpose; and each machine for twining the
thread, is supposed to require, on an average, 36 persons.
There is also a small bleachfield at the east end of the town,
which employs about 6 men, and 24 women.  The wages of
the men are from 7 s. 6 d. to 12 s per week; and those of the
women from 2 s 6 d. to 6 s. a week.  The number of looms in
the town, is from 117 to 120, partly for silk, but principally
for muslin, chiefly on account of the manufacturers of Pais-
ley.  These are the only branches of trade carried on here,
and all of them are of short standing.

   Climate, etc.-No place, perhaps, in the west of Scotland,
is so peculiarly healthy as Renfrew.  Epidemical distempers
are ever hardly known.  Two reasons may be assigned for this.
The one is, that the town stands upon a bed of sand, of great
depth, so that all the heavy rains, which fall here, are soon ab-
sorbed; and consequently, dangerous damps, and unwhole-
some fogs are hardly ever felt.  The other reason is the good.
