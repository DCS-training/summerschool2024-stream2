       weigh heavily upon some of them, still, from an anxiety to ward off
       the burden otherwise imposed by statutory law upon the tenants,
       they have hitherto confined the assessment solely to themselves.
       Nor is this the only instance of liberality deserving of notice rela-
       tive to the poor. Through the active sympathy and generosity of
       the Most Noble the Marchioness of Breadalbane and the Honour-
       able Lady Menzies, not a few of our poor on the Breadalbane and
       Menzies' estates are often both clad and fed. Willingly would
       the writer hereof say, if he could, that the poor show no disposition
       to ask parochial aid; but such is not the case.

       Inns.-There are five inns in the parish and six ale-houses. The
       former are indispensable for the accommodation of travellers, but
       the latter may with great propriety, be suppressed.
          Fuel.-The fuel of the common people consists almost wholly
       of peats ; but, along with these, the better classes burn a good
       deal of coal and white-wood, or oak-copse. The coal is brought
       either from Perth or Crieff, and, in consequence of the long car-
       riage, costs between 1s. 6d. and 1s. 8d. per cwt.
                          MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
          Since the former Statiscal Report was published, the general

       has undergone a very manifest improvements. The real rental
       was then little more than L.4500, but now it is considerably up-
