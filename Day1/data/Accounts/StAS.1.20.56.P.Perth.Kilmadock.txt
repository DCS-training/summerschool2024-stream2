   Buchany unites with another village at the burn of An-
nat, (here termed the burn of Cambus); and if ever this
were to turn a commercial district, these villages and the
town of Doune would very soon unite.
   There are no other towns or villages within the parish.

   Doune Castle.-This is a very noble and extensive edi-
fice.  It is romantically situated on a peninsula, at the junc-
tion of Teith and Ardoch, to the south-east of the town,
commanding a full view of the Teith and bridge, and sur-
rounded with groves and verdant fields.  Nature has point-
ed out this spot as a place of strength, at least well suited
to the art of war in ancient times; and, it is more than pro-
bable, that, at an early period, this spot was occupied by
some fortification, long before the present edifice was erec-
ted.  This is the more probable, when it is considered, that
the present castle was built by one of the Earls of MOn-
teith, at a time when Monteith was a lordship of regality:
It is natural to presume, that the family would have called
the edifice the Castle of Monteith, after the lordship to which
it belonged; but having called it Doune, we may suppose
that this was the ancient name of the spot whereon the build-
ding was erected.
   The word Doune is Gaelic, as most of the names of places
in this parish are.  It retains the exact sound of the Gaelic
word dun, which signifies a round hill or rising ground, the
mark over the vowel u signifying that this vowel is found-
ed long, which renders the pronunciation the same with the
present name Doune.  There is no doubt of this being the
origin of the name, for the castle stands on a beautiful
mound, at the confux of Teith and Ardoch, which, of
course, would always be called the Mound or Hill, (in Gae-
lic Dun).
