most to Inverness.  This bank has, in many places, limit-
ed the inundation.
   Above this bank, to the south-east, there is another ex-
tensive plain, of moorish ground, which has been tursed to
the gravel.  Though unfit for culture, it is well adapted to
the production of firs.  It has been tried with success since
the commons were divided, and will now be enclosed and
planted without delay.

   Surface.-In the easter end of the parish, the cultivated
lands are uncommonly slat and smooth; but, upwards from
the moor last mentioned, the cultivated land, in the wester
end, rises in a gentle acclivity toware the south.
   The surface of the cultivated parts, is agreeably diversifi-

a variety of shade and prospect, which gives the inland parts
an appearance that may be called picturesque.

   Soil.-The soil, which has been much exhausted by an
early culture, and a long continuance of incessant cropping,
is in some places a brown, and in others a black loam, ge-
nerally light, kindly, and of easy culture.  At present it is
more remarkable for sure and early crops of well filled
grain, than for many returns of the seed, which is liberally
bestowed at a boll or upwards per acre, to keep down
weeds; so that he average of crops cannot be stated at more
than 3 12 or 4 returns.  The ground is not enough retentive
of moisture, and consumes dung quickly.  Under some of
the thinner soils, there lies, about 6 inches from the sur-
