                      <TABLE=III.--POPULATION.>
The population of the town and parish of Killmarnock was, in 1763,
	by a return of Dr Webster, nearly
	In 1792,              					5000
  	   1801,						6776
	   1811,					       10148
	   1821,	     				       12769
	   1831, Males, 8673; Females, 9420; making in all     18093
	It is now believed to be about 20,000.
	The rapid advance which the town has made in the career of
manufacturing industry has caused a great and rapid increase and
influx of population. The numbers residing in the town may be
reckoned nearly 18,000; in villages, 1000; in the country, between
1000 and 1200.
	It is impossible to state the annual number of births, as so
many parents unhappily neglect to have their children's names in-
serted in the parish register. The average of deaths for the seven
years ending with December 1838 is about 460; and the average
of marriages proclaimed in these years is 196.
	There are no nobility, but several gentlemen of independent
fortune, resident within the parish. The Duke of Portland; the
Marchioness of Hastings; William Blane, Esq. of Grougar; and
William Howieson Craufurd, Esq. of Craufurdland, are the prin-
cipal heritors.
	The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50
and upwards does not exceed 10 or 12.
	The number of children in a family, in cases where there are
children, judging from a specimen taken from the town, would
seem to be nearly three and a fourth; but though a numerous off-
spring is often met with around the fireside of the working man,
still, on striking an average of some hundreds of families, the num-
ber of persons is just about four and a-half to a house.
	Character of the People.--The inhabitants are in general indus-
trious and well behaved, kind and hospitable, and in the country part
of the parish especially, they are robust and hardy, supporting, by
their vigorous proportions, the long established reputation of Ayr-
shire for the quality of her peasantry, and affording a most favourable
specimen of her "honest men and bonnie lasses." The habits and
manners of the people of Kilmarnock are much the same as those of
other manufacturing towns; while it may be observed, that, among
a large portion of them, there is very much of a decent church-going
habit; but the facility with wbich work can be procured for children,
and the tender age at which, from necessity, they are often withdrawn
from school, are operating in a moral and religious point of view,
