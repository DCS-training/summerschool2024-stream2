born; and some memorials of the family are in possession of the

  Land-owners.-The heritors of the parish are, the Right Ho-
nourable the Earl of Northesk; William Taylor Imry, Esq. of
Lunan; and James Mudie, Esq. of Pitmuies, proprietor of the
lands of Arbikie. The Earl of Northesk has about three-fifths of
the valued rental of the parish; while the other two proprietors di-
vide the remaining two-fifths between them, in nearly equal propor-
tions,-the whole valued rent being L. 1550 Scots.
	By authentic documents of very ancient date, we find, that the
lands presently in the possession of William Taylor Imry, Esq.
were originally called the kirk lands of Inverlunan, and belonged
to the Abbey of Arbroatb. By charter, bearing date 21st July
1544, these lands were given in feu by the Commendator and
Chapter of the Abbey of Arbroath to John Lord Innermeatb, and
Elizabeth Beaton, his spouse, upon payment of a specified yearly
feu-duty. By the Annexation Act 1587, these lands were annexed
to the Crown. The feu-duties were afterwards, with other lands
that belonged to the Abbey of Arbroath, erected into a temporal
Lordship, in favour of James Marquir nf Hamilton, from whom tbev
passed into the possession of the Earls of Panmure; they were
forfeited in 1715,-purchased by the York Buildings Company,-
repurchased by the late Earl of Panmure,-and finally disponed
to the late William Imry, Esq. in 1767.
	It also appears, from the chartulary of the abbey, that the whole,
lands in the parish were originally abbey lands, the rental of which
in the fifteenth century was follows:
                      Wheat.          Bear.             Meal.

  Parochial Registers.-The parochial registers commence in
1654, on the admission of the Rev. Robert Bruce; and, with some
exceptions, have been kept with tolerable accuracy since that pe-
riod. It would appear from these records, that, in the early periods of
our church, the kirk-sessions exercised a far more, extensive control
over the morals and habits of the people, than might be thought
either expedient or beneficial in the present state of society.  At
the same time, it must be acknowledged, that it is chiefly owing
