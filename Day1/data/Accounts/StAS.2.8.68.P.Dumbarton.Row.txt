   Meteorology.--From its nearness to the Frith of Clyde, and the
numerous large lochs in the neigbbourhood, the temperature of
this parish is in general mild in winter. As a proof of this, it
may be stated, that while the thermometer in the Botanical Gar-
den at Glasgow fell to 1 1/2&deg; below zero in 1838, it stood here at 15&deg;
above zero. Another proof of the mildness of the climate is seen
in the earliness with which the wild flowers make their appear-
ance. About two years ago, the common primrose was in full
flower in the side of a spring. near the manse, on the 17th of Ja-
nuary : and the -Rhododendron ponticum matures its seeds, from
which young plants spring up without any shelter or care. Through
the kindness of Lord John Campbell, I am enabled to transcribe
the following tables of observations made at Ardincaple.
