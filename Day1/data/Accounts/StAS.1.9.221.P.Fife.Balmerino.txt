twice a-week to Dundee, and it is within two miles of
Woodhaven, a public ferry, where boats constantly ply;
thus cheese, butter, poultry, eggs, &c. are easily conveyed
to a good market.  By means of the Tay likewise, coal
and lime are brought to Balmerino in such quantities, as to
serve all the purposes of fuel and agriculture.  And what
is of the greater importance, the harbour of Balmerino, a
creek belonging to the custom-house of Dundee, is the chief
place on the south side of the Tay for shipping wheat and
barley for the Forth and Canal.  The quay was at first
designed for shipping lime from the Fife hills to Dundee;
now there is not a boll that comes from thence, but, on the
contrary, some thousands from Charlestown on the Forth,
and from South Sunderland, are delivered annually to the
parish and neighbourhood.  This trade has been much on
the increase of late.  The trade of shipping wheat and bar-
ley at this port began about 30 years ago; at first, only
some farm-bolls were shipped, and afterward the mer-
chants began to buy from the farmers at the weekly mar-
ket in Cupar, and received their grain at Balmerino.  Be-
fore that period, the farmers carried their victual either
to Dundee, where the merchants shipped the surplus, or
transported it upon horseback to the south coast.  The
number of boll shipped here last year must, from the near-
est calculation, have exceeded 7000.  The harbour is but
trifling, and may, no doubt, be improved; but, as the bot-
tom is good, ships lie to and take in and deliver with ease.

manufacturing town, the weavers find plenty of work, and
the factory work finds constant employment for all the
women, who generally spin with both hands, and are at
