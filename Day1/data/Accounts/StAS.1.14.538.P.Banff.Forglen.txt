   Funds of the Poor.-Though the funded money does
not amount to a large sum, only 65 L. Sterling, yet the
poor in this parish are as well supplied as in most other
parishes, owing to the liberality of the people themselves,
and the distinguished charity of the heritors.  The For-
glen family being resident, and giving regular attendance
upon the ordinances, have afforded a continual supply to
the poor and the sick.  And Colonel Duff, when abroad
in India, appointed a very handsome sum, in place of Sun-
day collection.  The interest of 65 L., then in Lord Banff's
and Captain Hay's hands, at 5 per cent., with the ordi-
nary and sacramental collections, and produce of mort-
cloth, goes to the supply of the poor.  A meeting is held
at tha manse annually, of the heritors, minister, and el-
ders, in the end of the year, to consider the state of the
poor, and appoint supplies for them.  Blankets, clothes,
shoes, and other necessaries, are purchased for them, as
they need.  A supply of meal is appointed for the year,
and distributed in equal proportions of their quantity
monthly.  One of the elders, in the centre of the parish,
takes charge of the distribution.  By this means, the poor
are kept from wandering, there not being one belonging
to the parish that goes out of it.  In times of scarcity, up-
on application of the session, the heritors generously af-
forded the meal at the easy rate of 10 s. the boll, over
and above their other charities.  At other times, 2 mem-
bers of the session, Peter Mearson in Eastside, and Wil-
liam Robertson in Mill of Ribra, respectable men, and
men of substance, furnished it, and afforded it also at
easy rates.  This was a great saving to the fund.  Keep-
ing the poor thus comfortable within their own houses,
would be one happy mean to lessen iniquity, by prevent-
ing vagrants, thieves, and pickpockets, from going about
