	Fossil Organic Remains.--Towards the southern boundary of
the parish there are a series of hollows between the undulations of
the sandstone, some of them still in the state of lochs, and others
of marshes. On draining some of them, it has been found, that,
after penetrating a bed of soil and moss of about eight to ten feet in
thickness, great deposits of marl occur, containing an immense
number of organic remains. It is to be regretted, that, at the time
the marl was excavated, no greater attention than what curiosity
prompted was directed towards these interesting relics. Portions
of different animals have, however, been preserved; and for the
following notice of the heads of the elk and bos in the possession
of Mr Kennedy of Drummellan, I am indebted to Dr M'Tyer of
Redbrae, as also for the zoological notices which follow, and which
will be found to include several rare species.
	The fossil head of the Cervus megaceros differs from the speci-
men in the museum of the Royal Society of Dublin, in the bead
being larger, and the horns a little less, probably from the Drum-
mellan animal having been aged. The dimensions of the two spe-
cimens are as follows:

	The other head appears to have belonged to a variety of Bos
taurus, the forehead being concave. It measures ten inches be-
tween the horns, and 13 1/2 inches round the bole of the born.
Horns of the Cervus elephas were also found. Amongst the shells
in the marl I have only observed specimens of Limnea and Pla-
norbis.
	Zoology.--The rarer animals are marine, will be seen by the
following list, chiefly made up of those found on the sea coast.
