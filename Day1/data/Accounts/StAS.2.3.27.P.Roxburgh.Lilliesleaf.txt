of which still bears the latter name.  Tradition carries their an-
tiquity to a point extremely remote, andis in some degree sanc-
tioned by the discovery of two stone coffins; one containing an
earthen pot filled with ashes and arms, bearing a legible date, A. D.
727, the other dated 936, and filled with the bones of a man of
gigantic size.  These coffins were discovered in the foundations of
what was, but has long ceased to be, the chapel of Riddell, and,
as it was argued with plausibility that they contained the remains
of some ancestors of the family, they were deposited in the mo-
dern place of sepulture, comparatively so termed, though built in
1110."--Lay of the Last Minstrel, Note 20, by Sir W. Scott, Bart.*
     The aforesaid estates and lands of Riddell, &c. are now the
property of Mark Sprot, Esq. to whom they were sold about 1823.

     Upon the death of Sir John B. Riddell, Bart. of Riddell, in
April 1819, who farmed tbo'greatest part of his estate, the lands
were immediately laid out in grass.  Such a rapid change com-
pelled those who bad been employed in cultivating his extensive
domains to seek a livelihood elsewhere, and hence the immediate
declension of the population in the next succeeding year was 68.
These lands have almost wholly continued in grass ever since.
Several families and individuals have emigrated to British America
and the United States, at various periods during the last ten years.
     Under fifteen years, the number of persons is 279; from fifteen
to thirty, country part, 112, village, 73 = 185; from thirty to

most conclusively the epithet of 'Ancient Riddell.' 1st, A charter of David I. to
Walter Rydale, sheriff of Roxburgh, confirming all the estates of Lilies-clive, &c. of
which his father, Gervasius de Rydale, died possessed.  2d, A bun of Pope Adrian
IV.  confirming the will of Walter de Ridale, Knight, in favour of his brother
Anschittil de Ridale, dated 8th April 1155.  3d, A bull of Pope Alexander III.
confirming the said will of Walter de Ridale, bequeathing to his brother Anschittit
the lands of Liliesclive, Whittunes, &c. and ratifying the bargains betwixt Anschittil
and Huctredus concerning the church of Liliesclive, in consequence of the mediation
Of Malcolm II., and confirmed by a charter from that, monarch.  This bull is dasted
17th June 11 60.  4th, A bull of the same Pope, confirming the will of Sir Anschittil
de Ridale, in favour of his son Walter, conveying the said lands of Liliesclive, and
others, dated 10th Mach 1120.  It is remarkable that Liliesclive, and
or Riddell, and the Whittunes, have descended through a long train of ancestors
without ever passing into A collasteral line, to the person of Sir John Buchanan Rid-
dell, the lineal descendant and representative of Sir Anschittil."
