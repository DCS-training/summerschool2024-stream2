     of Symington.

Being at a distance from any great town, potatoes sell com-
monly at 4 s. the boll, and therefore are not raised in great
quantities, and no more than is absolutely necessary should be
raised, as they are a scourging crop, as well as lint.  One acre
of turnips will produce more food for cattle, than two acres
of potatoes*.

   Heritors, Church, School, etc.-There are 3 heritors, and
1 feuer.  The principal heritor resides occasionally.  Mr.
Lockhart of Carnwath is patron.-The living, (or more pro-
perly the starving +), is 55 L. 11 s. 1 1/3 d.  Indeed, much can-
not be expected, as the rental does not exceed 700 L.; and
there are 5 parochial churches, and 2 dissenting meeting
houses, within 3 miles of the church of Symington ++.  The
church was repaired in 1761, and the manse rebuilt in 1790.
-The schoolmaster's salary is 8 L. 6 s. 8 d.  He has taught for
these 50 years, with such fidelity and unwearied perseverance,
as, in some lines of life, would have loaded him with riches
and honour.

   Poor-The funds for the provision of the poor, are the
weekly collections, (which, at an average, amount to 6 L.
per annum), and the interest of 100 L., gradually raised by

     4 E 2

<FOOTNOTE>

*The price of labour has, of late, increased according to the rapid progress
of manufactures.  A ploughman, who was formerly hired at 5 L., now demands,
and gets, 8 L. a year; and the wages of all labourers, mechanics, &c. are raised,
nearly in the same proportion.
   +The present incumbent is married, and has six sons and one daughter.
He was admitted in 1783.
   ++Kirks have been planted, and parishes marked out, without rule or judg-
went; for there are many parishes more numerous, and many much more ex-
tensive than these six conjoined.  This is an old grievance, and ought to be re-
dressed, before any new object of reform be taken into consideration.
