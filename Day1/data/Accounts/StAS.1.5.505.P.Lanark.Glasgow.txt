Since that time, a number of others of the same kind
have been erected in the city, and so great is the additional
increase in the use of malt liquors, that most part of what
they now manufacture, is consumed at home.  As porter
brewed in the city, and its vicinity, is now much more
drunk in public houses by tradesmen, than formerly, it
has consequently diminished the consumption of whisky,
that article so destructive to the health and morals of the
people; though still it is to be lamented, that so much of
it is yet made use of.
   It would be difficult to enumerate all the different bran-

any precision, to ascertain their extent, and therefore any
thing on that head would be mere conjecture.  The conse-

9 s. to 12 s.; women employed in binding shoes, from 5 s.
to 7 s.; ordinary wrights, or carpenters, from 8 s. to 12 s.
and some of the best workmen so high as from 12 s. to
18 s.; timber fawers, about 12 s.; ordinary masons, from
10 s to 12 s. and the best workmen from 12 s. to 16 s.;
printers compositors, from 10 s. 6 d. to 18 s.; pressmen,
from 10 s. to 12 s.; bookbinders, from 7 s. to 10 s. 6 d.;
weavers, from 12 s. to 14 s. and some of the best work-
men, from 14 s. to 18 s. and even 20 s.; women and girls
for winding yarn and tambouring, about 4 s.; old men and
