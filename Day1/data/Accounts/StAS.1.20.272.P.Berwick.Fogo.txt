     Statistical Account

   Soil.-This is of two kinds; the first, a deep rich loam,
comprehending all the lands near the river, and for a consi-
derable tract of the parish; the other, a light or moorish 
loam, upon a tilly bed; this last is naturally wet, but pro-
duces good corn and grass in ordinary seasons.  The whole 
parish is arable, excepting a few acres on some of the banks 
of Blackadder, and some marshy or swampy grounds.  But 
those places that will not admit the opertions of the plough,
are not unproductive of good pasture.  The soil, in general,
seems equally adapted for grass or tillage.  A great part of 
the parish is inclosed, although a considerable quantity still 
lies open.  Since the year 1780, above 150 acres of land, 
nearly waste, or approaching to it, have been brought into 
cultivation.  About 1200 acres yet remain waste and unin-
closed.  Some of these are allowed thus to remain, chiefly 
on account of their bad quality, as being supposed incapable 
of repaying any expence that might be laid out on their 
improvement; but others are left in a state of nature, owing
more to the negligence of the possessors than to any other 
cause.

   Produce.-The produce of this parish is very valuable.
The principal crops are oats and barley; some wheat and 
pease, and a considerable quantity of clover and rye-grass 
are sown, and succeed well.  Large quantities of potatoes 
are raised, and constitute no small part of the food of the in-
habitants.  Turnips are a valuable crop here, as they an-
swerthe soil, and are extremely serviceable in feeding cattle
during winter: they are likewise much used for the keep-
ing stock.  The course of cropping on a loam, incumbent 
on a retentive sub-soil, is usually the following: 1. Oats or
barley.  2. Fallow.  3. Wheat.  4. Grass-feeds.  5. Pas-
ture, commonly four years.  The rotation on the moor-soil,
