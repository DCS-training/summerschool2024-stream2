found safety.  From this place, though there be several in-
dented hollows along the coast, and though an attempt was
lately made, by a small pier, to fit one of them to receive
boats, there is no harbour for them 4 miles rounds till they
come to Aberdeen.
   The latitude is 57 deg. 9 min. north; the longitude is 2
deg. 9 min. west.  In time of war a flag is hoisted on a staff
half a mile from the point, on the most raised eminence, as
a signal, when an enemy's ship is in the offing.  There is
free open sea along this coast.  The water rises, at spring
tides, 13 feet 5 and the height of the stream is at 45 minutes
past noon, at full and change.  The tide of flood runs south-
west and by south; that of ebb, north-east half north, and
at the rate of 3 and 4 knots in the hour.  The variation of
the compass is 25 degrees west, and has increased a degree
within there 7 years.  From 6 and 8 fathoms at the rock

miles, falls here into the sea.  On this side of the harbour

in cargoes of stones; above which lie the boats of the fisher-

The tide flows more than two miles farther up the river, to

but there is no navigation up the stream, except for boats and
lighters about a mile, on account of the shallows in it.  The
