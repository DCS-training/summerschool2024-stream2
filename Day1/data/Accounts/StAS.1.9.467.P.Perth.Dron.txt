from the hills, and formed like a ridge, sloping on every
side to the N. and S. extending westward with a gradual
ascent, and terminating a little beyond a farm, which
lies on the most elevated part of it, and is named
West Dron.  There are several other places in different
parts of the country, which have the same name of Dron;
and they have all a situation somewhat similar.  The pa-
rish is situated about a mile S. of the river Earn, and 5
miles S. L of the town of Perth.  It extends in length
from E. to W. between 3 and 4 miles, including a narrow
strip of the lands of Pitkeathly, in Dumbarnie parish, which
intersects it, and in breadth from N. to S. about 3 miles.
The principal and lower part, stretches, in a sloping posi-
tion along the bottom of the Ochil hills, which form the
southern boundary of the rich and beautiful vale of Strath-
earn, and presents to the view of the traveller, passing along
the great road which leads from Perth to Kinghorn and
the Queensferry, a very agreeable prospect of well culti-
vated and inclosed fields.  The face of the hills here is va-
rious, In some places they exhibit an irregular and bro-
ken surface, roughened by projecting rocks, and over-
grown with surze; but even there, considerable patches of
coin land, producing barley and oats, are to be seen inter-
spersed.  In others the descent is more smooth and regu-
lar, uniformly green, and adorned with strips and clumps
of plantation.  Some are covered with an extensive wood
of firs, birch, ash, etc. which at once ornaments the pro-
spect and enriches the country.  When fully grown, it will
afford a copious supply of timber for all necessary uses, an
article grown scarce, and much wanted here.  A few farms,
more extensive than rich, occupy the higher part of the pa-
rish, being situated on the summit of the Ochil hills.
