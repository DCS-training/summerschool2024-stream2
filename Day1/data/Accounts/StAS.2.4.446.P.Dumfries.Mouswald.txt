	potatoes and turnips,                                      1250    0   0
	hay, both meadow and cultivated,                           1000    0   0
         flax grown for family use,                                   25    0   0
	pasture, rating at L. 2, 10s. per cow or full-grown ox,     500    0   0

        Thus making the total annual value of raw produce,      L.  7620    0   0

	Rent of Land.--The rent of arable land in this parish varies, ac-
cording to soil and situation, from L. 2 to 6s. per acre.
	Breeds of Live-Stock.--The common breed of cattle kept by the
farmers in general is the Galloway; to the improvement of which
great attention has been paid by selecting stock and bulls of the
purest kind. In this district, farmers find it their advantage to be
careful in rearing good stock, as their profits depend more upon a
good sale of their black-cattle, than on their grain produce. Be-
sides, no breed of cattle is more sought after or so readily bought
up by the English dealers. Cows of the pure Galloway breed
bring from L. 8 to L. 10; two year old stots of the same kind,
from L. 5 to L. 7, 1OS. Farmers in general sell their young stock
at this age.
	Farm horses able for their work, of which a considerable num-
ber is reared in the parish, bring from L. 20 to L. 30; and some of
great power and fine symmetry, L. 45. Great numbers of pigs are
both reared and fed in this parish. Farmers now think it more pro-
fitable to consume their oats and potato crop in feeding swine than
by carting them to the Dumfries market, particularly as a ready
market is found for the pork to be carried into England.
