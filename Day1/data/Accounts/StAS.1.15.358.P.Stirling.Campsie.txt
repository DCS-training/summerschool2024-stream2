     Statistical Account

   Population.-This present year, 1793, when the numeration
was made, there were 2517 souls.  The population of this pa-
rish has increased 900, since December 1783, the number then
being 1627.  In Dr Webster's account it is given up at 1400.
From several facts in the possession of the writer of this ac-
count, the population of this parish seems somewhat to have
declined from the Revolution till the year 1763.  The chief
cause which has been assigned for this circumstance, was the
throwing several small tenements together, making one large
farm, whereby a number of families were thrown out of bread,
and obliged to emigrate to large towns for their daily sub-
sistence.  The number of householders or reeks, previous to
the 1783, I cannot mark positively; in that year there were
317; population then being somewhat better than five to a
family; in the present year, there are 609 householders, or
people who keep reeks, so that the number of souls have not
increased in the same proportion as that of householders: the
reason is obvious:  Several young people, printers and pencil-
lers, at the different printfields, keep houses either singly, or
perhaps, though married, have not as yet more than one
child; so that the population in this parish even supposing
the householders not to increases is not come to its just level.
To shew the proportions from the Revolution to the year
1736, I have subjoined the following table; each statement
containing the average of baptisms for five years:
