	       I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name and Boundaries.--IN old records, we find the name of this
parish spelled Ruthvance, and Ruthvens; it is now always written
Ruthven, and pronounced Riven. The parish is nearly a square
of two miles, pleasantly situated on the north side of Strathmore;
bounded on the west and north by the parish of Alyth; and on
the south and east, by the parish of Airlie.
	Topographical Apprearances.--The general appearance of the
parish is pleasant, having a gentle slope towards the south, varied
by some inequalities. One of the eminences is called the Gal-
low's hill, being the spot where the barons of Ruthven erected the
gibbet, in feudal times. A small field adjoining is still known by
the name of the hangman's acres.
	Soil and Climate.--The soil in general is, a light loam, on a
gravelly bottom. The climate is dry and temperate, and the si-
tuation healthy.
	Plantations.--The inferior grounds are well clothed with thriv-
ing plantations of larch and Scotch firs; and on the banks of the
Isla is a considerable extent of oak copse, which is both profitable
and highly ornamental. It is worthy of remark, that while woods
of this description, (oak copse), are so abundant west of this, none
are to be found farther east on the south front of the Grampians.
	Hydrography.--The river Isla, after forming the boundary on
the north, turns suddenly in the direction from northwest to south-
east, leaving the largest portion of the parish on the east side.
The bed of the Isla here is rocky, the banks bold, and covered
with natural coppice and plantations. The scenery in many
places is very beautiful. This Parish is well watered, there being,
besides the Isla, a considerable steam, many excellent springs of
water, some, of which are strongly impregnated with the oxide of
iron. Such names of places as Brigton, Bridgend, Milton, Craigy.
