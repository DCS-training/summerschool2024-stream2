                KINCARDINE IN MONTEITH.

    PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE, SXNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING.

       THE REV.  ALEXANDER GRAY, D.D., MINISTER.



              I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
      Name and Boundaries.-IN the county of Perth there are the
    castle of Kineardine in Strathearn, the town of Kincardine in the
    parish of Tulliallan, and the parish of Kincardine in Monteith.
    This name is of Gaelic origin, and is said by the author of the
    former Statistical Account of this parish, to mean tlte head of the
    shore.  This countenances the opinion generally entertained, that
    the carse in the vicinity of the church and manse, and which
    forms a very important part of the parish, was, at a remote period,

    friendship and protection in times of danger.
      This locality favours this interpretation, becausd, adjoining the
    old church and manse, and where the minister lately bad his gar-
    den, there was a foss or moat, and what were vulearly called the
    Auld Wa's, being the remains of an old castle.  There is besides,
    at a short distance westward, a commanding point called the
    Ward, and a tumulus about an equal distance eastward, of consi-
    derable elevation, both of which are supposed to have been watch-
    towers.  The author of the Account of the parish of Kincardine in
    Ross-shire adopts this latter etymology, and says that the chief of
