mosses are full of decayed fir trees, and whole roots of a very large
size, and perfectly sound, are often dug, supplying the people of the
country with faggots to light up their cottages in the winter nights,
and when dried well are not a bad substitute for oil or candle.
     Forest and Zoology.-Atholl Forest is understood to mean a
mountainous tract of land furnished solely with deer and other
game. Its extent and superiority to every other forest are well
known. Its immunities and privileges in former times were great,
which may be seen from the following curious legal document.
   Report concerning Forestries, &c. in Scotland, anno 1680. (From the original.)---
At Edinburgh, the eighth day of July, sixteen hundred and eightie years, anent the
supplicatione presented to the Lords of Counsell and Sessione, by Alexander Robert,
son of Fascallie, shewing, that where the petitioner baveing obtaineat ane signature,
superscrived by his Majestic's royal hand, of his lands and baronie of Fascallie, contain-
ing an novedamus and erection of the outfield, woods, &c.; which the petitioner hav-
ing presented to the Lords of Treasurie and Exchequer, to be past by them, after
revising thereof; the same was taken up by the Marquis of Atholl, to see, and re-
fused to be reproduced until the Lords ordained him to do the same; and, after re-
production thereof, the petitioner having addressed himself by ane supplicatione to
the said Lords of Exchequer, craving that the said signature might be past; the said
Lords of Exchequer, by an act made by them thereanent, upon the eleventh day of
February last by past, recommended to the Lords of Counsell and Sessione aforesaid,
to consider the import and priveledge of a forrestrie, and how far his Majestie's inte-
rest might be concerned in the foresaid signature, or the lyke; craving, therefore, that
the saids Lords of Sessione would appoint a tyme to the effect foresaid, as the said
supplicatione at length bears,-Which being read in the presence of the saids Lords
of Counsell and Sessione, they recommended to Sir Alexander Seatoun of Pitmedden,
ane of the saids Lords of Counsell ther own number, to call both parties before him;
and to hear them and ther Prors upon the said matter, and to make report thereof
to them. According whereunto the said Lord Pitmedden having called both parties,
and ther Prors. before him, and having heard them debait in the said matter, did
make report of the same to the said Lords of Counsell and Sessione; which report
being considered by the said Lords, they appoynteat Charles Maitland of Hattoun
Lord Treasurer Deput, Sir Thomas Murray, Lord Regr. Sir David Falconer of New-
toun, and the said Sir Alexander Seatoun of Pitmedden, four of the saids Lords
their own number, to prepare ane report to the saids Lords of Exchequer, anent the
import and priveledge of ane forrestrie, and how far his majestie's interest may be
concerned in the said signature, or the lyke.  Lykeas, according to the foresaid re-
commendation, the saids Lords Treasurer, Deput Register, Newtoun, and Pitmedden,
having considered the debait in the said matter, betwixt the said supplicant Prors.
and likelwayes the Pror. of the said Marquis of Atholl, heretable keeper of his Ma-
jestie's forrestrie in Atholl, neir adjacent to Fascallie's estate, they fand, That by
the lawes and acts of the Parliament of this kingdom, the priveledge and import of
ane forrestrie is, That it is a place appoynted for deer, and for hunting; and that
any deer or cattle, or other beasts that are found within the forrestrie, are confiscable
to the proprietor and keeper of the forrest; and that his Majestie's and his liedge's in-
terest is, That whereas, by the lawes and custom, of this kingdom, no man is obliged
to herd his cattle, or other beasts, except wben the corns are upon the ground, after
quhilk, the possessor of the ground may keep ther own ground, and turn of other
folk's cattle, but cannot oblidge them to herd, or keep ther cattle, or pay for the trans-
gressione, except in the case of enclosures, where violence is done to the dykes there-
of; yet this forrestrie now craved, is not to be enclosed, as commonlie forrestries are
open. And by the erecting of new forrestries, all the neighbouring heritors must
either herd their goods through the whole year, and keep them off these forrestries;
or otherwise suffer the loss of them, by being confiscate for pasturing upon these for-
restries. And it is represented, that, in this particular case, there is a forrestrie of the
King's foresaid, in which ther is a considerable stock of deer, as the report of the saids
four Lords in the said matter at lenth bears; which being read in presence of,
