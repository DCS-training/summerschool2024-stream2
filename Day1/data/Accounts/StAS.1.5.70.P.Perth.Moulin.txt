Atholl and Badenoch in the 14th century.  A tradition
prevails, that a number of persons, infected with the

Hence it is thought unsafe, by the country people, to re-

has been known, for many years back, by the name of
the Old Castle of Moulin.  The vestiges of small circular
buildings supposed to have been Pictish forts, are to be

   Fossils.-The scull of a large horned animal was found,
some years ago in a marl pit, half a mile from Moulin, and
is preserved at Atholl House.  The head is shaped like that

length of the scull, from the edge of the bone between the

the greatest circumference of the pith, 13 inches; the dia-
meter of the eye socket, 3 1/2 inches; and the distance be-
