Accurate and beautiful descriptions of this place have been
given to the public, by Mr Pennant and others, to which
descriptions the reader is referred.
   Besides the parish church, there is a chapel at Lawers, on
the north side of Loch Tay, where the ministers of Ken-
more and Weem preach occasionally.  Here the Society for
Propagating Christian Knowledge established, in the year
1790, a mission, on a fund mortified by the late Lady Gle-
norchy, of of which they have the management.  Out of this
fund one half of the missionary's salary is paid; the hearers
pay the other.  Lord Breadalbane gives a manse and glebe.
In this mission the present minister of Kenmore officiated,
for about three years previous to his settlement there, which
was on the 13th March 1794.  In this parish are no secta-
ries of any denomination whatever.

   Schools.-The parochial school, which is kept in the vil-
lage of Kenmore, is generally frequented by about 100 scho-
lars, except in summer and autumn, when many of the
youth, being necessarily engaged in husbandry business, can-
not attend their education.  The Society for Propagating
Christian Knowledge in Scotland maintains four schools
within the bounds of the parish.  Private schools are also
occasionally kept in different parts of the parish, and their
teachers supported solely by the scholars parents.  At pre-
sent there are no fewer than four of these private schools,
but the number of scholars is not great.

   State of the Poor.-The number of poor upon the parish
roll amounts to 40, exclusive of the poor of those parts of
the parish that are connected with Killin and Amulree.  The
funds for their maintenance in this, as well as in all the
neighbouring parishes, arise chiefly from weekly collections
