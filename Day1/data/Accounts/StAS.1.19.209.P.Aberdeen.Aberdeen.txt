     of Aberdeen.

   Milling, dying, and dressing of cloth, is done in the same
manner as at Leeds.
   At a period when the aids wanted by Government are
so considerable, the Legislature ought to do every thing to
encourage and strengthen the manufactures of the country.
In 1782, Parliament granted a drawback of the duty of
soap used in bleaching and cleaning linen and other goods.
But a farther drawback is yet necessary with respect to
ashes used in bleaching, which drawback, although very
trifling to Government, would be of consequence to manu-
facturers in many respects.  The member of Parliament
who will give himself the trouble to examine into the uti-
lity of this drawback, and step forward to procure it, will
deserve better of his country, than the man who, by a con-
tinual opposition to Government, endeavours to raise a
name to himself, by pretending to be the people's friend.
The people's best friend, is the man who contrives to se-
cure their property, and increase their trade by unfettering
their manufactures.

     Trade and Commerce.

   The state of the trade and commerce of this city, at dif-
ferent periods, will be seen from the following tables of the
shipping, etc. of the Port of Aberdeen.
