   Manufatures and New Village.-This parish is on the eve
of experiencing a great change, by the introduction of ma-
nufactures, on a very large scale.  A cotton mill is just
erected on the estate of Culcruich, 156 feet in length, and
10 feet wide; which, when finished, will employ 1000 hands.
A handsome village, upon a rising ground along the side of
the Endrick, is already feued off, and budding for the recep-
tion of the work people.  The houses, according to a regular
plan, are to stand in one row, and to consist of two stories
and garrets. Thus situated, the village will be well aired,
dry and healthy; and very pleasant, having the gardens in
front, separated from the houses by the turnpike road, dressed
on a sloping bank down to the river.
