dition of 1 bushel of rye-grass feed), is sown in each acre a-
long with the barlay.  The return is from 5 to 10 bolls an
acre.  Grass is partly cut green for summer food to the
work horses and milk cows, and sometimes for a few young
cattle in the straw yard; also a little for pasture to give the
cows an airing.  The rest of it, which will commonly be
about the half, is made into hay; which the farmer uses for
his own horses, or occasionally sells.  The quantity of hay
upon an acre will be from 200 to 400 stones, 22 lib. avoir-
dupois to the stone.  The first crops were more luxuriant;
about 500 stones of excellent hay have been produced, at an
average, over a large field.  Some of the stems of clover, in
the swath after the mower, measured in length 4 feet.  From
the loss of milk cows, and the danger well known in pastur-
ing red clover by horned cattle, some of the farmers are now
laying down part of their land with white clover, rye, and
rib grass for pasture.  Oats are sown in March and the be-
ginning of April; the ground is prepared by 1 plowing; the
returns from 8 to 12 bolls an acre.  One man and a pair of
horses plow in the low ground.  The ploughs are of diffe-
rent kinds, some with iron heads, some with crooked socks,
chains below the beam, etc.; but all with cast iron mould-
boards.-The harrows are different; some coupled one way,
some another, some drawn by a pair of horses, some by a
single horse.  The rollers used are of different constructions
and different weights, for the purposes of breaking clods,
smoothing the surface for the smaller seeds, and condensing
the lighter soils.  There are 4 threshing machines which are
found to answer well.-Harvest begins in the month of Sep-
tember, sometimes later even in the low ground, and always
in the hills.  Some of the farmers that have settled here from
other parts of the country, owing possibly to the smallness
of their stock, the exhausted state of the ground at their
