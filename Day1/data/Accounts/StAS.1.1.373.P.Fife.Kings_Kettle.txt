and horses are also engaged in conveying the lime to New-
burgh port, for the Carse of Gowrie, and other parts of
Perthshire, &c.  The coals with which it is burnt are brought
from Balbirnie and Balgonie, about 3 miles distant.  A large
quantity of iron-stone, excellent in quality, is found on seve-
ral parts of these estates.

   In Barntark Muir, the surface of which is a common, and
covered with heath, coals have long been procured.  For
want of proper contrivances to carry off the water, they have
not as yet been wrought far below the surface.  These mines,
which are the property of Alexander Murray.  Esq; of Ayton,
have been let, for the last 40 years, to Alexander Low, Esq;
who is now seriously engaged in attempting to obviate those
inconveniencies which have hitherto impeded the working.
The coals are of a superior quality, most of them resembling
the oily Newcastle coal.  There is another stratum of coal,
but inferior in quality, at Dovan, belonging to Dr Pitcairn.
Coals have also been  procured at Clothie, en estate belong-
ing to Mr Balfour.  Some time since, when sinking a shaft
to discover the extent of the coals, some metallic ores were
discovered, which have not as yet been essayed.  When
thrown into the fire, they emit a sulphureous smell, and in
appearance resemble pyrites.  The price of coals at Balgonie
and Balbirnie Hill is 7 d. per 18 stone Dutch weight.
