many families were absent at the sea shore, and numbers of the
younger branches were employed as herds on the higher grounds
in the adjacent part of the country and in Strathmore.  My own
visiting list shows, during the last five years, 825 as the lowest, and

   Agriculture.-The number of acres cultivated, or occasionally
in tillage, is upwards of 3000, Scotch measure.  Several hundred
acres might be reclaimed from the river, and are now in process
of being added.  Under thriving woods and plantations are about
400 acres.  Considerable sums of money are annually realized
from the sale of the prunings, thinnings, &c. and the manage-
ment is excellent.
   The grass parks let from L.l to L.6 per acre.
