  wbich nothing but the full, unfettered, and frequent ministrations
  of the glorious Gospel of the grace of God, carried home on the
  heart by the power of the Holy Spirit, can effectively counteract.
    On December 6, 1840, the number of persons on the Commu-
  nion Roll was, of males, 132; of females, 356; total, 487. The
  Lord's Supper is dispensed t  wice a-year in this parish; and the
  dispensation of it is attended by immense crowds of people from
  the neighbouring parishes.  It is, indeed, a high solemnity.
    Manse.-In 1702, the manse was not habitable.  In 1709, it
  was a heap of rubbish.  In 1710, a house in the burgh was bought
  for a manse.  In 1728, a manse was ordered to be built on the
  site of the original one, near the church-yard.  The present manse,
  which stands in the glebe, a little to the west of the town, was
  erected in 1786.  It is a plain but substantial building, and is
  capable, with some repairs, of being made a very comfortable re-'
  sidence.  The office-houses, which are thatched, are ruinous.
  It is expected that they will speedily be rebuilt.
    Glebe.-Tbe glebe consists of two parts; the lower, of about
  9 acres, in which the manse stands, and the upper, a mile to the
  west, on the north side of the River of Wick about 30 acres.
  In 1836, the glebe was valued by the Commissioners of Religious
  Instruction at L. 50 a-year.
    Stipend.-In 1792, the stipend was L.97, 13s. 4d.; in 1810,
  it was L.50, and 160 bolls of victual.  At present' it consists of
  17 chalders, half oatmeal, half bear, payable at the fiar prices,
  and L.IO of money.
    Teinds.-The teinds of this parish belong to the Crown.  In
  1836, the value of the unappropriated teind was L.340, 9s. 4d.
