grations of young people of both sexes, who, thinking their
parents oppressed in their farms, go away to other parts, and
other employments; fewer of those who remain joining in
marriage now than formerly; and, above all, the monopoly
of farms, which so much prevails; some individuals rent-
ing and farming lands, formerly possessed by 6, 8, or 10,
and some even possessed by 20 tenants; these and many o-
ther circumstances, account for and prove the great decrease
of the population.  No enumeration of this parish, however,
previous to the one drawn up in 1755, at the request of Dr
Webster, has been made; or, if it was, can now be discover-
ed.  Upon comparing that report, however, with the result
of an enumeration made by the present incumbent in 1792
the decrease within these 40 years does not appear to great,
as, from tile above causes, might have been expected:

<TABLE>

For the number of souls in 1755 was                  1192
Ditto in 1792,                                       1136

Hence the decrease is only                             56
Of these there were examinable persons,        703
Children under that age,                       433   1136
Married persons,                               326
Widows and widowers,                            83    
Bachelors and unmarried women,                 294    703
Inhabitants in the village,                           112
Poor on the roll,                                      10
The No. of births*, from December 1792 to De-
  cember 1793, was                                     30
       Marriages* within that period,                   9
       Deaths*,                                        29

<FOOTNOTE>

*No record of funerals had ever been kept in the parish previous to
December 1792; nor, for a long time, was there even any register of births
or marriages; but, upon the moot accurate enquiry that can be made, the a-
bove appear to be the average numbers for many years past.
