     Origin of the Name.

   DUNBLANE is supposed to take its name from St
Blane, the tutelar saint of the place.  It was once a cell
of Culdees; and, in the reign of King David, was erected in-
to a bishop's fee*.  It is uncertain at what time, or by whom
the cathedral was built.  The chartulary, and other records
of the bishopric of Dunblane, are not to be found.  The
diocese consisted of part of Perth and Stirling shires.  The
rental of the bishopric, at the Reformation, was nearly as
follows: 1 Chalder wheat; 11 chalders, 11 bolls, 3 firlots,
and half a peck of bear; 50 chalders, 1 boll, 1 firlot, 3 pecks
and a half of meal; 9 chalders and 12 bolls of oats; and
313 l. Scots+.
