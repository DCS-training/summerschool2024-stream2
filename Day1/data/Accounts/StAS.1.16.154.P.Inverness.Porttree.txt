of the country, is at present any where sold; and there the
common price in spring is 1 s. per peck.  Some fell their
butter and cheese at 17 s. the double stone, and none under
14 s.  Cattle that formerly fetched only from L. 1, 10 s. to
L 2, 10 s. have since sold for from L. 3 to L. 4, 10 s. the
price of sheep and weathers now varies from 4 s. to 6 s. and
of horses from L. 2, 10 s. to 6 guineas.  This difference of
prices may be accounted for from the increase of popula-
tion, and introduction of paper currency into the country;
the latter of which, occasioning the circulation of money in
greater plenty, helped to diminish its value.
   Some servants shoes just now cost their masters nearly as
much as their wages 20 or 30 years ago amounted to.  The
common wages for men-servants is from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3,
10 s. and of overseers from L. 3 to 5 guineas, besides their
shoes and maintenance, and sometimes the grass of a cow,
and tillage of a little lands; when they have grass, or any
tillage, their other wages is something less.  A woman-
servant gets from 12 s. to 20 s. with shoes; housekeepers
more; but this statement regards only the gentlemen
tacksmen, of whom there are but five in the parish.  The
other tenants generally get theirs at an easier rate, the rea-
son of which is, pershaps, that they eat at the same table
with themselves, and seldom work but when their masters
partake of the labour.  The increase in servant wages is
in a great measure owing to many of the young people,
particularly the men, going out the beginning of every
year to the low countries for work, from which they do
not begin to return till the latter end of October; also,
since the manufacturing of kelp became an object of im-
portance, great numbers prefer it, though troublesome, to
any other work, because in it they can earn from 1 s. 6 d.
to 3 s. per week, according to their labour.  In other in-
stances labourers are seldom hired for the week or day;
