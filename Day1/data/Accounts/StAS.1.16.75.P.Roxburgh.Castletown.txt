place, consisting of about two acres of ground, round which
the buildings consist of two stories.  Near each extremity
there is a smaller square.  The street is 54 feet wide; in
the principal square it is 100 feet.  It was begun in March
last; and at present there are 23 houses either inhabited,
or nearly finished.  Each house costs from L. 35 to L. 40
Sterling.  They hold of the Duke, pay a small sum by
way of feu-duty, and have each a good garden.  Every
feuer has grass for a cow on the hill, for which they pay
L. 1.  For each house they have two acres of holm land,
for 14 years, for which they pay a certain sum.  A situ-
ation more favourable for carrying on manufactures is
scarcely to be found.  Its local advantages are very great.
Within 100 yards of peat, and only about 3 miles from coal,
it has water at command to drive machinery of any extent.
Wool, the staple commodity of the country, grows on the
side of every hill.  There is an excellent road lately made
by Canonby to Carlisle, the Solway frith, etc.  Possessed of
these advantages, it solicits some person of enterprize and
industry to improve them.  When we consider what has
been done in Galashiels, etc. and in situations far less fa-
vourable, it is hoped the time is not far distant, when such
advantages as these will attract the attention of the manu-
facturers either of flax, wool, or cotton; and instead
sending the wool, the raw material, to Leeds, Huddersfield,
etc. by a long and expensive land carriage, it will be ma-
nufactured here where it grows, enrich the country by en-
couraging industry, adding to population, and by giving
bread and employment to hundreds of all ages.
