     (9) Lake of Mullion.
     (10) Dry-bed ofthe Shochie, below the Dunkeld road.  Not thought indigenous.
     (11) This white variety of Digitalis purpurea, originally found in fields, h`s
    popagated itself in the garden for ten years, without once changing its colour.
     (12) Upper fields of the mill-lands of Pitcairn, very rare.
     (13) Dry bank at Stanley, and fields on Redgorton bill, rare.
     (14) This singularly rare plant, of which Sir W. J Hooker gives only one very
    sparing station in Scotland, and Sir J. Smith only two in England, grows, by no
    means sparingly on the banks of the Almond, below the old bridge.
     (15) The banks of the Tay are in some places quite clothed with this beautiful and
    graceful plant, decidedly the most splendid of British creepers.
     (16) Banks of the Tay and Almond, by no means sparingly.
     (17) Fields of Redgorton hill and Broxie.
     (18) Banks of the Tay on Hatton farm, along with perforaturn, distinguishable
    at first sight by its smaller flowers, and more rugose leaves.
     (19) This very beautiful plant, though considered rare in Scotland, is common in
    all the woods in this parish.
     (20) Fields of Pitmurthly and Redgorton hill.
     (21) Vibinity of gardens, certainly not indigeous.
     (22) Redgordon Den, sometimes six feet high.
     (23) This curious and rare plant has been found near Luncarty mill.
     (24) Sir J. Smith gives this as a distinct species, but Sir W. J. Hooker does not
    admit of its being distinct from Alpinum.  Where such authorities differ, it would
    be presumption in us to decide; the more especially as there are some circumstances
                 connected with the plant and its habitat, which seem to favour respectively both sides
                 of the question.  On the one hand, the Alpinum is not found in the vicinity of the
                 habitat of uniflorum, and the plant has always a single terminal flower, with erect
                 ra ; which seem to favour Sir J. Smith's position. But, on the other hand, the
                 pint is only found on the shelving rocks of the Almond, which are occasionally co-
                 vered with water, which seems to favour the supposition that the seed may have been
                 brought down by the river from the higher ground where Allpinurn grows.  But
                 then again the plant is not found on rocks similarly situated on the Tay ; and there
                 seems reason to think that, ifthe one river should bring down the seed of Alpinum,
                 sowould the other, as is the case with Saxi-fraga aizoides, above referred to.
                 Sir W. J. Hooker mentions that Alpinum is often single flowered; and states
                 also that it is sometimes found with rays erect.  If it should turn out, on fartber ex-
                 arnination, that it is only the one-flowered specimens that have erect rays, it would cer-
                 tainly establish Sir J. Smith's specific disd ction.
                 (25) This pretty plant, though found growing wild here, and though so common
                 In Ayrshire, as, in some places, to be considered a troublesome weed, is not allowed
                 to fie a native, and has not been admitted into any British Flora.
                 (26) This uncommon plant, which has been rarely found in this parisb, grows co-
                 piously on the opposite banks of the river Almond, in the wood of Methven.  We
                 may be mention that Corallorbiza innata, which is stated by Sir W. J. Hooker to be
                 destroyed there, has been recently found, and carefully preserved by Mr Bishop.
                 (27) Fulva of Sir J. Smith.  Redgorton wood.
