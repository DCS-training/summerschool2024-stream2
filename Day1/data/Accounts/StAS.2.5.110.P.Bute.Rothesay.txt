	The cows are chiefly of the Ayrshire breed, and are kept for the
dairy. Much attention is paid to their improvements. the cheese
made in this parish is equal to the best Dunlop, and brigs as high
a price in the market.
	Wages.--Ploughmen's wages vary from L. 5 to L. 9 the half-
year; a woman sservant's L. 2, 10s. to L. 4, 10s. for an equal
term. a labourer reveives from is. 6d. ti 2s. a day; a mason 3s.;
a wright 3s.; a reaper 2d. an hour, without board. An iron plough
costs about three guineas.
	Fisheries.--Herring fishing is carried on to a considerbale ex-
tent in the Kyles of Bute, and the adjacent salt water lakes. A
salmon-fishing has lately been established round the shores by the
Marquis of Bute, which promises to prove very advantageous.
There is, besides, a regular fishing of haddocks, whitings, acaithes,
and soles, which furnish an abundant and cheap supply to the
Rothessay market. Large quantities of cockles are gathered at St
Ninian's bay, and sent to Glasgow by a number of poor people,
who thus make their living. There are no means of estimating
the yearly value of the fisheries.

<FOOTNOTE>This includes about 270 acres of coppies, consisting chiefly of oak ash, elm, and
beech. The planted woods comprehend oak, ash, beech, and the various species of
fir, which all thrive well. It has for the most part been planted within the last twenty-
years.
