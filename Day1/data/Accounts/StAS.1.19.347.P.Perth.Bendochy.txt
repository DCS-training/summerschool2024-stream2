turage.  Formerly they used tumbler sledges for carts;
the wheels and axle being all of one piece; they now use
carts of a proper construction.  Almost all this parish was
abbey lands.  At the Reformation, the monks sold the lands,
and the tenants who resided generally became the purchasers.
The circumstance of their purchase made little alteration
on their manner of living.  Anciently there was no glass
in the windows, but only wooden boards; now every
window has some glass.  There are six gentlemen's houses,
and five farm houses two stories high.  The inhabitants
formerly had, and some still have, vile smoaky houses for
want of vents.  This has begun to be remedied in some
low thatched houses, by building a three feet wide chimney
of mason-work, six feet high, and letting a clay and stake
vent above it to go out at the top, three feet wide within
every way; narrow vents of mason-work being found to be
dangerous in thatched houses.

   Tacks.-In the low country part of the parish, the tenants
have all tacks of 19, or a smaller number of years; and
their rent is paid commonly after the crop is sold and dis-
posed of.  In the Highland districts they scarcely have any
tacks, and as the tenant may go when he pleases, the rent
is paid commonly before the crop is off the ground, ac-
cording to the practice of the neighbouring Highlands.  For
some time by gone, the tacks of Lord Privy Seal's tenants
have been renewed two years before their expiration.  A
reasonable rent is fixed on by the heritor, in which the te-
nant finds it his interest to concur.  The consequence is, they
are all old tenants on this estate.  One family has seen out
the century in the same place.  In the estates of some
other proprietors of the parish, some farms have been let
(by newspaper advertisements for private offers) to the
highest bidders; this makes lauded property an object only
