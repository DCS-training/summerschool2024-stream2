350 L. 6 s. 2 d. Anno 1780, again railed to 840 L. Scots; two
chalders meal, one ditto bear, valued at 80 L. per chalder.
Glebe about five acres.  The minister had pasturage in Stow
common, (I suppose by use and wont).  The common was
divided anno 1756, and 19 acres were allotted to the mini-
ster.-A new manse was built anno 1782.  The kirk two
years before that was repaired, plastered on the roof and walls,
and every way rendered decent and commodious.

   Population.-From a list taken anno 1716 and 1717, of
those above 8 years old, 1035; another anno 1779, 1400
and upwards.  This increase can only be attributed to the
improvement of agriculture, no manufactures being yet esta-
blished.  The people, in general, are healthy and robust,
subject to few diseases.  The greatest part of these arise from
want of cleanliness and foul feeding, such as diseased sheep,
and fish that come up at spawning time.  Epidemical diseases
have seldom proved fatal; but, of late years, there have been
more consumptions and nervous complaints than formerly.
This is perhaps to be attributed to the immoderate use of
spirituous liquors, and the introduction of tea of the work
quality, drunk too hot, which may produce the most fatal
effects on the nervous system.
   Gala-water was formerly famed for great plenty of excel-
lent trouts.  There in number are greatly decreased since the
introduction of lime as a manure.

   Face of the Country, etc.-The country is hilly.  Towards
the water tides it is mostly covered with a short green sward;
towards the higher grounds, heath, bent, and ling, generally
prevail, which last proves a good feed for sheep in spring.
