of this county into money, which, from the trial that has

most beneficial effects.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The principal advantages of
this parish may be accounted the dry soil and the good wa-
ter with which it abounds, and the facility with which
roads may be made through most places of it.  The chief
disadvantage is the distance and high price of coal, lime,
and foreign manure; in consequence of which it will not
probably, at least for a course of years, become a consider-
able seat of manufactures.  There are extensive peat mos-
ses in the parish and neighbourhood.  This, however, is
found to be a precarious and even an expensive fuel.
Coals are every year becoming more in use, although the
greatest part of them must be brought from about Glas-
gow, distant 13 or 14 miles; and, when carried by land,
now cost 7 s. the cart of 10 or 11 hundred weight*.
   The prices of provisions, the day's wages of labourers
in husbandry, of carpenters, masons, tailors, &c. and the
wages of servants, are the same in this parish as in the neigh-
bouring parishes of Houston and Kilallan.  See vol. I.
p. 324, 325.  It may now be added to what is there stated,
that in consequence of the rapid progress of manufactures
in Paisley and the neighbouring towns and villages, the
wages of country servants and labourers are continually ri-
sing, and to such a degree as to be severely felt by the
farmers in the country.  The sums, though considerable,
