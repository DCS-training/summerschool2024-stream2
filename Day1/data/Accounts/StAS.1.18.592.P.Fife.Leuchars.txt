     Statistical Account

the court, which, to the astonishment of those who lived there
some years ago, became dry when the water was let out of
the moat, for the purpose of scouring it.  The workmen
came at last upon the mouth of a covered drain, which they
found on a level with the bottom of the well; and upon going
down into the well, they discovered the same drain open
there; from which they were naturally led to think, that the
inhabitants had been supplied with water from the moat with-
out, when surrounded by an enemy.
   On this estate, also are some fine old trees.
   Mr Lindsay has planted 138 acres with various kinds of
timber; the plantation is in the most thriving state, and gives
a most delightful rest to the eye, where once there was no-
thing to be seen, but a moor producing some coarse grass,
heath, and furze.  The traveller too, is pleased with the va-
riety of nature's luxuriant productions.  Mr Lindsay has also
inclosed several fields with ditch, hedge, and dyke; and
hedge rows of trees.  These will in a short time, shelter and
beautify the district.  In the meantime, they pleasingly em-
ploy the imagination in anticipating what their maturity may
produce.  On the estate of Leuchars, have been built 5 farm
steadings, suitable to, and convenient for the different farms,
where the tenants are lodged, if not elegantly, yet with suit-
able conveniency.  The proprietor has also feued ground to
the manufacturers and others, for building a house, and a
small garden at the back of it, at the rate of L. 4 per acre.
So that the village of Leuchars, in place of being literally
the village built with turfs, is become a neat country village
built with stones and mortar; the houses at least are com-
modious for manufacturers.  There are more than 70 new
houses built in this village, within a few years; 8 of them
have 2 floors, and 4 of them are covered with blue states.
