     PARISH OF RHYNIE AND ESSIE,

     (COUNTY OF ABERDEEN, SYNOD OF MORAY, PRESBYTERY
OF STRATHEOGIE).

     From Communications by the Rev. Mr James Milne.

     Name, etc.

   THE parishes of Rhynie and Essie were united at a re-
mote period.  The church of Essie was continued as
a place of worship till about 30 years ago, when it became
ruinous; since that time the parish has been generally
known by the name of Ryhnie only.  It is situated in the
county of Aberdeen, Synod of Moray, and Presbytery of
Strathbogie.  This presbytery was disjoined from the sy-
nod of Aberdeen, and annexed to that of Moray in 1700:
A disjunction the more remarkable, that several of the pa-
rishes were in the county of Aberdeen, and one of them,
Mortlich, was originally the seat of the bishoprick, which
was afterwards removed to Old Aberdeen.
