       PARISH OF OLDHAMSTOCKS.
PRESBYTERY OF DUNBAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE.
     THE REV. ROBERT MOORE, A. M. MINISTER. *

       I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

Name.-THE name of the parish is derived from the name of
the kirk town : and the ancient appellation of the village was
usually written in charters, Aldhamstoc and Aldhamstok. These
forms of the word are evidently derived from the Saxon Aldham,
the old habitation, and stoc, a place.
  Extent, &c.-This parish lies six miles east of the town of Dunbar.
It extends from the German Ocean on the east into Lammer-
muir and is bounded on the north and west by the parish of In-
nerwick; on the south by that of Cockburnspath. Its length from
north-east to south-west is about 6 English miles, and its breadth
from north-west to south-east from 2 to 3 miles.
   The face of the country presents a succession of little hills gra-
dually rising about each other, and receding from the shore.
   Soil.-The soil is generally sharp and dry; very fertile towards
the sea, but at a distance from the shore, barren and heathy. Some
account of the Geology of this parish will be found under the Go-
neral Observations on the County.
   There is a seam -of coal in the parish, but it has not been wrought.

			II.-CIVIL HISTORY.

   "The church of Oldharnstocks is ancient. In the ancient Tax-
atio, it was rated at the high value of 60 marks. In Bagimont's
Roll it was rated at L. 10. This church never belonged to any
monastery ; the patronage of the rectory seems to have continued,
with the lord of the manor, who cannot be easily traced on so
doubtful a frontier Oldhamstocks appears not among the manors
or baronies of Haddington constabulary in the tax-roll of 1613;
and from this circumstance we may infer that it had been long
