     Statistical Account

from 4 1/2 d. to 5 d. and 6 d. all Tron weight, within the
bounds of the presbytery of Kirkaldy.  The lower class use
no animal food, but live on meal, potatoes, milk and small
beer, with kail.-A common labourer earns 1 s. a-day.
Servants wages are of late greatly increased.  A man ser-
vant's wages for the plough and cart are from L. 5, 5 s. to
L. 7, 7 s. yearly.  Maid servants from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3.

   Miscellaneous Observation.-There is only one village
in this parish.-Toll-bars are lately erected.-Rent of land
varies with the soil and crops.  Some acres are let at 5 s.
each, others at 15 s and L. 1, 10 s.; and when let for lint-
feed or potatoes, at L. 3, L. 4, and L. 5.  There is a hill
called Goat-milk Hill, let 20 years ago at L. 25 for some
years past it rents at L. 120; it is 24 acres.  The rents of
farms are from L. 20 to L. 200, and the highest rent is for
the most part the cheapest bargain.  Twenty years ago,
few farms in this parish were inclosed; now every farm is
either inclosed in whole, or in part, to which the people
are now perfectly reconciled.-Civilization of manners has
made a little progress among farmers and the better sort
of inhabitants.  The lower class seem, in a great measure,
to retain the rough manners and barbarous customs of their
ancestors, while each vie with the other in expensive dress,
often above their station, or what they can seldom afford;
which may be occasioned by their  high wages, and reduced
prices of home manufactures, as well as a taste for that
species of luxury.
