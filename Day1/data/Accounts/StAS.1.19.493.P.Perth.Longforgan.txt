     of Longforgan.

   Some attempts have lately been made to introduce Jacob-
bine principles into this parish; but by care attention, and
proper exertion of the heritors, in support of the country
polic, it is hoped that the idle, the unprincipled, and ill-
disposed, will be effectually prevented from disturbing the
public peace; and that the good sense of the inhabitants in
general, who are loyal and well-disposed, will teach other
to put a proper value upon that most excellent Constitution
under which all enjoy so many blessings.

   Increase of Population.-That the inhabitants of the pa-
rish are in general upon the increase, when compared with
Dr Webster's return, has been already observed, notwith-
standing that several cottages, and one considerable village,
have been removed, to make room for larger farms.  It is
in the villages, however, that the addition has principally
taken place.  By a survey taken of the village of Long-
forgan in 1755, there were then only 105 families in it;
there are now 126.  Twenty-one families make 105 per-
sons at five a family, equal to nearly one-sixth of the whole
number.

   Fuel.-The fuel commonly used by the inhabitants of
this parish is coal, brought by water-carriage from the Frith
of Forth, and landed at Dundee, the burn-mouth of Inver-
gourie, or at Polgavie; the medium price used to be 4 s. per
boll, of 56 stone Amsterdam weight, that is, about 6 d. per
cwt; but within these few years the price has risen to
5 s and upwards.  This has introduced the use of English
coal from Newcastle and Sunderland, which are now
much liked, and by many thought better, and in the
end cheaper.  They also burn whins, (furz), and weedings
of firs, but their dependence is upon coal
