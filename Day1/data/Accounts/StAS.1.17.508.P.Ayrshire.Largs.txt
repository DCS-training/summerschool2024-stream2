   Air and Climate.-As the parish lies near the sea, and is sur-
rounded by very high hills, it has generally its full propor-
tion of rain, which is very serviceable to the light sandy soil,
of which the greatest part of the parish consists.
   The air at Largs is commonly pure.  The thick fogs
which often surround Glasgow, Paisley, and the adjacent
country, frequently cover the hills, but seldom visit the low
countries, in time of frost, this circumstance is peculiarly
remarkable, while in other places the air is thick and hazy,
here the sky is clear and serene.  Many of the sickly inha-
bitants of Glasgow and Paisley have felt sensible advantages
from the air of Largs; some of them have been entirely re-
covered, and yet the parish affords, comparatively, few in-
stances of longevity.
