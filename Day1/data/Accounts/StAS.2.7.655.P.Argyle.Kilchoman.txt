their farms more productive; but on the whole, there is great lack
of capital, industry, and enterprise among them.  One spirited
young man from Ayrshire entered lately into an extensive farm,
and has commenced with the most promising and encouraging
results,-furrow draining the strong clay land, which constitutes
the chief part of his arable.
   Fisheries.--During the summer and autumn, the people of Port-
nahaven occupy themselves in fishing cod, ling, and coal-fish,
which they cure and dispose of at a high rate, in the Irish market.
As every farm has its creek an its boats, a great quantity of fish
is taken for supporting their families; but, except at Portnahaven,
they do not fish for the market, nor even for the maintenance of
their own families, to the extent to which it might be carried. Be-
ing partly fishers and partly agriculturists, they pursue neither vo-
cation with proper energy.
   Produce.--The average gross amount and value of raw produce
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as
follows:

   There is an extensive distillery at Port- Charlotte, which, from
having passed through a number of hands for the last few years,
has not been kept in regular operation.
   The people manufacture cloth for their own use, though, from
the high price of wool, and the difficulty of procuring it, much
use is made of cotton fabrics by the working classes.

                  V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
  Villages.-There are three villages in the parish,-Portnaha-
ven, Port-Wyrmss, and Port-Charlotte. The first two are partly
fishing and partly agricultural villages; the latter is entirely agri-
cultural.
    Means of Cummunication.--There are twelve miles of a Parlia-
mentary line of road in the parish, and thirty-four miles of statute
labour road, all kept in a state of good repair.  With three excep-
tions, the public road passes through every farm in the parish.
