the west; and part of the shires of Renfrew, Lanark, and
Argyle, on the north.

   Natural Productions.-The moors and fields are pretty
well stocked with the usual kinds of game; but I have ne-
ver heard of any singular or uncommon plant or animal in
this parish; neither are there any lakes in it.  It abounds,
however, in peat, coal, lime-stone, iron-stone, and red free-
stone, all of a good quality.  Hard by Sorn Castle there is
likewise a beautiful kind of stone, of a blue-grey colour,
and of a close texture, which takes a polish little inferior to
that of marble, and is therefore admirably fitted for the pur-
pose of hearth-stones, pavements, steps of stairs, etc.  In a
deep glen, too, in the upper part of the parish, there are
symptoms of spar and lead-ore.  In the river of Ayr there
was abundance of fresh-water trout, and some salmon; but
it is here generally believed, that they have, of late, been
much diminished in their numbers, by the iron and tar
works of Muirkirk, and by the coal and lime works both
in that parish and the parish of Sorn.  Most of the springs
are, more or less, impregnated with iron; some of them
with lime, and some with sulphur; but, owing to the obscu-
rity of their situation, in this remote corner of the country,
none of them have hitherto attracted much attention.

   Soil and Climate.-As nearly as I can compute, without
actual measurement, this parish contains about 23,660 Eng-
lish acres; of which, about 3000 acres consist of moss; 7000
of hills, moors, and other pasture-lands; about 200 are co-
vered with wood, partly natural, and partly planted in belts
and clumps; and the remaining 13,460 are arable, though
not all at present in a state of actual cultivation.  The moss
is distributed through several pars of the parish, and is, for
