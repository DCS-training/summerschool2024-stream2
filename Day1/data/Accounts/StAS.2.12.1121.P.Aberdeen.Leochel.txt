presented to the Library of King's College, a very remarkable
roll, nearly twenty feet long, beautifully written in Sanscrit, and
containing an account of the Hindoo mythology, with grotesque
paintings of their gods. This is generally shown to visitors of the
college, as one of the curiosities; as well as another memorial
of the Cushnie family, a complete suit of mail, said to have been
worn by their ancestor at the battle of Harlaw in 1411.

is extant; and, except, in a few cases, it is only since 1822, that
the date of the births as well as of the baptisms has been entered.
    Antiquities-Cairns.-At one time these were numerous. Nine
are specified in the former account of Leochel; but in the pro-
gress of cultivation and building, most of them have disappeared.
A large one still remains, on the highest of several remarkable
indentations, rising the one above the other, from the Mill of Brux
towards the elevated ground of the farm of Corbanchory, and
looking like the steps of a gigantic stair.
    Ancient Coins.-About sixteen years ago, a gold coin, of the
    ABERDEEN.                                4 B
