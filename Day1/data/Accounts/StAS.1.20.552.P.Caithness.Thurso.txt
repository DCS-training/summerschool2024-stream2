     On the Northern Light-houses.

   It being a material question to the navigation of the northern parts of
Scotland, to have light houses erected in the fittest places, it was thought
proper to preserve, the following observations, by Captain John Dunnet
upon that interesting subject, transmitted in a letter to the Author, in
December 1792.

   "I beg leave to lay before you, the following piece of information, as to
the northern light-houses.  I have failed from Thurso, in the county of Caith-
ness, upwards of 25 years, and almost the whole of the above period, I have
had the command of a vessel.  By which means, it may be reasonably supposed,

Pentland Frith, either on the largest Pentland Skerry, near the coast of Ork-
ney, or on Duncansbay Head, on the coast of Caithness.  This light-house,
if built in a proper place, must prove highly beneficial to the numerous
vessels that passes and repasses through this well frequented channel.
   I am likewise informed, that the Pentland Skerry is the place pointed out
by several gentlemen, as the most proper spot to build the light house upon,
which surprisesme not a little, as, in my opinion, a light house built on
the Skerry, might be productive of bad consequences to strangers, and of no
real advantage to those who are well acquainted with the navigation of the
Pentland Frith.  For this I give the following reasons:
