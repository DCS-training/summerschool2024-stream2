enlivening extent of arable field, rising behind on either
hand; a luxuriant landscpe, spread westward on the wind-
ing banks of the Fiddich, glittering through the meadows
and woods, decorated by the steady battlements of the castles
of Balvenie and Auchendown, each on its own green hill,
and terminated by the summits of the blue mountains, ranged
at a distance around, seeming to debar all irruption upon the
sequestered vales.  It bore little resemblance to the other
castles of the feudal lords, whose towers or square or round,
of various heights and form, projected for the protection of
the intermediate walls.  It appears to have been a simple
structre of an 119 by 24 feet within, divided by an internal
wall, so as to form two halls on the ground floor, one 65,
and the other 54 feet in length.  The windows were only
20 inches wide, though the walls were 8 feet thick, built up
in frames of timber, for keeping in the fluid mortar which
was poured into the dry stone-wall, when raised to a certain
height.  The front and corners were neatly finished with
free-stone from the quarries of Duffus, at the distance of 20
miles, on the other side of Spey, the nearest where such
stone could have been procured.  The front and gables are
now entirely broken down; but, within these 50 years, they
stood to the height of several stories.  About that period,
several silver spoons were found among the rubbish, having
the handle round, and hollow like a pipe; and the concave
part, or shell, perfectfly circular.
   This bulky fabric, which on the eastern front had lower
external accommodations, in the year 1200 was denominated
Castellum de Bucharin.  It then belonged to the Freskyns
of Duffus, by whom it was no doubt built.  By assuming the
title De Moravia, from their connection with that country,
they became the author of that sirname.  They were once
possessed of many a fair domain in the north, namely, Duffus,
