     General Appendix to [Vol. vi.

   Two anecdotes will illustrate how tenacious some are of
life, and with what indifference others contemplate death.-
A neighbour endeavoured to comfort Margaret Cruickshank,
when in the 99th year of her age, for the loss of a daughter
with whom she had long resided, by observing that in the
course of nature she could not long survive.  'Aye,' said
the good old woman with pointed indignation, 'what Fye
'token do ye see about me?'
   James Mackie, by trade a wright, was asked by a neigh-
bour for what purpose he had bought some fine deal that he
observed in his barn.  'It is timber for my coffin,' quoth
James.  'Sure,' replies the neighbour, 'you mean not to
'make your own coffin.  You have neither resolution nor
'ability for the talk.'  'Hout away, man,' says James,
'if I were ance begun, I'll soon ca't by hand.'-The hand,
but not the heart, failed him, and he left the task of making
the coffin to a younger operator.

   Population.-In 1796, the number of souls in Monquhit-
