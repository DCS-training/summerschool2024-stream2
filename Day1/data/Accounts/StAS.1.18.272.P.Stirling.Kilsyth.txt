     Statistical Account

   I shall therefore endeavour to make an allowance for this
in the following calculation.
   For tLe first 10 years after the Revolution, the average of
 births annually, was about 40.

<TABLE>

Multiply this No.         40 by 30   the No. of inhabts. 1200
For the second 10 years   47 by 30                       1410
For the third             51 by 30                       1530
For the fourth            60 by 30                       1800
For the fifth less*       57 by 35                       1995
For the sixth less        54 by 35                       1890
For the seventh           56 by 35                       1960
For the eighth            55 by 35                       1925
For the ninth+            67 by 36                       2412
For the tenth             59 by 38                       2242
For the last 6 years      64 by 38                       2432

   Here it will appear, that I have made an allowance for still
born and unbaptised infants, even at the earliest period.  In
place of 26, I have taken 30, allowing 4 annually.  After the
secession, I have allowed 5 more annually, which I think
may be a reasonable allowance for those of that persuasion,
who neglected to registrate their children.  After the relief so-
ciety was established here, a few more would neglect to do so:
especially considering the duty on baptisms; therefore, I have
from that period allowed 3 more.
   After much minute investigation, I suppose the above
may give a pretty accurate idea of the progressive increase of
population.
   Mr Robe mentions in his narrative, that there were
in the year 1742, 200 communicants in this parish.  At pre-
sent there are no less than 515 in full communion with the
church.
