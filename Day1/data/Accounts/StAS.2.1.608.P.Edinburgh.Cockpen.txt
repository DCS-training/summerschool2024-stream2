to the present time. It has been, for many years past, most care-
fully attended to.
   Modern Buildings.-In the year 1816, a new manse was built
by the heritors; and in 1820, an elegant new church, in its im-
mediate neighbourhood; both most conveniently situated in the
centre of the parish.
   Mansion-Houses.-There are no mansion-houses in the parish,
except Dalhousie Castle and Hillhead. Lord Dalhousie, more
than fifty years ago, purchased the old mansion-house and farm
of Cockpen, from Baron Cockburn.
   Mills.-There are two mills, manufactories of flax-yarn and
paper, the former at Prestonholm, on the South Esk, and the
latter at St Leonard's, in the immediate neighbourhood of Lass-
wade on the North Esk.
                        III.-POPULATION.
   It is stated in the former Account, that, "by a list, found among
the papers of the then incumbent, it appears that, in 1749, there
were in the parish 160 families, containing 229 males and 349
females or 648 individuals; of which 454 were above, and 194
under ten years of age. The return to Dr Webster was 640
souls." It is added, that, in 1790, there were 288 families, and
1123 individuals. By the census of 1811, the population was
2000; but in 1821, it was 75 short of that number, owing pro-
bably to the removal of some colliers.
   Soon, however, after, that period, Mr Craig, proprietor of the
flax-mill at Prestonholm, brought about 200 additional hands to
his work, which raised the number in the parish above 2000.
But on the burning of the same mill, which unfortunately happen-
ed on the 27th of February 1827, 567 persons left the parish.
In 1814, there were in the parish 382 families, and 1760 in-
dividuals, of whom 796 were males, 972 females; 319 under
seven years of age, and 20 above seventy. The average number
of births for the last seven years has been 50, and of marriages 18.
No register of the deaths has been kept.
   By the census, of 1841, there were 505 families, and a popula-
tion of 2345, which has been considerably increased since that
year.
                        IV.-INDUSTRY.
   There are at present in the parish 10 farmers who keep ser-
vants and cottars under them. The number of these farm-ser-
vants and cottars is 100. There are 10 persons engaged in re-
