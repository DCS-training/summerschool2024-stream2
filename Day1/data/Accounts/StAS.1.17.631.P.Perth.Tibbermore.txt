     NUMBER XLIV.

     PARISH OF TIBBERMUIR.

     (PRESBYTERY AND COUNTY OF PERTH.-SYNOD OF
     PERTH AND STIRLING).

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN INGLIS, Minister.

     Name.

   AMONG strangers, and in the common almanacks of
the country, the name of this parish is Tippermuir;
but the orthography adopted in the title, which is universally
in use among the inhabitants, is abundantly justified by an-
cient writings, and the probable etymology of the name.
In a charter granted to the monastery of Scone, in the reign
of William the Lion*, it is written with the Latin termina-
tion Tibbirmora; and in Fordun's History of Scotland, it
is Tybirmore- Conformably to this ancient orthography, the
name is understood to be compounded of two Gaelic words,
tuber and more, which signify a large well, referring probably
to a plentiful spring of water immediately adjoining to the
church-yard.

   Extent, Situation, and Surface.-The parish is, from east to
west, about 6 miles long; and its breadth varies from one to
three miles.  It is bounded on the east by the parish of Perth;
