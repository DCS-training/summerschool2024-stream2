   Church, Stipend, School, Poor.-Sir Thomas Dundas is pa-
tron of this parish.  All the inhabitants are of the Established
Church of Scotland.  There have been two churches in this
parish, each of them near to the middle of it, one on the E.

great distance from their place of worship.  But by the best account that can
be taken, they amount on an average to 50.  A register of deaths has not yet
been attempted to be kept, because of the many burial places in the parish, and 
the many accidents by sea.
