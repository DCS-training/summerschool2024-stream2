the 26th of August; but, on account of the frost in the win-
ter, of the quantities of rain, which, by falling in the hills
where the river has its sources, keep it too high to admit of
hauling the ners, there is generally no regular fishing till the
springs is well advanced. Though there are cruives* on the
river, the water runs above them in the almost incessant
floods which happen previous to that: and most of the
fish getting over the dyke+, a great number is seldom caught
in the chief before March or April.  When sold to the
people of the country, 2 d. a pound is the usual price of the
fresh fish throughout the season.

   There is belonging to the public good of Dingwall, a stell
salmon fishery on Conan, or a fishery on that part of the
river into which the hallows.  Five and twenty years ago,
it brought no rent, but is now let at L. 18: 10 per annum.

   Sea.-The sea, at high water, washes a considerable part of
the parish, running in apparent can be, in several directions,
along the side of the town, and forms a beautiful variety of
islets and perrenials.  But, even in this state, it is very shal-
low for several miles down the frith; and, at low water,
it recedes to the distance of near four miles, leaving nothing
but a sunny sirand, which makes it unfit for the navigation,
of any large vessel, adverse to the production of fish of al-
most any land, slounders excepted, and barren of all object,
which merit the attention of the natural, the farmer, or
the particular.

   The goods imported to that place from London, Glasgow,
Leith, and other manufacturing and trading towns are car-
rie in the London and Leith smacks, which maintain a
constant communication every three weeks or month at
