and will be found perhaps to approach the truth as nearly as the
nature of the case will admit.

   Manufactures.-Kelp was the only article manufactured in the
parish, and this unfortunately is now at an end, in consequence of
the free importation of barilla.  There used to be about 30 per-
sons, chiefly women, employed here for eight weeks in the year,
it 1s. per diem each, and about 20 tons of kelp was annually made
and sold.  The rent of the kelp shore used formerly to average
L.50 per annum, and is now gone.
   Navigation.-Number of boats from St Combs employed in
the herring fishery, 13; and perhaps as many smaller boats for
ordinary white-fishing,

   Market-Town.-The nearest market-town is Fraserburgh, four

<FOOTNOTE>Oats of 1st quality, 19s. adding 6d. additional for bear grown, of which the real
average price is 22s. per boll; 2d quality of oats fiar prices.
          This total value exceeds what is realised, as the writer finds, on more extensive
inquiry, something should be set down for wasted and lost; but the rent being, as per
common computation, one-third, L. 5500 X 3 = L. 16,500; (L.18,000 may be
near the truth.)-Jan. 1840.
