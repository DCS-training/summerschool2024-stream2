the Royal Commission. Of the population of 621 near Patna
580 profess to be of the Established Church.
    In March 1836, the population of Straiton parish was ascer-
tained to be 1417. There were 289 families, of whom 280 were
of the Established Church, and 9 of other denominations. Of
the whole population 1383 were of the Established Church, and
34 of other bodies of Christians. But the number of commu-
nicants appears to be the correct method of fixing the religious
professions of the people. The communicants of the Established
Church were 642; of the United Secession 11; of the Reformed
Presbytery 2; of the Roman Catholic 3; and of three other bo-
dies one each. In the number of Dissenters only six live within
four miles of Straiton. Several families living on the higher banks
of the Doon, attend Dalmellington church. The attendance at
church in summer is good. There are only 800 souls within the
distance of four miles from church. The average number of
young communicants for the last three years has been 31, and
the number joining in communion 570.
     The church collections have gradually increased from the time
to which the account extends till the present time. The yearly
average amount for five years preceding 1710, was L.9; 1790,
L.24; 1825, L.31 ; 1837, L.37. For other purposes the collec-
tions have averaged L.5 yearly.
     The ministers of Straiton prior to the reign of Charles I. can-
not be ascertained. Mr David M'Quorne, and Mr George Mich
preceded the Revolution. Since that time the ordinations have
been:--1690, Mr Alexander Kennedy; 19th Sep. 1738, Mr
Robert Walker; 3d August 1749, Mr John M'Dermont Fer-
gushill; 21st April 1791, Dr William Crawford; 1st May 1817,
Mr John Paul; 22d April 1824, the present incumbent.
     Mr Walker was translated to Leith and Edinburgh, and has
left a durable monument of his talents and piety in his admirable
sermons. Dr Crawford became Professor of Moral Philosophy
at St Andrews. Mr Paul is now one of the ministers of St Cuth-
berts, Edinburgh.
    Education.--There are two parochial schools, at which all the
usual branches are taught. The Straiton schoolmaster has a
salary of L.31, 10s. the legal accommodation, and fees amounting
to L.32. The Patna teacher has a salary of L.11, a house and
school-house from the proprietor, and fees varying from L.20 to
L.25. The charge for reading is 3s. and for other branches a
