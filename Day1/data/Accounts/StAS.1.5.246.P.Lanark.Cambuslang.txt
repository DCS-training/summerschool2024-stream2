     Statistical Account

   State of Property.-On the supposition, that the parish
contains 8 square miles in superficial extent, there are, on
the whole, about 4032 Scotch acres; and allowing 232
acres for braes, planting, roads, and waste ground, there
remain 3800 acres of arable land.  The rate of arable
land is from 10 s. to 40 s. per acre; but the average rate
of land does not exceed 15 s. per acre.  Now 3800 acres,
at 15 s. per acre, amount to L.2850, which is about the
present rental.  The property of the parish is divided a-
mong 11 heritors.  His Grace the Duke of Hamilton, to
whom about two thirds of it belongs, may be considered
as the only non-residing heritor.  Three others, indeed,
dwell within the confines of neighbouring parishes; but
are so very near this parish, that they farm part of their
own lands in it.  Below is a state of the number of acres
belonging to the several heritors, with their valued rent,
and also their real rent, estimating the land which the re-
siding heritors possess, at the ordinary rate of such land in
the neighbourhood.

ed at 8 o'clock in the morning, and 10 o'clock at night; and the Ther-
mometer, not only at these times, but also at 2 o'clock afternoon; so that
columns first and fourth,express the mean height between these extremes
of the day.
