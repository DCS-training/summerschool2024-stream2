     Name, Situation, Extent, etc.

   THIS parish in general, and more particularly that part

parishes in that part of the country, unconnected with any 
particular synod.  It extends, from north to south, about 6
miles along the sea coast, and is no where above a mile in
breadth.  On the east and north-east, it is bounded by the
sea, which separates it from the island and parish of Brassa,
and forms that excellent harbour commonly called Brassa
Sound.

mountains, is generally peat or moss, and is deep to their
very summit.  The arable land lies in spots along the sea
coast; the soil is light and sandy, but as fertile and productive
