thian hills, the east coast of Fife, and the entries into the
Frith of Forth, and the river Tay.  The prospect towards
the north is bounded by the Grampian Hills.  Few places
equal it in point of situation.  It is governed by a provost,
two bailies, and 16 counsellors.  The dean of guild and
deacon convener of the trades are members of council ex
officio.  Besides the town-clerk, there are 5 writers, who are
notaries public, and 2 messengers at arms.  The revenue of

are 7 trades incorporated; smiths, glovers, taylors, weavers,
