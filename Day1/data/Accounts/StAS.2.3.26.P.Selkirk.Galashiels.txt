may be added, that there is no want of schools in the parish.
     Libraries, &c.--There are two subscription libraries; one of con-
siderable extent, instituted in 1797, and containing 1600 volumes;
the other, as yet small, but Well selected, and of excellent use, be-
longing to the Sabbath school,which has long been conducted by
the Secession minister of this place.  There is one public read-
ing-room in the town; and a small printing-office, for no larger
publications than hand-bills and advertisements.
     Savings Bank, &c.--One of these was established in 1815, but
as it belongs to the district including part of several surrounding
parishes, no notice strictly parochial can be given.  As the main
thing, however, is to trace the fluctuations or the progress of such
institutions, the followling, tabular statement may not be uninte-
resting.

ber of members at any period was 270 ; at present they are redu-
ced to 200.  The quaterly payment in support of the funds is Is.,
and the relief afforded has varied from 3s. to 5s. per week.  At this
time 3s. are allowed to the sick,and only 2s. to such as received a                                   It

average allowance to each of the enrolled poor is 6s. 6d.per month;
but of those receiving interim supply the average allowance cau-

occasional donations, may amount to L. 25 per annum.  Of this

suffer from sickness or other distress, and are not on the list of the
