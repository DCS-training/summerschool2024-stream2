much expence in repairs and improvements on what they
already consider as a dead stock.  To carry on this busi-
ness with advantage, the field should be let to an intelli-
gent bleacher, or the property thrown into the hands of
one or two proprietors who might find their account in su-
perintending it.
   Of late, however, it is said, that owing to the good ma-
nagement of the present bleacher, the business has been up-
on the increase.  From his statement, it appears, that in
the year 1787 there were whitened 715 pieces of linen;
in 1788-855; in 1789-917; in 1790-1202; in 1791-
1232.  This cloth does not all belong to the parish, but is
taken in from different parts of the country.
   The woollen manufacture has of late been making consi-
derable progress, especially in the neighbourhood of Gala-
shiels, for which see the Statistical Account of that parish,
Vol. II. p. 299.  Besides what is done by them, there are
manufactured annually in Gattonside and Melrose, at an a-
verage, about 282 stone of wool, the cloth of which may
yield about L. 1041.  Since November 1791, several
looms, both here and in the neighbouring parishes, have
been employed in weaving cottons.  In addition to those
employed by the manufacturers near Galashiels, there are
80 looms in the parish; 20 of which are employed in
weaving cotton, 30 in woollen, and 30 in linen-work.  Du-
ring the summer, when the demand is greatest, some of the
woollen looms are employed in weaving linen; but as cot-
ton is found both more cleanly and more profitable than
either woollen or linen, it is probable, that should the de-
mand for it continue, the number of weavers employed
in that line will gradually increase.
