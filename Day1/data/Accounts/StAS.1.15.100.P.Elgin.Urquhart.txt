     Statistical Account

much to be wished, that they were either driven back to their
antient habitation, or utterly exterminated.  The last mea-
sure has been successfully followed by a worthy nobleman in
the western part of this county, celebrated for his extensive
and flourishing plantations, who kept hounds for the sole
purpose of extirpating those destructive animals.  I need
hardly say that the nobleman I mean is the Earl of MORAY.
If these plantations have attracted the deer to this corner, it
has been remarked that they have not been favourable to
the increase of hares and patridges: this may be owing to
the protection which they afford to beasts and birds of prey.
Were gentleman to give small premiums for the destruction
of these vermin, it would prove more effectual in preserving
the game and increasing its numbers, than all the game laws
that ever were, or ever will be enacted,

   Church, School, and Poor.-The present incumbent, who is
a bachelor, had his presentation from the Duke of Gordon
but the patronage of the church has since been conveyed
to the Earl of Fife, at the time that that exchange of lands
took place between his Lordship and the family of Go-don.
The stipend, by a decree obtained February 1793, is 8 chal-
ders victual and 40 L. Sterling, including 5 L. for communion
elements.  The glebe consists of 5 Scotch acres.  Some
years age, the minister entered into a contract with the heri-
tors, for keeping the manse and offices in repair during his
incumbency, for which he receives an annuity of 15 L. Ster-
ling, besides 30 L. paid per advance.  The church was com-
pletely repaired about 18 years ago.-A new school-house
was then built; the school-master's salary is 12 bolls of oat
meal, and 6 bolls of barley.-The average number of poor in
this parish is about 20.  The funds for their support arise
from the weekly collections at church, which amount to 10 L.
