   Quadrupeds, Birds, etc.-Of indigenous animals there
are none peculiar to this place.  In Lord Fife's park are se-
veral varieties of the deer; and the pheasant is found wild
in many of the adjoining woods.
   A maccaw, celebrated for its beautiful plumage, was
brought from the West Indies in 1756, and lived 27 years
at Duff House.  His vigour was not impaired, when, in
1784, he was killed by some animal unknown.
   In Mr Condiner's late publication of "Singular Subjects of
" Natural History," are engraved some beautiful specimens
of coralline and polypus, found off the coast of Banff.  He
has annexed particular descriptions of each.
