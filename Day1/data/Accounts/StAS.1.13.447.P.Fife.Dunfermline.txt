God's will is not so, bot that ze sal be zervit be the ministerie of men,
it behouvis zow to tak thame as thay ar, with all thingis yt. of necessitie
belangis unto thame, or lawfully dependis on thamem, sic as are wyfes,
childre and familie, quhilk not only must be honestly reulit, and the
children haldin under obedience with all honestie, (as Paul teachis), bot

principallie zow maist nobill and worthie personages, to pret thir thingis
in zour myndis to zour profite, to susffer the wordis of exhortation pa-

fumquhat rudely and schairply utterit, considdering that it procedit from
the hart of him that luisis and savouris baith zow and zowr caus, rememb-

the woundis of a lufer mair faithfull then the kissis of ane enemie thocht
they be pletat.....-The following note is added to the sermon:
