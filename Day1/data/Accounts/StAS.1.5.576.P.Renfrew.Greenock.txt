superior, Sir John Shaw, and for the above purpose, a vo-
luntary assessment of 1 s. 4 d. Sterling, was laid on each
sack of malt brewed into ale within the limits of the town.
In consequence of this, the harbour was begun in 1707.
Within two circular quays, (a mid quay or tongue inter-
vening, consisting of above 2000 feet of stone), are enclosed
more than ten acres.  The expence was upwards of
100,000 merks.  Alarmed by the greatness of the debt in-
curred, on Sir John Shaw's agreeing to take it upon him,
they resigned to him the harbour and asssessment above
mentioned.  After the Union, however, the trade of the
port increased so rapidly, that, in the year 1740, the whole
debt was extinguished, and there remained a surplus, the
foundation of the present town's funds, of 27,000
merks*.

   The fund, arising from the harbour, in 1783, was
L. 111:4:8; in 1792, L. 812, 9 s.  The other funds of
the town are the rents of warehouses and markets, the sur-
plus of seat rents in the New Church, after paying the
minister's stipend; and a water tax of 2 1/2 per cent. on the
rents of houses above 40 s.  The whole funds of the town
last year, all expenses being defrayed, were L. 1100 Ster-
ling.

<FOOTNOTE>

*It may seem strange, at this time, that the above tax on malt should
have produced a fund for executing a work of such magnitude and ex-
pence; but surprise ceases, when it is considered, that at that time, and a
good while after, ale was the only drink of the labouring people.  De-
voutly is it wished, by those who painfully observe the permicious effects
of spirituous liquors, on the constitutions and morals of the people, that
it had still continued to be so.  The quantity of these not very slow poi-
sons, annually consumed in Greenock, is almost incredible.  For retailing
them in the year 1792, the number of licenses granted in Greenock only,
exclusive of the village of Cartsdike, is 247.
