     PARISH OF GAMRIE.

     By the Rev. Mr WILSON.

     Origin of the Name.

   IT has long been a general report, and the prevailing tra-
dition in this country, that, some time before the year
1004, in which the church of Gamrie is said to have been
built, (and there is at this day the date 1004 on the steeple),
that the Thane of Buchan pursued the Danes to the precipice
or brow of the hill above the church, and there defeated them
with great slaughter.  Several of their skulls (most likely of
their chiefs who had fallen in battle) were built into the
church wall, where they remain entire:  From hence it came
to be called by some the Kirk of Sculls.  In the Gaelic lan-
guage, the word Kemri, from which, probably, Gamrie is de-
rived, signifies running step, or running leap.  And this deri-
vation seems a natural one; because, from the situation of
the hill, which is one of the highest on this part of the coast,
and very steep on one side, it must have been a running skir-
mish, and very fatal to the vanquished.  In some old regis-
ters, the name of the parish is written Ghaemrie.  On the
said eminence, above the kirk of Gamrie, at the east end of
one of the most level and extensive plains in Buchan, are a
number of vestiges of encampments, which at this day are
called by the name of bloody pots, or bloody pits.
