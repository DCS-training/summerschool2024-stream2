is still very perfect, is 7 feet high on the outside, and 4 feet wide
on the top. There seem to have been three entrances to the
camp, nearlytrisecting the encircling rampart, but of these the ap-
proach from the northwest was the principal, leading directly to
the proetnrium or general's tent, the position of which is still
marked by a slight elevation of the ground on which it was pitched.
About thirty years ago, a Roman vase, of elegant form and exqui-
site workmanship, was found by the late minister of the parish, in
preparing for the foundation of an addition to the house on his
property at Woodend, and is now in the possession of the Hunterian
Museum of Glaggow: but, in so far as the writer has discovered,
this is the only existing specimen of Italian manufacture left
by the Roman soldiers during their sojourn in this parish. To
the south-west of the eminence on which the remains of the Ro-
man encampment are to be seen, and nearly on the ridge of the
same long hill, whose other elevated extremity is crowned by
Langside House, stands the village of Langside, rendered ever me-
rnorable iii Scottish history, by the fatal day when the lovely but
ill-starred Mary appeared for the last time as a queen and a free
woman. A sufficiently accurate detail, to which tradition now can
add nothing, of the battle fought on that eventful day, the 13th
of May 1568, fraught with so many real blessings to Scotlandi
-yet even now contemplated with mixed feeling, of pleasure and
of pain by every leal-bearted Scotsman, is given by every writer
of Scottish history, and the minute discrepancies which appear in
their several narratives would not probably have existed, had they
been better acquainted with the localities of the scene of action.
The writer has no intention to describe the battle, but, as modern
innovation is ever removing ancient landmarks, it way be well to
record a short account of the field as it existed when the battle
was fought, according to his best judgment formed on the spot,
with the various authors in his hand, elucidated by traditionary
report of the nature of the old roads leading through the parish,
and of the general condition of the gropnd. The high road from
Hamilton to Dumbarton either passed through Glasgow, crossing
the Clyde at a ford near-Dalmarnock, which was the way the Re-
gent expected the Queen to take when,on the morning of the 3th,
be drew up his troops at Barrowfield to meet her; or through Ru-
therglen,-enterina, this parish at Hagginsbaw,-passin along the
ridge of the hill 'now known as Mount Floridon,-then coinciding
with the road from Glasgow to Ayr, which wound round- thesotith
