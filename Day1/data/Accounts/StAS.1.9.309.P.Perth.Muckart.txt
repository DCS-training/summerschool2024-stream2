mantic scene.-A little higher up is the De'il's Mill, a
name taken from the similarity there is between the place
and a grinding mill.  Here the river, after running by a
quick descent, between rocks in a narrow course for some
time comes into a kind of baron formed in the rock; out
of which the water falls about 14 or 15 feet among the
stones, making a dreadful noise, resembling the noise of the
happer and clap of a mill.  There are several conjec-
tures about what is the cause of the clap that is heard.
Some think it is occasioned by the river's falling on a large
stone suspended between the rocks, and striking against
them by means of the force of the waters; others, that it
is owing to the air's being carried down by the falling of
the water into a vacuity below the rocks, and causing a
clap, by regularly bursting out as it is condensed.
The Cauldron Linn, which is about a mile below the
Rumbling Bridge, exhibits a still more romantic scene.
At a distance is heard the noise of the falls of water, and
of the river running by a quick descent among the stones
with great rapidity, in a confined course, through which it
has to force its passage.  The noise increases as you come
nearer to the place, which you do not see till you are upon
it.  The first thing that strikes the eye, are the high rocks
on the sides of the river, through which it appears to have
worn its way.  These rocks are some of them perpendicu-
lar, and others project over the river and almost meet.
They are on both sides nearly of an equal height, and on a
level; but as there are two cascades, they are much higher
from the surface of the water below the second cascade,
and even above it, than they are from the surface of the
water above the first.  At the first cascade, the river, after
a short fall, lights on rock hollowed in a curious wonderful
manner, into deep cavities of different forms and sizes;
most of which are of a cylindric form, open on one side,
