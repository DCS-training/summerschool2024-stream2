avoutly acknowledged.  Their respect and regard for their pastor
is unbounded.* During the long period that the former clergy-
man, and, since his death, the present incumbent have been minis-
ters of Fordoun, they have reason to be proud of the support re-
ceived from all classes in the discharge of their duties, and, as a
proof of their success, it may here be stated, that in 1801, there
were 257 Dissenters in the parish,--at present the whole Dis-
senters of every description are reduced to 89, of whom only 8
are Seceders.
	A marked alteration has taken place in the reading habits of
the people. For the histories of Wallace and Bruce, of Robin
Hood and Little John, George Buchanan, Jack the Giant-killer,
Leper the Tailor, and many other worthies that formerly amused
the inmates of the smithy, the cottage and farm-kitchen, books of
history, travels, voyages, biography, agriculture, and, above all,
books on religious subjects, are now substituted. The parish li-
brary furnishes an ample store of these, and the number of readers
who apply for books, especially in the winter season, is very great.
	Smuggling is now happily unknown, nor, as in some other dis-
tricts, has poaching been substituted for it.

<FOOTNOTE>Their regard for their former pastor, and for his son, their present pastor, has
been uniform and steady. It was deeply felt by their former pastor, and is no less
gratefully and sensibly felt by the present incumbent, who has laboured among them
with great comfort for many years, and who delights in his old age, to recollect and
recount all their kindness and attention to him and his father.--Note by Dr Leslie.
