It is stated in the former Statistical Account, that the soil is
194 adapted chiefly for oats and barley;" but there is now raised
more value of wheat than barley, and the quality is excellent. The
afiars for wheat were first struck in 1649, as appears by the Sheriff-
Court books of Fife; and that year, the boll of wheat was so high-
priced as L. 1, Os. lid. Sterling. The Chevalier barley, as well
as the common kinti, is in general use ; but though estimable
for its great weight, it is costly, by requiring a rich soil, and
hazardous in late seasons, requiring six weeks longer to mature
after sowing than ordinary barley. In 1643, by the Fife fiars, a
boll of 11 bear" was 10s. Sterlini. Several sorts of oats, as the
Drummond and Tartar kind, are tried. The poL-Lw oats, from
their speedy arrival. at maturity, bid fair to be preferable. The
boR of 11 aits and meall," by the Fife fiars in 1643, was 89. 4d.
Sterling. Flax is nearly discontinued in the parish, and'will be
so generally, when calcareous manures are introduced. Cotton, too,
in many respects, supplies the use of flax at a much cheaper rate;
