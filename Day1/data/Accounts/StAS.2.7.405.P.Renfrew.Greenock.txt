              I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HiSTORY.

        Nale, Boundaries, &C.-GREENOCK, originally one parish, de-
     rives its name from the estate on which the old church was built,
     when the parish was disjoined from Inverkip in 1592.  That estate,
     it can scarcely be doubted, received its name from the: Castle of
     Wester Greenock, the mansion of the proprietor at whose sol'
     tation the parish was disjoined or erected ; or, to speak more cor_.
     rectly, from the bill or rising ground on which the castle was built
     The word appears to be Celtic, and, perhaps;, is compounded of
     two Gaelic words,--Grian, signifying the sun, and cnoc, signifying
     a bill  in composition Grian-chnoc, the hill of the sun, or the funny
     hill.  If this conjecture be well founded, the name is peculiarly
     appropriate to the site of the - Castle of Wester Greenock, while
     is never thrown into the sbade at any hour of the dav. and is strike..
