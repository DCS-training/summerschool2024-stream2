there is an almost hourly communication.  The fish wives
will rather take their chance of a market in that city, than
fell their fish at a reasonable price here; insomuch, that 
the people of this parish are chiefly supplied by women
from Prestonpans, who are too distant to go and return
with their burdens daily to Edinburgh; and who, when
they have not fish from their own boats, are glad to pur- 
chase them when they can get them at Fisherrow, and di- 
stribute them among the opulent families here.  Nortwith-
standing all this, fish was long a cheap article here, till 
the demand at Edinburgh increased, and the haddocks left 
our coasts about six or seven years ago.  Fortunately they
have again returned in small numbers about the time of 
drawng up this account, namely in June 1703.  The only
article we have cheaper than at Edinburgh is coals, which
is owing to out vicinity to the pits; and the only articles 
we have, perhaps, of better quality, are the produce of 
the garden and bread.  This last advantage we owe to our
lying between Edinburgh, and the best wheat farms in
East Lothian, from whence our bakers are supplied.  The
bakers here, about 50 or 60 years ago, more than half fur- 
nished Edinburgh and Leith with wheat bread, and still
continue to vend a considerable quantity there, notwith-
standing their paying higher mill dues than are paid any 
where else; but they have cheaper houses and firing than
can be had in the city, which more than compensates them
for the high price of mealing.  It must be observed, how-

   not likely to abuse such a privilege, it may well be presumed that occa-
sional access to the theatre, especially when the most eminent actors have 
appeared, has contributed to improve their style and pronunciation, and 
to banish from the pulpit that rustic vulgarity with which it was once 
reproached.
