by the increase of accommodation, which it was proposed to pro-
vide in the docks,-while a very serious addition would be made
to the debt by which the harbour funds are already encumbered.
   Shipping, Ship-buildinq, and Trade.-Ship-building is carried
on in Aberdeen by several firms,with considerable spirit, as the
subjoined table of the vessels and tonnage built here for the last
seven years will evince:

Within the last year, the building of iron vessels has been com-
menced in this port, and a very large one of this description is
now nearly ready for being launched.
   In 1836, the harbour trustees furnished a patent slip for hauling
up vessels requiring repair.  The cost of this was L.3337.  It
has been extensively employed, and the sums paid for its use will
abundantly compensate for the expense incurred in procuring it,
while great facility is thus given to the repair of vessels. -
   The number of vessels and the amount of their tonnage, regis-
tered as belonging to the port of Aberdeen for the last seven
years is as follows:

   The introduction of steam navigation at Aberdeen took place
in 1821, when the Velocity of 256 tons burthen, and furnished
with two engines of 110 horses' power, began to ply between Aber-
deen and Leith.  Another vessel was soon after put into the same
trade, and more recently, other two with more powerful engines
were added, and these now run during the greater part of the year
between Leith and Aberdeen, making also stated voyages to Ler-
wick and Kirkwall, and to Wick and Inverness.  The amount of
steam power at present employed in this trade is 640 horses'
power, and the tonnage of the vessels is 1360 tons.
   In 1827, a steamer of larger size than any of these, the
Queen of Scotland, of 550 tons, began to ply between Lon-
don and Aberdeen, and soon after, another was put, into the
same trade.  A third, still larger, was more recently added,
and an opposition having been attempted by another company,
a junction was won after affected, in consequence of which a
fourth steamer was employed.  These vessels sail weekly from
Aberdeen and London; but it is cause of regret to many that the
