tent of 139. This increase may be ascribed to the recent acces-
sion made to the villages of Glenfoot and Abernethy; but chiefly
to the establishment of a bleachfield at Clunie, in the eastern part
of the parish.  Of the population about 1100 reside in the vil-
lages of Abernethy, Glenfoot, and Aberargie, and the remainder
are scattered over the landward part of the parish, which is ex-
tensive.
  The comparative state of the population, &c. in 1831 and 1841
is exhibited in the following certified extract:

    In the villages by far the greater proportion of the inhabitants,
both male and female, are employed in weaving linen yarn.  During
the fishing season on the Earn and Tay about 70 individuals are
engaged in the salmon-fishery, a great proportion of whom have
recourse to the loom during the winter months.
