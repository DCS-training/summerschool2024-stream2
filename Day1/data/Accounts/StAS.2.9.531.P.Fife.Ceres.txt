Poor and Parochial Funds.-Besides the usual funds for the poor
which arise from collections at the church, and from dues on mar-
ridges, &c. there is the rent of three acres which were left to the ses-
sion, and also the interest of L. 460, which was left by the late
Miss Halkerston of Carskardo. Originally, this sum was L. 500,
but the necessary expenses on legacies have reduced it to L.460.
It is lent out at 4 per cent. There is no regular assessment
But the heritors, every year, make a voluntary assessment, so as to
meet all deficiencies in the other sources. The church collection
may amount to L. 60 per annum, There is a great deal of
money expended for the good of the poor in a private way,
by benevolent individuals who reside in the parish. This private
charity falls of course, verv heavily on the few heritors who reside
in the parish, and to whom. frequent applications are made. A
certain quantity of coals and meal is annually distributed among
the poors at the private expense off same of the heritors. The
average number of poor oh the roll is 50, and the yearly expen-
diture is about L.120.
   Fuel.-There is an abundant supply of good Scotch coal in the
neighbourhood; and in common seasons coal is the cheapest fuel.
   Inns.-The number of inns may be about 25. Their corrupt-
ing influence has not hitherto been very general.
