     Statistical Account

   Climate and Diseases.-The country is inland, and consider-
ably above the level of the sea.  The winters, therefore, are
often pretty severe, and the work of the spring is sometimes
retarded by the long continuance of frost and snow; yet the
harvest is not later here than in most other parts of the court-
ty.  Owing to the vicinity of high hills, thunder, and partial
showers of rain, are pretty frequent in summer.  Fogs are
often seen resting upon the river, and some part of the low
grounds, in the nights of July and August; the corn, how-
ever, if sowed in proper season, is seldom materially injured
by frost or mildews.  The climate is certainly very favour-
able to the human constitution.  No epidemical distemper,
excepting the small pox and measles, has been known for
many years.  The influenza was not communicated to others,
by those who had caught it in Aberdeen.  The people are, in
general, healthy; and neither rheumatic nor bowel complaints
are frequent, though their houses are often damp and insuf-
ficient, and, in some seasons, fuel scarce and bad.  The scro-
phula may perhaps be reckoned the most common distemper;
and, when pulmonary or hypochondriacal affections occur, these
complaints are generally connected with a scrophulous taint
in the blood.  The assistance of a physician is seldom asked,
till the case is desperate.  In all inward disorders, whisky or
black beer are the common prescriptions.  In cutaneous erup-
tions, (which are much less common, and considered as more
disgraceful than formerly), recourse is too frequently had to
mercurial belts and ointments, which can be got in most coun-
try shops.  The consequences are often fatal.  The country
people are less reluctant than formerly, to go as patients to the
Infirmary of Aberdeen, where they find themselves treated
with much kindness and attention.
