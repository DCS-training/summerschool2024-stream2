proves the ewes about 2 s. 6 d. or 3 s. a-head, which is a
profit of L. 2:10:0, or L. 3, from the acre of turnip, an
acre feeding a score, besides the advantage of the dung and
paddling on a light sandy soil.  The sheep are inclosed in a
web of net stretched on a paling, their horns are sawn off,
in fresh weather, without injury to the animal; in wet wea-
ther they are allowed to go at large.  They thrive faster
when at large; but the turnip are sooner consumed, as they
run to the frest ones, and leave those that are half eaten.
Turnip succeeds best at Linton when sown in the latter end
of May.

   The principal diseases of sheep are, 1st, Iliac passion or sick-
ness.  It attacks the fattest, when first let down to the stubbles,
and ground allotted for their winter provision:  It is cured,
when taken in time, by bleeding and purging.  Turnips, or
clover stubble, are said to cure it; probably by occasioning a
looseness.  2 d, A diarrhoea, which attacks them in spring,
when the new grass springs quickly, after previous starving
in a hard winter. 3 d, Palsy, called trembling, or thorter ill, to
which those fed on certain lands are peculiarly subject.  4th,
The rot, indiscriminately applied to consumption of lungs or
liver:  To this they are most subject in moist soft land.  Rot-
ten ewes have in spring a goiter like the inhabitants of the
Alps under the lower jaw, and are called poked, i. e. pouched
ewes.  5th, The sturdy, or water in the head:  The scull
grows soft above where the water is lodged; and they are
sometimes cured by a trepan, performed by a herd's knife.
6th, Tup lambs are apt to die of eastration, particularly if it
is performed in hot close weather, and especially if it thun-
ders within two or three days.  The operation is delayed as
long as can be risked for the summer heat, to give them a
better crest.
