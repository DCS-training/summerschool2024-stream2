in money, besides the glebe, which is of no great value, most
of it being either rocky or marshy ground.  The Duke of A-

   There are from 20 to 30 for some years past upon the
poor's roll; the only funds for supporting these, are the Sun-
day collections, and the interest of a small sum accumulated
from a few particular donations, and the surplus of the Sun-
day collections.  This sum has increased within these 18 years
from L. 25 to L. 100 sterling.  There are two general distri-
butions in the year, to such as can travel through the parish,
for purchasing shoes, etc. and frequently to those who are
confined by age or distress.
   Besides the parochial school, there are other two charity-
schools in the parish, with small salaries from the Society for
Propagating Christian Knowledge in Scotland.  One of these
is at Lochearn-head, the other about the middle of Strathire;
these are upwards of 6 miles distant from one another; and
each of them about 5 miles from the parochial school.  There
are from 60 to 80 scholars commonly in each of these schools,
during the months of December, January, February, and
March.  Towards the end of Spring, most of the boys go to
the low country, where they are employed in herding till the
ensuing winter; and, besides gaining a small fee, they have
the advantage of acquiring the English language.
