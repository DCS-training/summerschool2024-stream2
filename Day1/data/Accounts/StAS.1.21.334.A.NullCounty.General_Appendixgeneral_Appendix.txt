in some degree, the sophistry, the contradictory reasoning,
the illiberal principles, with which it abounds.
   He supposes (p. 254) the salaries to be moderate, and
such as, with the aid of teaching, may furnish a tolerable
subsistence for a family.  Here he ingeniously 'puts a case,'
and reasons upon it; although (p. 262) he allows the fact to
be, that the emoluments are 'so extremely insignificant, as
'to preclude all hope of procuring a comfortable subsistence

   He proposes (p. 253) to consider, 'whether an augmenta-

   These two suppositions are no doubt very convenient for
the conclusion, which he wishes to draw, namely, that the
present salaries are necessarily belt calculated to excite the in-

to suppose, either that the legislature at present would adopt
the very extreme of augmentation, or that the parliament of
William and Mary appointed salaries then so enormous as to
be sufficient even in there days of expence and extravagance.

would enable schoolmasters to live better without teaching,
than they now do with it; yet (265) he maintains, that an
augmentation, ' instead of making them more wealthy, would
