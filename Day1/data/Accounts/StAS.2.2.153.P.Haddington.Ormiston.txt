place, of all which, females and young children are witnesses and
partakers.
   Fuel.-Coal is the only fuel made use of in the parish.  The
inhabitants in the neighhourhood of Ormiston Hall are supplied
from a pit wrought by the proprietor. Those in the village and
vicinity obtain their chief supply from pits about a mile and a-half
to the north, in the parish of Tranent. The price of a cart of coals
of 12 cwt. is from 4s. to 4s. 6d.
		  MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   Since the last Statistical Account was published, the public road
running through the parish, and also the private roads, have been
very much improved. This circumstance, with a more liberal sup-
ply of manure collected from different quarters, has produced a
proportional improvement in the agriculture. At that time, the
village was in a more thriving state on account of some public
works carried on in the place. All these have been given up for
a number of years, and there is a great want of employment for the
labouring poor, especially in winter, when many are thrown com-
pletely idle, and reduced to great straits. On such occasions,
however, the family of Hopetoun has never been backward to ap-
ply a remedy for an evil which, in the present state of society, can
hardly be prevented.
