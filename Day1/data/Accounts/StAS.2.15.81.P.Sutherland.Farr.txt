fishermen, and herds, the people, in general, are much more ple-
bian, than when the former Account was written. On the other
hand, the improvements by roads, bridges, more commodious inns,
neater cottages, and more regular and sure means'of communica-
tion, form a most interesting and pleasant variety since the date of
that Account. An increase in the number of those who read the
Scriptures in English and Gaelic, and a more extensive circula-
tion of the sacred volume among the families of the parishioners,
are also among the important chaDcres which have since taken place.
The openness of the winters, the absence of those heavy and long-
continued storms of snow, which in former times were so destruc-
tive to every description of stock, and the general mildness and
fruitfulness of the seasons, ought not to be omitted under this
head. Since the harvest of 1816, there has not been an extensive
failure in the ordinary crop of the parish.
   There is much room for improvement on the sea-coast, by a
better system of husbandry among the loiters, by rendering the
landing-places for boats more commodious and secure, and by an
increase of branch roads to some of the townships. It is much
to be regretted that the inhabitants have not more permanent
and regular employment during the winter and spring months; for
by the want of such employment, a great portion of their time
wasted in idleness and dissipation whereas, they would most
willingly avail themselves of any additional opportunities of labour.

August 1834.
