chie, a farmer, who is 105 years old, and, what is singu-
lar in the history of this man, he incurred the censure of
the church, for his connections with the sex, after he had
attained the 90th year of his age.  There are several other
inhabitants of the parish who exceed the age of 90.

   H'ood and Planting.-In the lower parts of this parish,
to the north, there is a good deal of wood, but in the high-
er grounds to the south, where shelter is most needed, it is
very bare, and seems a reflection on many of the proprie-
tors, that they have neglected it so long.  By planting, the
climate, which varies considerably in different parts of the
parish, would be a good deal meliorated, and the high
winds, which are a consequence of its elevated exposure,
and which sweep impetuously from the hills, would not
have such a baneful influence during the harvest in shaking
the crops*.

   Soil and Cultivation.-The soil of this parish is, for the
greater part, a tough clay, soon hardened by the heat of
the sun, unless when well cultivated.  It requires, there-
fore, a good deal of working, and, in this district, the crops
are observed to be richest, after much winter frost, and a
good deal of rainy weather in spring.  Of about 9000 a-
cres which the parish contains, more than 2/3 are arable, or,
at least might be brought into tillage,  The rest consists of
moss or hills.  A good deal of grain is raised here, of all
the different sorts; but, from the heavy rains, which ofter
fall in autumn, the harvest is frequently retarded, and it

*The winds generally blow here in one of two directions, either E.
or W. for the greater part of the year.  The former sets in pretty stea-
dily in the end of spring, and beginning of summer, when the fog, with
which they are accompanied, proves often hurtful to the young fruit.
The west winds are most prevalent in autumn.
