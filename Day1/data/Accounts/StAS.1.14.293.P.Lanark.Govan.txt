     Of Govan:

Sterling, which has hitherto been paid very punctually.
This fund, with fines for irregular marriages, and the
usual deductions from the sessions-clerk's fees, likewise
admits of the distribution of 4 L.  or 5 L.  Sterling at the end
of every half year, to poor householders, who do not re-
ceive regular assistance, and of occasional supply to such
as are found to stand in need of it, between the months 
of June and January; when those who are thought by
the heritors and kirk-session, to be in need of constant
charity, are put upon the poors roll.  The whole fum
annually distributed, is about 60 L. Sterling*.

   Antiquities, &c.-On the lands belonging to Sir John
Maxwell of Pollock, about 2 miles S. E.  of the church,
are the remains of an old castle, of Gothic architecture,
the walls of which, though built in 1585, are yet mostly
entire.  It appears to have been a building of consider-
able strenght, and was, for a long time, the jointure-
house of the Pollock family.  The following inscription
over the door, upon a stone nearly of a triangular form,
is now scarcely legible.

*In so populous a parish, the number of poor to be thus maintained would,
in all probability, be considerably larger, were not pretty literal support given
to their members, when in want, by two societies in the parish, with one or
both of which most of the inhabitants are connected, and whole funds, from
the great exertions to procure new members at the annual election of their dea-
cons, are in a very prosperous state.  It is to be sincerely regretted, however,
that those elections are frequently proceded by a vast deal of dissipation.
