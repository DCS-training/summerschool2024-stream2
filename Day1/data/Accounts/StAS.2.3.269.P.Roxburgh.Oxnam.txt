                           PARISH OF ASHKIRK.

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE.

                   THE REV. G. J. HAMILTON, MINISTER.*

          I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
     Name, Boundaries, &c.--THE origin of the name of this parish
is obviously Anglo-Saxon, and we find it, in the records of the
twelfth century, spelt Aschechyre and Aschechirk; and in more
modern times, we find Askirk, and Ashkirk the present name.
From the large quantity of ash trees with which the parish
abounded, a considerable number of which still surround the church-
yard, there can be no doubt regarding the origin of the name.
Two-thirds of the parish lie in Roxburgh, and the other in Sel-
kirkshire.  It is about 7 miles in length, and about 31/2 in breadth.
It is bounded on the north by Selkirk, west by Yarrow, south by
Roberton and Wilton, east by Minto and Lilliesleaf.
     Topographical Appearances.--This parish presents few features
worthy of detail.  It is entirely of a hilly character, though there
are portions of level land on the banks of the Ale, in openings of
the narrow valley through which that river flows.
     Climate.--The climate must be regarded as rather damp and
cold, from the great prevalence of W. and S. W. winds, and that
a part of the parish is peculiarly exposed to the E. N. E., and
S. E. winds.  But the climate has been much improved by the
extent to which draining and plantations have been carried, and
both might yet be very much extended, with great advantage to
both landlords and tenants.  The health of the inhabitants may be
stated as being fully equal to that of the surrounding district.  There
is a tombstone in the churchyard, bearing to be that a man of the
name of Coltherd, and his wife, who both died at the advanced age of
