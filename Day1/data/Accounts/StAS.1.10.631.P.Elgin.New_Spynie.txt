very productive, and the small possessor finds it his advan-
tage, as one acre will produce 300 stones, when properly cul-
tured, which answers for the food of cattle in summer, and
prevents their sending them to the Highland Glens, 40
miles distance, which was their former practice, and still
partly prevails.  In this parish and the neighbourhood, with-
in 4 miles of each other, there are 9 pidgeon houses well stor-
ed; a sign of the good grain of the parish, which, upon an
average, weighs from 18 to 20 stones, per boll, of barley;
15 stone, per boll, of oats; and 16 stone, per boll, of wheat.
The wheat is meal measure.  That of the other grain ex-
ceeds the Linlithgow boll about a peck.

   Cultivation, Farm Rents, etc.-The farm of Sherriffmiln,
rented by JAMES WALKER, Esq; M. D. claims particular
notice in an account of this kind.  This gentleman, in the
early part of his life, entered, with all the ardour of enthu-
siasm, into the horse-hoeing husbandry, on the plan of
JETHRO TULL; in which he has ever since persevered
with unfailing steadiness, raising crops of wheat, barley, and
beans, in drills without a particle of dung, always following
the intervals, (about 3 feet,) for each succeeding crop; and
thus compleatly demonstrating the effect of cultivation with-
out the use of manure.  Although every operation has been
performed with the nicest accuracy, and in its proper season,
and though the soil of Sherriffmiln seems to be well calcu-
lated for this kind of husbandry, being light and sandy, yet
the result has not been such as to encourage imitation.  The
corn is indeed superior in quality to any in the country;
but the quantity by the acre much less than is raised in the
