the neighbouring farmers.  Hynford bridge, which is placed 
about the same distance westward, opens a ready passage to 
Lanark, and other places in that quarter.  The inundations 
of Clyde, though, in general, they undoubtedly fertilize the 
adjoining haughs, are hurtful at particular seasons.  In the 
spring, the ploughed ground is, sometimes, so much washed 
and smoothed, that the seed cannot be sufficiently covered; in 
some places, where the current is strong , the soil is swept 
away; the seed is frequently displaced, and laid in the sur-
rows.  The summer floods, by covering the pasture-grass 
with sand or mud, make it unfit for the cattle, till it be wash-
ed by the rains.  But the greatest damage is sustained when 
the corns are in the short-blade, immediately after the ear be-
gins to make its appearance.  A high flood, at that time, de-
stroys, in a great measure, the crop.  The farmers are care- 
ful to prevent the loss that might be occasioned from inunda-
tions in harvest, by removing the corns, as they are cut down, 
to higher grounds.  Trout of a large size, and delicate taste, 
abound in this part of the Clyde.  They are often caught 
about 20, and sometimes even 30 inches long.  The red co-
loured are preferred to the white.  The deepest places of the 
river produces, likewise, pike and perch.  The best season for 
catching large trout with the rod, is reckoned to be from the 
middle to the end of June.  

   Soil, Agriculture, Produce, etc.-The lands in the parish
are very different in quality.  A considerable part of them is 
moorish and spongy on the surface; and as this kind of soil 
readily imbibes the rain, so, when it lies upon a clayey till, 
which, in many places, is the cafe here, it retains it long, 
and continues wet through a great part of the year.  The 
grounds which form the sloping sides of the hill, are mostly 
of this fort; and cannot be cultivated by the plough to any
