     Statistical Account

In this parish, neither our civil, nor our ecclesiastical esta-
blishments have been without their effect.  The inhabitants
are peaceable and good subjects; and the spirit of our reli-
gion is, in general, understood and felt to be, what it ever
ought to be, a support to sound morality.  An opposition be-
tween speculation and practical religion, is a common error
among the more unenlightened ranks of every country.  Its in-
fluence is in some degree felt here.  But a more rational spi-
rit seems to be gaining ground.  With regard to forms, and
opinions of secondary importance, the parish has been long
divided; and where this happens, some degree of illiberali-
ty is to be looked for.  In the year 1790, the writer of this
article found 908 belonging to the Established Church; 723
belonging to the.  Episcopal Church of Scotland, and 85 to
the Church of England; 63 were Seceders; 6 were Roman
Catholics; and the remaining 7 were either insane, or be-
longed to no religious community.  But, in general, all
these sects maintain a peaceable and friendly intercourse with
one another.  It might gratify curiosity, and illustrate some
of the leading principles in human nature, to trace the ope-
ration of those causes which have concurred to produce so
great a number of Episcopals in this and in some of the
neighbouring parishes.  But such an equiry would swell this
part of the Statistical Account too much.  It may be ob-
served, in general, that, as the lower ranks are incapable of
forming religious creeds, which can stand the test, even of
their own reflections, for any length of time, we must look
for the causes of a long established attachment to opinions
and forms, in the influence of authority, interest, and habit.
If opposition and persecution unhappily lend their aid to that
influence, impartiality is generally banished, and the effect be-
comes much stronger.
