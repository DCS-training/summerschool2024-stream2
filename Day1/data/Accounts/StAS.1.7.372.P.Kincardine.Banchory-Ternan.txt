   Rivers.-The river Dee is in general pretty rapid; its
banks for most part are adorned with natural woods, and
plantations of various species of trees, forming beautiful and
picturesque scenery in many places.  This is much heighten-
ed at Banchory Tarnan, by the junction with Dee of a small,
but impetuous, and often impassible river called Freuch.  It
is a collection of many streams which come from the Gram-
pian hills; and over this river, near a fine cataract and fall of
its waters among rocks, and also near its conflux with Dee,
almost opposite to Banchory, Mr Russel of Blackhall, has
lately erected a substantial stone-bridge of four arches, and
likewise made good roads leading to it, to the great benefit
of the country, even to a considerable distance.
   The air by the river side is very salubrious, the soil being
dry and sandy; and throughout the parish, it is mostly of a
light quality, though generally on a clay bottom; but a mile
or two north of the river, the wholesomeness of the air must
suffer abatement, from the low marshy fields and mosses, which
are found from the one end to the other.  There is a loch,
called the Loch of Drum, between 2 and 3 miles in circuit,
at the eastern extremity; and another of the same dimensions,
near the middle of the parish, called the Loch of Leys, ha-
ving an artificial island, on oak piles, with ruins of houses,
and of an oven upon it; but there is no tradition concerning
the use which may have been made of the antient structure.
These lochs, and low wet lands, must be unfriendly to the
health of the people.  Accordingly, there are no instances
of great longevity.  At present, there are few above 80 years
of age: Many of the young are subject to sore throats, con-
sumptions, and especially to scrophulous disorders, and of late
there have been four or five instances of chorea sancti viti.-
