try.  No wheat, and but little barley, is raised.  The bear is
not remarkably large in the grain, but is thin in the rind,
weighs well, and recommends itself to the maltster and meal-

8 stone, after 16 pecks of grain.  Until within a few years

most clear and easy soils; and the harness was such as the
ordinary farm servants could make.  Now, Small's plough,
with the short iron head, and cast metal mould-boards, is

attention will be paid, of course, to the rearing and keeping
of horses.  It appears that agriculture, at some distant period,

waste lands, have not yet gone so far as their forefathers

   Rent.-There are two farms above 50 L.; 10 from 20 L. to

   Population.-There is ground to believe, that population, in
the last century, was at least equal to what it now is.  From
the entry of baptisms in the old records, it appears that the
village (Slateford) was then more populous than now.  There
are intimations of other villages, of which there is now little
