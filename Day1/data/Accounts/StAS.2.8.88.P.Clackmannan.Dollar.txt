here parallel with the face Of the Ochills, and appearances lead to
this conclusion, that a much more powerful river than what is seen
at present has made the great excavation; as the coal formation
rocks on the steep banks, south side of the river Devon, are cut
through from the top of the bank to a depth considerably below
the present bed of the river. Upon the rocks to which this excava-
tion is made, the recent alluvial loam, clay, and gravel are laid.
Upon this subject, geologists have as usual theorized; and amongst
the many theories brought forward, one is, that the waters of
Loch Leven were, at one time, discharged through this valley of
the Devon, until, by some natural convulsion, the loch found a new
discharge for its waters to the south-east, forming the present river
Leven. The levels of the surface betwixt the loch and the river
Devon render this theory plausible and probable.
   As to the prices of coal, they vary from time to time; but the
rates are in general verv moderate. At present, the price of coal
at the Sheardale pits is from 4s. to 5s. per ton.
   The colliers can make from 3s. to 4s. a day. They provide their own
tools and light. At present they do not pay any rent for their houses.
