poor mariner, at this season of the year, when the navigation
round the Maoil of Ceanntire is so difficult and dangerous.
   If it be not reckoned too great presumption, I would beg

the inland navigation between Inverness and Fortwilliam.
This tract I have had occasion to travel often; and, though nei-
