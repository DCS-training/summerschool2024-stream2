     Statistical Account, Etc.

labouring people and servants have nearly double the
wages of what they had about 20 years ago.  A day-
labourer gets his victuals and 6 d. a-day, at any season;
in harvest, 10 d. and 1 s.  A man-servant, who can only
drive a cart-horse, is allowed L. 4 yearly; and he who
can plow and sow, gets L. 5 or L. 6.  A woman-servant
gets L. 2 a-year.
