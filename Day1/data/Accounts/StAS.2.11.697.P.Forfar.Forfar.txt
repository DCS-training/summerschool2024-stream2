			IV.--INDUSTRY.
	The great proportion of the population of Forfar is employed
in the linen manufacture trade. The fabrics generally made in
Forfar are, sheetings, Osnaburghs, and dowlas. About 3000 in-
dividuals are employed in weaving. The number of webs wrought
in the week is about 2000. The present depressed wages are,
for sheetings, 8s. per web; Osnaburgbs, 7s.; dowlas, 8s. Out
of this sum the weaver has to pay about 1s. 6d. for winding,

			V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	Town.--The town of Forfar consists of two principal streets,
the one proceeding from east to west, and the other from the cross
to the north. The great road from Perth to Aberdeen passes
through the town, entering at the west and passing out by the
north. There are several smaller streets, and the town was ra-
pidly increasing in population and extent until the depression in
the staple trade of the district, which has continued for some years
has checked the progress of building. Within the last forty years
the aspect of the town has much improved. Before that time the
general appearance of the buildings was mean, many of them being
covered with thatch, and outside stairs and other projections upon
the streets were numerous. But now, the houses are substantially
built, and there are many of a superior description; and the, streets
are open, and all projections into them removed.
	Railway.--The greatest recent improvement connected, with
Forfar and its neighbourhood has been the construction of the
railway betweet Forfar and Arbroath. The terminus at Forfar is
at the north of the town, about five minutes' walk from the cross.
It proceeds through the parishes of Forfar, Rescobie, Guthrie,
and St Vigeans, to Arbroath. The whole length of the line, is
15 miles, 12 furlongs, and 38 yards. * The work was completed
and opened for the conveyance of goods and passengers on the
3d of January 1839.

<FOOTNOTE>Theo Inclination on the line is 196 feet, the terminus at Forfar being thus much
above the terminus at Arbroath.
