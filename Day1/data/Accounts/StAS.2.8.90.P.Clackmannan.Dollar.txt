    The insects most destructive to fruit-trees and fruits in the pa-
rish are :
    Acarus tellurium, red spider ; A. holosericus, scarlet acarus.
--This and the preceding, similar in appearance, are often con-
founded with each other. Both are destructive to the leaves
of all fruit-trees, and particularly the peach. These insects are
too common. The means usually employed for their destruction
are water with a little sulphur in it, thrown forcibly against the
tree, from the pipe of a carden-engine, or other means.
   Eriosoma Mali, American blight.--This is the scourge of the
apple tree, no part of which is exempt from it; it is sometimes
found even in  the pear. It exists in several gardens in the pa-
ris, but not generally. Among the many means employed to get
rid of this destructive insect, the most effectual is to employ a
painter's brush in rubbing in, on the infected parts of the tree, a
strong siie made of glue, or any other similar substance. This to
be continued so long as the pest appears.
   Coccus Arborea, tree coccus.--This insect, although usually
confined to the forests, has found its way into the gardens, and
covers the smooth branches of the apple and pear in, the form of a
brown scale. It is very Common, and may be destroyed by the
same means as the preceding, or by a wash madd of tobacco liquor,
sulphur, nux vomica, and water.
   Anthonomus pomorum, apple weevil.--The larvae of this little
insect are destructive to the flower-buds of the apple. It is not very
common here, although in,some districts it does much injury. No
means have hitherto been found to prevent its, ravages. Where-
ever it abounds, the bullfinch is always to be seen in proportion,
and is its natural destroyer.
   Polydrusus oblongus, a weevil, the larvae of which destroy
