yards manure, at Is. 11d. per cubic yard, L. 5, 15s. The
oil in 1831 was so high in price that blubber was substitut-
ed by Mr Fleming, which cost L. 10 per ton, and double the
quantity was used to the same number of cubic yards of moss.
This did not, however, answer quite so well as the oil, it taking a
longer time to heat and mix with the moss, that is, from two to
three months, before it was ready; but the time it takes to heat
depends very much on the season of the year and the state of the
moss, which ought to be exposed to the air and frost, six or eight
months before it is used, and ought not to be used in too vet a
state. Six acres of barley were manured with this composition
in 1831. The compound of oil and moss not having been long
enough made, it did not become firm enough for turnips, and did
not consequently answer for them; but the barley crop has been
good, and the field looks well, having been sown down with grass
seeds.

Houston; on the south by Kilbarchan and Lochwinnoch; and on
the north by Erskine and the river Clyde.
   Topographical Appearances.--The general appearance of the
parish partakes of the Highland character. The lands in general
rise m gentle swells from the river; and in some places are rocky
an moorish. Here and there, are, clumps of planting, which give
a beauty and variety to the surrounding scenery. This is parti-
cularly the case towards the south. The village is about 350
feet above-the level of the sea, and few spots command a more
