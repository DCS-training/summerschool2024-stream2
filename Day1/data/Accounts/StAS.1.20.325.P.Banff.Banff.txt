     of Banff.

1633, by Vandyck.  Fine heads of Charles I. and his
Queen.  A head of Duff of Consindae.  There are like-
wise a few paintings by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and other
eminent masters.
   The library is a spacious room, near 70 feet in length,
and extending through the whole breadth of the building.
The books are numerous, and well selected.  In a small
apartment adjoining, is a cabinet, containing an extensive
collection of Roman and British coins, medals, etc.
   Lord Fife's park and surrounding plantations measure 14
miles in circumference.
   The park is bounded by the two bridges of Banff and
Alvah, and contains within its circuit a part of two coun-
ties, and four parishes*.  The pleasure grounds are laid
out with much taste and elegance.  The walks are of
great extent and variety, some winding beautifully along
the banks of the Doveran, and others leading off, in diffe-
rent directions, to wide and distant plantations.
   About three miles from the house, where the river is
considerably narrowed by the lofty and impending craigs
of Alvah, a majestic arch is thrown across, which is highly
picturesque.  Here the view which presents itself is pecu-
liarly wild and romantic.  The fine windings of the river,
the rugged scenery on either side, the overhanging woods,
and,

     the precipice abrupt,
     Projecting horror on the blacken'd flood,
                                          THOMSON.

from a landscape truly grand, and worthy the pencil of a
Claude Lorraine.
