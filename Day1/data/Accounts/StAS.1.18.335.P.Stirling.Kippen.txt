   Parish Register,-There are no records extant previous to
the commencement of the present century.  From 1700 to
1745, the register of marriages and baptisms appears to have
been kept with considerable accuracy.  For the 12 following
years, the register of marriages seems to have been entirely
neglected.  From that period too, many parents who had
joined the secession, neglected to get their children's names
enrolled in the parish register.  For this reason, the register,
especially of baptisms, cannot be considered as exhibiting a
complete enumeration of the children born in the parish from
that time downward*.  It may also be observed, that as the
names of parties enrolled with a view to proclamation of
banns, when they happen to reside in different parishes, are
registered in both the parishes to which they severally belong;
this circumstance must make the number of marriages appear
greater than it is in reality.  And therefore in calculating
the whole population of Scotland, so far as regard is had to
the authority of parochial registers, it may be laid down as a
maxim, that the number of marriages will upon the whole
exceed, and that of baptisms fall short of the truth.  In this,
as well as in most country parishes, no account of burials was
kept till within these few years; nor can the register of these
be considered as perfectly accurate.

   Climate, Health, Diseases.-The climate is wet, on account,
probably, of the vicinity of the hills, and the prevalence of
westerly winds.  A register of the weather was kept for many

more complete than formerly.
