     The Statistical Account.

ment arising from assidous, in place of retails teaching, would
constitute too inconsiderable a motive to excite diligence.
In this view, might it not be expedient, that part only of
the augmentation should be given as salary; that the remain-
ing part should not be fixed, but ambulatory, and depen-
dent upon success in teaching, to be judged of by the num-
ber of scholars attending the school?  To this end, might
not a fund be created, under management of the heritors,
out of which the schoolmaster is to receive quarterly a cer-
tain premium upon each scholar attendant upon the school;
the number to be ascertained by attestation of the parish mi-
nister?  Let the premium be fixed at a certain rate per scho-
lar, upon a number not falling short of what may be readily
supposed to attend, upon decent diligence in the teacher;
the rate of premium for each to rise progressively in pro-
portion to the excess of the actual number above that fixed
upon as the test.

   The Poor have no stated pensions; to the end that no cer-
tain dependence may be created, destructive of industry and exertion.
There are no poors rates.  Thee poor are supplied occasion
ally and discretionally, as need is, by the minister, who is trea-
surer; who has no rule but his own knowledge of distress as
it occurs to his own observation, or is communicated to him
by the neighbours of the objects in distress, together with
his own rough computation of what the funds may afford.
The only capital stock is 80 L. secured upon bond of the
trustees for the turnpike roads.  For these sixteen year, by-
past there has been no addition made to the capital; the
annual income being equalled by the expenditure.
