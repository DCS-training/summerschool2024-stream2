   Bursaries.-In 1644, Sir Thomas Crombie, of Kemnay,
made a donation, to the magistrates and town council of
Aberdeen, as trustees and patrons, of certain lands in the
neighbourhood, as an augmentation to the salaries of the
professors, and a provision for eight bursars in the Universi-

family of Ramsay of Balmain.  Besides the a bove, there are
