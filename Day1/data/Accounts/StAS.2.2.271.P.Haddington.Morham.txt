                MISCELLANICOUS OBSERVATIONS.
Morham is one of those few very small parishes in the church
which ought either to be annihilated, by dividing them among the
surrounding parishes, or augmented to a sufficient amount of po-
pulation by additions from such populous parishes as may lie con-
tiguous. In the case of Morham, the latter is the process that
ought to be adopted. Additions might, with propriety, be made
to it, from the outskirts of several of the contiguous parishes, where
the inhabitants are considerably nearer the church of Morham
than that of their own parish. And, in particular, while complaint
is made of the want of church accommodation in the extensive pa-
rish of Haddington, an easy remedy of the evil, in great part,
offers itself, by annexing that portion of the landward district of
Haddington which lies in to Morham to that parish, and, on the
west side transferring another portion of it to Bolton.
