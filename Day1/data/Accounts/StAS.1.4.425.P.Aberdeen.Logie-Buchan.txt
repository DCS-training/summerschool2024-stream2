monly granted in this part of the country, must be menh-
tioned as one great bar to the improvement of it.  There
are a few instances of pretty long leases granted lately;
and as most of the proprietors profess their readiness to
give longer leases when good tenants offer, I hope this
great obstacle to improvements in agriculture will be re-
moved.  There are few sheep; and although of late years
the high prices of black cattle have induced the farmers
to breed more of them than they did formerly, yet grain
may be said to tbe the staple commodity; of which we al-
ways raise a great deal more than is consumed in the pa-
rih.  A considerable quantity is every year sent to the
Aberdeen market, and exported from the Ythan, when
there is any demand from abroad, or from distant parts of
the kingdom.  There are 62 ploughs; that most general-
ly in use is the old Scots plough:  several people are get-
ting ploughs of a more improved construction.  Personal
services by the tenants to the landlords are entirely abo-
lished here.  Subtenants continue to pay some services to
the principal tacksman; but it is generally 6 days only in
the year, for assisting at casting their peats, and building
their sold fences.

   Rents and Size of Farms.-  The valued rent is L. 3751,
13 s. 4 d. Scots; the real rent may be about L. 1500
Sterling.  The general rent of infield ground is 15 s. or
16 s. the acre, although some of it is set at L. 1 and up-
wards; good outfield sets for 6 s. or 7 s. and poor outfield
from 2 s 6 d. to 5 s.  The size of the farms is various:
There are 3 farms which contain upwards of 300 acres;
but two of these are set off by the tenants in smaller
farms, and they do not occupy above one half of them.
The general size of the others farms may be about 120 or
100, and some from 60 yo 80 acres.
