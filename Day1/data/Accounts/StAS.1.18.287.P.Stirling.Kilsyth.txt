planted, and the barley sown in the last week of April, and
first of May.
   The old people make a general remark, that the spring is
much later, and the summers a great deal colder, than they
were 40 or 50 years ago.  Of course, that the harvest is not
only later, but much more precarious.
   One remarkable summer is mentioned about 40 years ago,
in which the heat was so great at seed time, that the labourer
could not endure it at noon.  So that it was a common thing
to sleep the greatest part of the day, and labour in the night.
From barley seed-time, till barley harvest there was not a
shower, but copious dews; yet the crop was the most pro-
ductive of any since that period; though the straw was
short, and the sheaves few, and scarcely a stack to be seen
in a barn-yard, the barns containing almost all the grain and
fodder.

   Price of Provision.-As to the price of provisions, it is ge-
nerally low.  Beef, mutton and veal, are at least a penny
per pound lower than in Glasgow; sometimes even two
pence; lamb and butter always two pence.  Eggs and poul-
try of all kinds are lower in proportion; so that it is needless
to be more particular.  It will doubtless serve the purpose of
a statistical account better, to point out the comparative va-
lue of as many articles as possible, at different periods.  And
as I had occasion to consult an old memorandum book, be-
longing to Mr Cornwall of Banton, who was chamberlain to
Lord Kilsyth in the year 1670, I find the precise price of the
following articles, stated at that period; and in another
manuscript of a private gentleman belonging to this parish,
I find the same articles rated in the year 1745.  I shall there-
fore state the account.
