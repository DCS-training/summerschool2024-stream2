tent of marsh ground exposed to the same accident from the 
sea.  The whole parish is the property of William Hagger-
stone Maxwell Constable, Esq. of Nithsdale, excepting about 600
acres belonging to three different heritors, only one of whom
resides.  The old crost land is set at one guinea per acre; the
other arable land, from 21 s. to about 10 s. the unimproved
pasture and moor ground, of which little now remains, from
1 s. 6 d. to 7 s. the marsh and meadow from 10 s. to 12 s.  Leases
are commonly granted for 19 years, and no more.  The real
rent of the parish is at present L. 2151:8:9. This rent has
been doubled since 1776, and more than tripled since 1756.
Such is the rapid progress of improvement, that nearly 1 s. 5 d.
per acre, more rent is laid on the land, in those leases which are
just now about to be renewed*.  The tenants pay none of the
public burdens, except the road money (L. 14 per annum), the
victual stipend, the tithes of fish due to the minister, and an
acknowledgement of 1 s. 6 d. to the landlord, from every person
who uses the haf-net.  The valued rent is 2597 merks.
