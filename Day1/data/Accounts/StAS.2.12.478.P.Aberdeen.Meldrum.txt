army.  There is still a place of interment at Bethelnie, where the
church of this parish formerly stood.  Several families have their
burial ground in it, and the sepulchral vault belonging to the pro-
prietors of Meldrum is there.  The present church is supposed to
have been erected about the year 1684; it is consequently an old
building, and has an antiquated appearance.  In the immediate
vicinity of Old Meldrum, there is a place of worship belonging to,
the Scottish Episcopalians, and in the town, there is another be-
longing to the members of the United Secession.  The town-
house and town-hall of Old Meldrum are respectable-looking build-
ings, sufficiently adapted to the size of the place.  The House of
Meldrum which is about a mile distant from Old Meldrum, is a
large and elegant mansion, well sheltered and ornamented with wood.

   Previous to the, year 1672, when the town of Old Meldrum be-
gan to extend itself, the population of this parish must have been
very limited.  An increase of 117 took place between the years
1811 and 1821, which arose, in all probability, in consequece of
a number of crofts being set on previously uncultivated land, which
has since been reclaimed and brought under cultivation by the oc-
cupiers.  These little additional posessions are principally on the
estate of Tullo, in the northern district of the parish.  Between
1821 and 1881, the increase was only 18.  The population of
the town of Old Meldrum was, according to the former Statistical
Account, 783; for many years pasrish its population has been about
1000.  In the rural districts of the parish, the number of the in-
habitants is 790.  The average number of marriage yearly is 15;
and of births 45.  There is no register kept of deaths.
