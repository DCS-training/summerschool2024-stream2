pleasant to fee a number of the going down at once; each
of them carry down variously, according to the quality of
the timber, from L. 10, L. 15 to L. 20 worth; and at an
average, the expense of each raft to Speymouth, is about 
L. 1, 10 s. At present, there are 4 saw mills in Aber-
nethy.

   Glenmore Wood.-About 8 years ago, the Duke of Gor-
don sold his sir-woods of Glenmore, in the barony of Kin-
cardine, for L. 10,000 Sterling to an English Company.
There were some inserior companies tried it formerly, but
were not successful.  It appears pretty certain now, that
this Company will succeed in bringing away all the wood 
within their contract, before their lease is out, which was
26 years; and it ought to be the the wish of every well-think-
ing person, that they may have profit in the end, as they
do much good to the country.  They are regular and just, 
and carry on their business in every department of it with
much exertion and propriety.  This was the oldest, the
largest, and the best quality of sir-wood in Scotland, 
and the best accommodated for water-carriage to the 
Spey, by means of the loch before described, that is 
in the heart of it, and out of which a river issues, that 
brings down even their masts loose to Spey, a distance of 5
or 6 miles.  The quantity of spars, deals, logs, masts and
ship-timber, which they send to Garmouth or Speymouth
yearly, is immense, and every stage of a process of ma-
nufactory, brings money to the country; generally once a-
year, they send down Spey a loose float, as they call it, of
about 12,000 pieces of timber, of various kinds; whence
they send it to England, or sell it round the coast.  For
some years, they have sent great numbers of small masts or
yards to England to the King's yards, and other places, and
have built about 20 vessels of various burdens at Garmouth
