     NUMBER XXV.

     PARISH OF STRATHAEN.

     now generally called STRACHAN,

     (COUNTY OF KINCARDINE.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN RAMSAY.

     Situation, Extent, etc.

   THE parish is situated on the north side of the Grampian
mountains, in the bounds of the Synod of Aberdeen, 
and presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil, about 100 miles 
north from Edinburgh, and 21 nearly west of Aberdeen. 
It reaches from the top of the Cairnie-mount to the river 
Dee, which measures 11 miles, and comprehends, accor-
ding to survey, 31,659 Scotch, or 40,230 English acres. 
The arable ground is but small in proportion to the extent, 
perhaps only a fifteenth part of the whole.  Over the 
Cairnie-mount there is a most excellent road, well accom-
modated with bridges, which lays open the communication 
from the southern, to the northern and eastern parts of 
Scotland, and the resort of travellers is very considerable.
