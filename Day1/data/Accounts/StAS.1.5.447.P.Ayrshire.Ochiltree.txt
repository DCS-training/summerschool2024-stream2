     of Ochiltree.

   Rivers.-The Luggar, running to the north west, bounds
the parish for about two miles, and a little farther down
forms a conjuction with the river Ayr.  The water of
Burnock, rising on the southern extremity of the parish,
runs nearly due north, and joins the Luggar, at the village
of Ochiltree, and cuts off a stripe of the parish of about half
a mile broad to the eastward.  The Coyl, running in nearly
the same direction, touches the parish of Ochiltree in some
points on the westward.

   General Apperance.-The face of the parish is pretty
level, undulated by gently rising hillocks, but towards the
south it swells into higher ridges.  There is a thriving
plantation, belonging to the Countess Dowager of Glen-
cairn, which stretches from east to west, almost across the
parish, nearly parallel to the Ayr road.  And the neigh-
bouring plantations of Barskimming, Auchinleck, and Dum-
fries house, afford a fine prosfect to a great part of the pa-
rish of Ochiltree.

   Cultivation, etc-The land is mostly employed in til-
lage, and seeding black cattle, there being only 3 or 4 sheep
farms upon the higher grounds towards the south.  The
farmers chiefly cultivate and depend on an oat crop; they
sow also a little bear, but no wheat or rye.  The land con-
sists of a strong clay soil, spouty in some places, but pro-
ducing good crops.  Black cattle thrive very well, and
considerable quantities of butter and cheese are made for
sale.

   Minerals.-There is only one small coal pit, in the wes-
tern extremity of the parish, which produces a kind of coal
without much smoke, used for drying oats; but there is a-
bundance of coal in the neighbouring parishes of Stair, Cum-
