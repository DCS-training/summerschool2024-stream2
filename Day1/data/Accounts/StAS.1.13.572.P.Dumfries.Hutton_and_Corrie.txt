giving place to the other purposes, This may have been
partly owing to the increasing prices of sheep and cattle,
but may more particularly have been owing to the tenants

getting the better of.  The chief proprietor of these pa-
rishes has lately annihilated the thirlage of his tenants in
every degree.  He has granted leases for 21 years, and

a strip down each hip, and a strip down each shoulder.
