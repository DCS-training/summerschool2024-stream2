of these articles, to those who deal in them, supposing the
consumption to be no greater than it already is, would be
immense.  Vast advantages would likewise be experienced
by Cupar and its vicinity, in the easier rate at which they
would be supplied with timber and states for building, now
brought, at a very great expence, from St. Andrew's, Dun-
dee, etc.; by the farmers on both sides of the river, in the
convenient supply of lime and other manures; and by all
ranks, in the reduction of the price of thai expensive,
but necessary article of daily consumption, coal.-Scotland
has at last opened her eyes, to the vast advantages to be
derived to her commerce and agriculture, from the ease
and small expence of water carriage.  She now follows, with
spirit and steadiness, the bold and successful steps of her sis-
ter kingdom; and when those canals, on a grand scale, which
are now carrying on, shall be finished, it is to be hoped, that
this cut on the Eden, will be one of the first, on a more

   Ecclesiastical State.-The district of Cupar formed a parish
in early times, when the great parochial divisions of Crail,
Kilrenny, Kilconquhar, St. Andrew's, Leuchars, and a few
others, comprehended all the eastern part of the county.
The small parish of St. Michael's, lying on the south of the
Eden, was joined to that of Cupar in the beginning of the
last century.  The church belonging to the parish stood on
that beautiful spot, now known by the name of St. Michael's
Hill.  Human bones are still occasionally discovered in the
field, when the operations of husbandry are going forward.
The ruins of a small chapel, situated near the eastern boun-
dary of the lands of Kilmaron, were to be seen not many
years ago.
   The church of Cupar is collegiate.  The King is patron
