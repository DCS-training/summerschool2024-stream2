     of Callander.

   Erection, etc.-CALLANDER was formerly divided into two
parishes, the one called Leney, and the other a chapel dependent
on Inchmahomo, where the NORIES of that ilk had their family
burying place.  The remains of both are visible, and people
bury at both places.  The northern branch of the river, more
than a century ago, changed its course, and separated the
church of Leney from part of its parochial bounds; and the
same inundation, in the southern branch, swept away the
bridge leading to the chapel; whereupon both parishes were
united, and the parish church was built at Callander, below
the junction of the two branches, where it now stands.

   Extent, Situation, and Surface.-The extent of this parish,
from E. to W., is about 16 computed miles; and its breadth,
at the E. end about 10 miles.  Its form is like a lady's fan
half spread.  It is situated between 56 degree 15' and 21' N.,
and from 1 degree to 1 degree 24' W. of the meridian of Edinburgh,
including the greatest extent of the mountains.  The ap-
pearance of the country on the W. and N., is mountainous.
The hills were formerly black, and covered with heath; but,
by the introduction of sheep, within these 30 years, they are
beginning to lose their shaggy cover, and to assume a more
verdant hue.  About Callander there is a beautiful val-
ley, in which are situated, not only the villages of Callan-
der and Kilmahog, but several fine farms, in a plain of some
extent, which is formed by the confluence of two considerable
branches of the Forth, and covered with rich meadows and
fertile arable land.  The higher ground is here and there clad
with thriving oak woods, and plantations of trees of various
kinds; and the bold stupendous rock, above Callander, di-
versifies the scene, and forms a fine contrast to the valley and
meandering links of the river below.
