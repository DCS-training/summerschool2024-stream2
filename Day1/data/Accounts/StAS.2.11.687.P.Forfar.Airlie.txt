All are taught reading and writing, but some (from the short time
they remain at school) imperfectly.
   Poor's Funds.--The average number of paupers for the last
three years has been 16; in 1842 it amounted to 21. They are
all permanent. The ordinary weekly allowance is 1s, 6d.; high-
est, 5s.; but so much as 7s. has been given when an attendant had
to be provided. The collections at the church door were, in 1840,
L.24, 10s. 7d.; in 1841, L.22, 17s. 4d.; in 1842, L.31, 1s. 7 3/4d.;
the excess of the some collected in the last, above those of the two
former years, being attributed to there having been an additional
sacrament that year, and to part of the Lindertis family residing
in summer. The other sums appropriated to the support of the
poor during the current year are, contributions by the heritors in
proportion to their valued rent to the amount of L.60, and L.2, 5s.
of hearse and mortcloth money. The expenses of management
are about L.6 per annum. Although it has been found necessary
to introduce a system of voluntary assessment, pauperism does not
seem to have made so rapid progress in this as in many other pa-
rished. At the date of the old Statistical Account, there had been
so many as nine regular paupers on the roll at one time, besides a
considerable number receiving occasional supply.
   Fuel.--An extensive peat-moss on the north-east march of the
parish still supplies the neighbourhood with fuel. Elsewhere, the
peat and broom, which were the only kinds of fuel used by the
poorer classes in this dirtrict down to a comparatively recent pe-
riod, have been replaced by seaborne coal, and the refuse of the
woodlands.
