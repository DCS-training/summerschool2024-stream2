                        III.-POPULATION.

The population of the parish of Alvie, as far back as it can be
traced, is as follows, viz.

According to the return to Dr Webster	in 1755,	1021
the last Statistical Account in            1792,        1011
By the Government census in                1811,         961

Do.     do.                                1831,        1092

The cause of increase in the population at the last census was the
return of pensioners, who were serving in the army, during the late
war, and the continuance of young men in the country, on account
,of the difficulty of procuring employment elsewhere since the ter-
mination of the war.

Character, S-c. oftlie People.-The inhabitants of the parish in
general are below the middle size; but they are uncommonly hardy,
and capable of onduriing much fatigue and privation. The lan-
guage spoken by the common people, particularly by the old, is the
Gaelic; but the young of both sexes speak and understand the Eng-
lish language, and are daily becoming more and more indifferent
about their native tongue. The only amusements prevalent in this
parish are camack matches, raffles, and dancing. The old people
are rather slovenly in their dress; but the young have a laudable
taste for cleanliness, and an ambition for finery sometimes beyond
their 'Means. Potatoes and milk may be said to constitute the prin-
cipal food of the peasantry: for all ttie meal which the small tenants
can raise on their farms in their mode of cultivating them, would
