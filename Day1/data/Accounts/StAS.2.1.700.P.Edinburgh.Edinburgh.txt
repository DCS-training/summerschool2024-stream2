the said sum shall not be liable to any arrestment or attachment
that shall be laid thereupon, any law, custom, or usage to the
contrary notwithstanding. The 17th clause of this act provides,
that at any time, upon payment by the Parliament of Great
Britain of the full sum of L.40,000 Sterling, without any de-
duction or abatement whatsoever to be made out of the same, or
any part thereof, and all arrears, (if any such be) of the said an-
nuity or yearly sum of L. 2000 then due, computing the same quar-
terly to the end of the next preceding quarter of a year, and from
thenceforth by the day, until the day of such payment made,-
then, and not till then, and from thenceforth, the said annuity or
yearly fund of L. 2000 shall cease and determine. By the act
12th George I. it is provided, that if the rate of threepence
per bushel, to be levied on malt in Scotland, shall produce a
greater sum than L. 20,000, clear of all charges of management,
the surplusage so produced over and above the said clear sum of
L. 20,000 shall be wholly applied towards the encouraging and
promoting the fisheries and such other manufactures and improve-
ments in Scotland as may most conduce to the general good of
the united kingdom, and to none other use, intent, or purpose
whatsoever, in such manner as shall hereafter be directed by Par-
liament.
   In 1726, the act 13 Geo. I. c. 30, was passed for encouraging
and promoting fisheries and other manufactures and improvements
in Scotland. Upon this act followed the royal patent of his Ma-
jesty King George II., "registrate and sealed at Edinburgh, July
18, 1727," in which, inter alia, by the 18th section, a board of
commissioners are nominated and appointed, any five or more of
them to be a quorum, with full power and authority to exercise
the several powers and authorities thereinafter mentioned. The
funds under the management of this board were, 1. A sum of
L. 14,000 Sterling, arising from the seven years of the annual sum
of L. 2000, which was to have been devoted to the encouragement
of the manufacture of coarse Scottish wool, but of which no part
had ever as yet been appropriated. 2. The said annual sum of
L. 2000, which was to be devoted to the encouragement of the
fisheries and manufactures of Scotland, and which, by act of Par-
liament, became payable from and after the year 1719, not having
been called for until the constitution of the board in 1727 produced
eight years of it, making L. 16,000,-which, added to the above-
mentioned L. 14,000, made L. 30,000 in all; which sum was paid
