   Management of Farms.-The whole of the farmers here,
and especially those whole farms lie in the more elevated
parts of the parish, incline to plough little, but to let their
grounds lie in pasturage for 4, 5, and even 6 years, before
they lay them down a second time in corn Thus, what has
been in crop for the three preceeding years, must be in pasture
for the three or four years following; while those proportions
of the farm that have been in pasture the appointed time, are a-
gain ploughed up, and appropriated for corn, though sufficient
care is not had to crop in due rotation.  To this mode of
oeconomy, the farmers are in some measure obliged to adhere,
because of the dearth and scarcity of proper manure.  Lime is
at hand in the neighbourhood, and some avail themselves of
it; but from experience it has been found, that lime alone,
will not answer a soil and mould so light and quick, with-
out it receives at certain intervals, a more generous and
unctuous manure.  Dunghills consisting of a mixture of
earth and lime, are the kind of manure which is most in
use.
   The greater part of the farmers and people in the neighbour-
hood, send the produce of the dairy to Glasgow, where at
times they find a ready market.  The cheese is of an ex-
cellent quality, being no wife inferior to that mild kind,
which in many parts of Scotland is known by the name of
Dunlop.  A farmer who pays between L. 70 and L. 80 of
annual rent, and who converts the greater part of his milk
into this necessary article, will send 130 stone to the mar-
ket, at 5 s. 6 d. or 6 s. per stone; a very considerable portion
of his rent.
