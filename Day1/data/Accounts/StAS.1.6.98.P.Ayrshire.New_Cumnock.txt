     Extent, Soil, and Climate.
   THE name of the parish, and of most places in it, is de-
rived from the Celtic.  The form is very much of an
oblong square, being 12 miles in length from E. to W. and

church the dale country terminates, and southwards the pa-
rish is generally a pasture country for sheep.  The soil is gene-
rally good and rough, and the hills are covered with green.
The air is generally healthful, witness the long lives of many
who have died above 90, or near it, and some now in the pa-

and runs through the middle, of the parifh.  There are 3 lakes
