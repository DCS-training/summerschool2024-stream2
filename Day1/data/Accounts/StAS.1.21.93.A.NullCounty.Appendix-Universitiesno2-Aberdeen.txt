     University and King's College of Aberdeen.

Bishop of Aberdeen.  It appears that he was employed in
many important affairs of state during the remainder of the
reign of James III. and succeeded the Earl of Argyle as Chan-
cellor of Scotland.  Having retired to his diocese upon occa-
sion of the insurrection of the Humes and Hepburns, which
proved fatal to James III. the insurgents who had the young
king in their hands, and wished Bishop Elphingston at a dis-
tance, sent him ambassador to the emperor Maximilian to
propose a marriage between James IV. then 16 years of age,
and Margaret the emperor's daughter.  Before he arrived the
lady was married to the prince of Spain.  In his return he
concluded a peace with the states of Holland.  His History
of Scotland, at least what is called so, is extant among Sir
Thomas Fairfax's MSS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.
It is divided into eleven books, and consists of 384 pages fo-
lio, in a small hand, full of contractions.  He for the most
part follows Fordun*.
   King James IV. being slain at the battle of Flowden, and
most of the nobility cut off, a Parliament was called to meet
at Stirling, to settle the affairs of the nation, then in the ut-
most confusion.  Bishop Elphinston resolved, notwithstanding
his great age, to attend this Parliarnent, and set out on his
journey, but sickened on the road, and died on the 6th day
after his arrival at Edinburgh, in the 83d year of his age,
anno 1514.
   2. Bishop Alexander Gordon, anno 1516, third son of
James Gordon, laird of Haddo, ancestor of the earls of Aber-
deen.  Died 1518.

*From a late examination of this MS. made at the desire of the University,
who were anxious to obtain a copy, it appeared that it was nothing else than a
literal transcript of Fordun.
