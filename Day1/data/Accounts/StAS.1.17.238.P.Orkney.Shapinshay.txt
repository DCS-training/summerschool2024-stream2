vered a subterraneous building of a singular nature, it had
been formed by digging the earth about 3 feet and
erecting pillars of stones built one upon another to the height
of 4 feet, to support a flat roof of broad stones or flags that
covered the Whole building, which was composed of two
hexagons contiguous to one another, and their diameter about
