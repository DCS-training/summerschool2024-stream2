	Modern Buildings.-- Edmonston, a castellated house of impost-
ing appearance, after a design by Mr Gillespie Graham, is beauti-
fully situate in a secluded valley near the east end of the parish.
Biggar Park, and Cambus-Wallace, are both pleasant residences in
the immediate neighbourhood of Biggar. A large mansion-house
was built on Carwood in 1832, and when the young wood around
it is farther advanced will be an ornament to the country.

					 IV.--INDUSTRY.
	Agriculture.--The parish contains 5852 Scots acres. The town
occupies about 30 of these; 750 are planted, and 400 of hilly
ground are too steep to be cultivated with advantage. There are
about 100 acres of moss, all in the course of improvement, with the
exception of about 35 acres belonging to the town. The remain-
der of the parish is either all arable, or may easily be made so.
	Rent of land.--The average rent of arable land may be stated
at L. 1 per acre. Grass for a milch cow on the best land will cost
L. 4; a one-year-old may be grazed for L. 1, or on rather superior
land for L. 1, 5s; a two-year-old for L. 1, 10s.
