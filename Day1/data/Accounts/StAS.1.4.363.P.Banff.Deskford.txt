and illiberal abuse.  With a view to remedy these evils,
along with the contractor, and oversees should be appointed,
who ought carefully to inspect the materials, and have a
watchful eye over the work in all its stages.  At least, if this
is objected to, it ought to be a clause in the contract, that the
work is not to be judged of, nor the contract discharged,
until the houses have been inhabited for 12 months.

   Stipend, Glebe, School, Poor, etc.-The glebe is about 4
acres arable, including the garden, with about 1 1/4 acres of
grass-ground.  The present stipend is L. 44:15:3 4/12 Ster-
ling of money, with 24 bolls 1 sirlot of barley, and the
same quantity of meal at 8 s. the boll.  The Earl of Find-
later is patron of the church, and sole proprietor of the pa-
rish.-The schoolmaster's salary is L. 2:1:8 Sterling of
money, payable by the heritor, and about 9 bolls 3 sirlots
of meal payable by the tenants.  In summer there are
generally about 30 scholars.-The number of poor pre-
sently on the roll is 32.  This uncommonly great number
may be owing to the abundance of excellent moss, which
has induced them to settle in its vicinity.  The funds be-
longing to them are, the interest at 5 per cent. of L. 1000
Scotch, the weekly collections, which may amount to L. 8
Sterling a-year, and 6 bolls of meal given annually by
the heritor.  These afford only a scanty supply; but ma-
ny of the women are able to earn something by spinning'
flax, and the men by day-labour, so that few if any of
them beg.

   Population.-The return to Dr Webster, about 40 years
ago, was 940.  At present the number of inhabitants is
