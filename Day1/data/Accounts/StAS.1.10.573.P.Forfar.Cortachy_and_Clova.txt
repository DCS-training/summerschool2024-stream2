the southern extremity of the parish of Cortachy.  Around
the Castle of Cortachy, one of the seats of the Earl of Airley,
there are various kinds of forest trees, as ash, elm, larch,
plain, beech, etc.  Adjoining the Castles there is a large gar-
den, abounding with several species of fruit trees, besides a
hot-house for peach, nectarine, and vine trees.  There are
several mosses in the united parishes, most of them situated
near the summit of the hills.  Peats, turf, and heath, are the
principal fuel.  The only stone here, found fit for building,
is whin-stone; but it cannot be dressed with an iron.

   Population, etc.-The number of the inhabitants has de-
creased nearly a sixth part, within these 40 years*.
