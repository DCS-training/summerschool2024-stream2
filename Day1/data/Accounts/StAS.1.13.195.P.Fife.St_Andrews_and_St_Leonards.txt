well known by the masters; so that any tendency to riot
or dissipation is immediately checked; attention, diligence,
and good behaviour, are observed, encouraged and honour-
ed; and the public examination of each class, in the Uni-
versity hall, at the end of the session, excites and maintains
a spirit of application and emulation.  The situation of the
place is very healthy; there are dry walks at all seasons,
the air is pure; the streets are spacious and open; and the
water, which in great plenty is brought into the town,
from adjacent springs, by leaden pipes, is excellent.  Putrid
or malignant diseases are scarcely ever seen in St An-
drew's. Epidemical diseases of any kind are very rare,
and also much milder than in other places of the same size
and population.
   Coal is in great abundance within a few miles of the
city; much also is imported from both sides of the Forth,
chiefly from Dyfart, Alloa, and Borrowstounness.  The
proper weight of a St Andrew's cart-load, or boll of coals,
is 75 stone, or 1202 pounds.  The average price of this
cart-load, including carriage, has hitherto been from the
adjacent mines, 5 s. Dysart, 5 s. 4 d.  Alloa, 5 s. 10 d.
Borrowstounness, 6 s. 4 d*.  The harbour has of late been
much improved, and the mole extended farther towards
the sea.  A spirit of enterprise has arisen among the inha-
bitants, new houses on an improved plan of size, accommo-
dations, and elegance, are yearly rising, and there is every
reason to believe, that St Andrew's will continue to flou-
fish, and will gradually regain its former lustre.

<FOOTNOTE>

*During the winter 1792.3, St Andrew's suffered under the general
complaint, of scarce and dear coals.  The moor coals were raised to 6 s. 6 d.
Dysart and Alloa, to 8 s. 9 d.  Borrowstounness as high as 12 s.
