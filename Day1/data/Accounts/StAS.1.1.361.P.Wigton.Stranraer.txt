   Stranraer, being the chief town of the district, is resorted
to by the inhabitants of the neighbouring parishes for such
necessaries and comforts of life, as their farms cannot furnish,

the price at the shore 13, 14, or 15 pence a bushel; hence
weighty crops of barley, oats, rye-grass, and clover, are raised,
where, not many years ago, weak grey oats could scarcely be
seen.  Some judgment of the state of agriculture in this di-
