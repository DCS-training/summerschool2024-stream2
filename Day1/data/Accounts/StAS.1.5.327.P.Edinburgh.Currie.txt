     of Currie.

   Eminent men.-This parish was celebrated, in former days,
for the residence of many eminent lawyers, and the princi-
pal heritos were, at one time, all of that profession.  Sir 
John Skene, of Curriehill, Lord, Register in the reign of 
James VI. was of a family nearly related to the blood royal.
Sir James Skene his son, was President of the Court of 
Session.  Sir Thomas Craig, of Riccarton, was Lord Advo-
cate in the same reign, and the defender, in a learned trea-

of the feudal system.  Being a man of singular modesty, (a 
trait by which his descendents have been also characterized),
he refused th honour of knighthood, nor would he ever 
give the King an opportunity of conferring it upon him.
He enjoyed it, however, during his life, without any crea-
tion, which was still a higher honour, by the express order of 
the Sovereign.  The Scotts of Maleny, father and son, were 
likewife eminent lawyers at the same period, and the latter 
had a feat upon  the bench.  Thus it appears, that the princi-

mous Sir Archibald Johnston, of Warriston, whose charac-
ter is drawn, in masterly manner, by his nephew Bishop 
Burnet, was s consirable heritor in this parish, and that 
one of his sons, James Johnston, was envoy to Branden-
burgh, and secretary of state, in the reigns of King William 
and Queen Anne. 

   Character.-Till within these few years, the people of
this parish, were sober, industrious, and economical.  The 
vices of the capital, however, are beginning to spread fast 
amongst them, and the introduction of those baneful articles 
to the poor, tea and whisky, will soon produce that corrup-
tion of morals and debility of constitution, which are al-
