19 shoemakers, 70 weavers, 12 smiths, 21 carpenters, 6 
shipmasters, 2 tidesmen, 1 dyer, 1 tobacconist, 2 butchers, 
1 baker, 4 garderners, 6 male domestick servants.  Female 
domestick servants, as well as the farm servants of both 
sexes, are extremely fluctuating, except in gentlemen's fa- 
milies.  The common farmers are not opulent enough 
to afford wages to annual servants, whose termly demands 
are in a state of progression beyond all precedent.  They 
must make their children, to the great prejudice of their 
education, and at too early a period in life, answer instead 
of servants.

   The cattle are remarkable neither for beauty nor size;
and therefore, at present, horses might give from L. 3 to 
to L. 12 or L. 15; cows and oxen, from L. 2 to L. 5 or 
L 6; wethers, and ewes and lambs, from 3 s. to 6 s.  As 
the soil is good, and answers well with sown grasses, a lar-
ger and handsomer breed of cattle might be introduced. 
No attention is paid to raising swine, except at the 5 meal 
mills in the parish, where from 30 to 40 may be sold an-
nually, at from L. 1 to L. 3. 

   Pigeon Houses.-Of these, there are 8 in the parish,
stocked, at an average, with 150 pairs each.  As they live 
on the crop, in spring and harvest, not under 6 months 
yearly, we may fairly calculated their annual consumption 
of grain, from 24 to 30 bolls at least, for every pigeon-
