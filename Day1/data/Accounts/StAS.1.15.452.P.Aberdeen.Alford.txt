ductive.  Such a detail, while it presents the real state of
this country to the reader, will, at the same time, hold forth
a picture of the former state of Scotland; and, by compari-
son with what it presently is, shew that agriculture has arisen,
from the midst of prejudices, supported by popular opinion,
and fanctioned by long habit, to be an art practiced upon

and that the time may come, when the strength, and
wealth, and power of the nation, will, by the resources of

   The in-field or in-town lands, are constantly in white

ed.  The in-field land is generally all stirred immediately af-
ter harvest, and the dunged third part is again ploughed in
spring, and sown with bear about the beginning of May, and
this crop is succeeded by two crops of oats, sown upon the
