parish of Lochs; on the north, by the Atlantic Ocean; on
the east by the Minch; and on the south, by the parishes
of Stornoway and Lochs.

   Surface and Soil.-The surface of the whole parish is
pretty plain, except a few hills, at a considerable distance
from the sea, and some small glens or vallies through which
rivulets run.  The soil, as may naturally be supposed in
such a vast track of ground, is various.  The district called

Scotland; there is, however, less here than upon the main-
land coast, or even in the adjacent parishes, the high hills
which collect the vapours, and break the clouds, being at a
considerable distance.  The frost is seldom very intense;
the snow, in general, not deep, or of long continuance.  The
air, though moist, is falubrious.  Rheumatism, the general
complaint of all most climates, is very common; it is ra-
ther matter of surprise that it is not more frequent, consi-
dering their damp and dirty houses, how much the inha-
