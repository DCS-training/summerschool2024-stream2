prevalent during these months.  The steward has taken 
particular care to introduce the best kinds of oats; the
early, Blainsly, and Cowpar-grange.  But of the most
fertile of those, which is the Blainsly, it requires 5 fir-
lots, Linlithgow measure, to make 8 stone of meal.  The
return of oats, in general, is from 3 to 4 seeds; barley
5, and potatoes 8, when dibbled, but in drill 16.  When
the soil is properly manured, the return in oats and bar-
ley is considerably better; and therefore the tenants
upon Lord Breadalbane's property, are lately restricted
to labour only a certain proportion of their arable; that
is, 2 fields, instead of 3 formerly ploughed; which they
must soon find to be their interest, as it greatly dimi-
nishes their labour, and increaces the return.

   Manure.-The arable is divided into infield and out-
field, or wintertown.  Outfields are manured by teath-
ing, or confining their cattel in fold during summer and
part of harvest.  Infields are manured with byre-dung,
and frequently with a compost of dung, moss, and
earth, collected in the warm months.  There is abun-
dance of lime-stone in the parish, though not much used
as manure.  Tolerable good shell sand may be found
almost in every creek upon the shore; and, of the best
quality, can easily be obtained from Colonia, Mull,
or Arasaig, at the rate of 4 s. or 5 s. a ton.  Fallowing
is a mode of improvement scarcely known in this coun-
try; nor is it adapted to the climate, for the ferquent
falls of rain would rather impoverish than enrich the
soil.

two-thirds of the year, from the S. and W.  It con-
