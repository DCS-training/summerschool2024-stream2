	Unfortunately no register of the height of the barometer has
been kept since 1820. Its average height is given during the se-
veral months of that and the two preceding years:

	It will be seen from the above tables, that the prevailing winds
are the west and south-west; and it may be remarked in general,
that the westerly winds are warm and moist, and the easterly dry
and cold. The heaviest gales are from the south-west, west, and
northwest The climate is mild when compared with that of the
east coast; and, as might be inferred; from the situation of the pa-
rish, the temperature is more equal throughout the year than that
of the inland districts,--the sea-breeze moderating the heat of
summer and the cold of winter. On this account it forms a desi-
rable residence for the invalid, who may suffer from either extreme.
