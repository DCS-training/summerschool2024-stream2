     Statistical Account

a superior style, by the encouragement of the Duke, who
gives them wood, slate, and lime; and most of them will
soon be as well provided.

   Manufacturers.-The only tradesmen are 7 weavers, some
of whom are employed in weaving coarse woollen stuffs,
from yarn which they purchase from Galloway, and that
neighbourhood, and fell at Carlisle for 7 d. the yard; and
the rest either in weaving linen checks, for a manufactory
at the same place, or in country work.  One smith, em-
ployed by the farmers; and 2 tailors.

   Climate.-We have no remarkably old people, only a
Mr. Borthwick, a tenant of the Duke of Buccleugh's,
who is 84; and, except his hearing, retains his faculties
perfectly.  There are no diseases peculiar to the parish,
but what people in all damp climates are liable to.

   Poor, Wages &c.-The poor rates were established in
1774, and have not exceeded, one year with another,
30 l.; and, from the particular situation of the parish, it
is probable will be still less.-The wages of the men ser-
vants, employed in husbandry, from 7 l. to 9 l. a year;
and of the women, from 2 l. 10 s. to 3 l.  The wages of
herds cannot be so easily known, as they are all paid in
kind, so that they depend mostly upon the markets for
sheep and wool.  Day-labourers, 10 d. a day, through
the season, when they get provisions; and 1 s. 2 d. other-
wife.

   Populations.-The inhabitants of this parish have, for some
time past, been diminishing.  I find, in the account given
to Dr. Webster in 1755, the population stated at 392.
