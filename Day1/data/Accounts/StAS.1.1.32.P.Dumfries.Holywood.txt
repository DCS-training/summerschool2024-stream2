beef, wheat, oat-meal, and barley, to Dumfries; a large
quantity of wheat and barley to Whitehaven and Liverpool;
of oats to Greenock; and a great number of young black
cattle and sheep to the towns in the neighbourhood.

   There are bares, and some foxes, and all the fowls which
are natives of the south part of Scotland.  The migratory
birds are the swallow, and the cuckow.  During the whole
year the sea gulls, commonly called, in this parish, sea mixzas,
occasionally come from the Solway Frith to this part of the
country; their arrival-seldom fails of being followed by
a high wind, and heavy rain, from the south-west, within
twenty-four hours; and they return to the Frith again as
soon as the storm begins to abate.

   Roads and Bridges.-The roads were originally made by
the statute labour, but in that way they were neither half
made, nor half kept in repair.  Several years ago, an act of
parliament was obtained for this county, converting the sta-
tute labour into money, to be paid by the occupiers of land,
at a rate not exceeding 12 s. in the 100 merks of Scotch va-
luation, and a certain sum to be paid by the possessors of
houses in towns and villages.  In some districts of the coun-
ty, where making the roads is expensive, the occupiers
of land have been assesed to the ultimum; but in this, and
some others, the assessment has never been more than 6 s. 
for each 100 merks.  The conversion money is very well
laid out in this parish.  The roads are put, and kept; in as
good repair as the sum collected can possibly do; but, as the
roads are extensive, and, as there is a thoroughfair through
the parish, from a large and populous surrounding country,
to the markets Dumfries, this sum is too small to keep
the roads in sufficient repair; and it would probably be cheap
