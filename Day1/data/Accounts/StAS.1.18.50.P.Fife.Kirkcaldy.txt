at present eating the bitter fruits; no one cause perhaps hav-

that spirit of "insubordination," which has of late occasioned
such general alarm.  Not only does the irreligion of the
higher ranks abate their personal respectability and influence;
but, as the common people, by a process of mind of which
the meanest are capable, transfer the character of their su-

it has the effect of inducing an unfavourable opinion of the
holders of place and power in general.  And, what is still
more injurious to the interests of society, it operates in the
way of example, gradually to weaken and destroy the res-
traints of religion on the public mind, and so to leave it
open, and without a guard to the impressions of the ill-dis-

would derive to themselves, in respect of improvement and
comfort, they would secure at once, a personal influence,
and an accession of strength to the state, which, so long as
they set up independant of religion, all their exertions will
be insufficient to gain.
   Through the irregular attendance of many of the upper
ranks, the public supplies for the poor are here drawn
chiefly from that class of inhabitants on which they ought
to fall lightest, those whole personal labour is generally
no more than sufficient for the comfortable maintenance of
their own families.  It is not surprising, therefore, that
notwithstanding the populousness of the parish, the ordinary
collections for 12 years preceding 1791, produced no more
