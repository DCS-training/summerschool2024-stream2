   600 square miles, is nevertheless too inconsiderable to have been
   heard of in Egypt by Ptolemy, in the beginning of the second century,
   any more than its two conjoining brooks, the Lochty and the
   Lenoch, winding through their own dun hills.  It is certain, that the
   Lossie in bygone ages occupied at different times different channels in
   its progress to the sea. Embankments of earth to prevent the overflow
   of a spet were formed partially along the lower grounds adjacent,
   to the river several years ago; and since the deeply disastrous
   flood in 1829 they have been improved into a style of magnificence
   and security on both sides of the river through the whole extent
   of the plain,-reared on a base of 20 feet broad, to the height of
   8 or 10 feet, where the ground is low, slanting upwards to a trim
   walk along the top, of 3 or 4 feet in breadth.  In one very obstructive
   bend of the river, a straight course of half a mile was then
   also opened, to the depth of more than 5 feet, in wideness more
   than 40 feet.  After the first swell, which cleared out the new channel,
   its bottom was found a bed of clay, in which ridges formed
   by the plough in the direction of the shadow at one o'clock, accurately
   parallel and equal in breadth, were to admiration presented,
   which being now scarcely four feet above the level of the frith
   during the flood, suggests several interesting geological considerations,
   relating both to the surface of this part of the globe, and
   the scientific state of agriculture, before that deeply interesting alteration,
   which superinduced upon this corn field of clay, a bed of
   fertile sandy loam, over an extent of nearly 1000 acres to the thick-
   ness of nearly 6 feet; when it was thus cultivated, the frith could
   not have been so far within the land, and even the German Ocean
   must have been then at a lower level than it is now. Secure, however,
   as these costly embankments way be deemed at present, yet,
   if given up with presumptuous security to the burrowing of the
   aquatic rat and of rabbits, they will soon be found insufficient. In
   the excavation of the canal for the drain of the, Loch of Spynie,
   there were six varieties of shells dug up, of which oysters and cockles
   bore the, larger proportion with some specimens of a petrifaction
   called Belemnite, of which there is as little known of as the
   Cornu ammonis. In the beach which shut in the eastern end of
   the lake from the sea, such large accumulations of oyster shells
   have been found as to have been carted off for manure. In a new
   couse lately formed for the brook which works the mill of Lhanbryd,
   at the distance of seven miles southward from the shore, and
   more than two northward from the hill in which its component
   streamlets are united, there was turned out a boulder of more than
