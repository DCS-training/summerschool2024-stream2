pensive land carriage, makes this necessary article extremely
dear, particularly in those rainy seasons in which peats cannot
be saved.
   As there has been no actual survey of this parish, the number
of acres can only be computed by the length and bredth.  The
length, 12 miles, multiplied by 8, the breadth, is equal to 96
square miles, or 61440 Scotch acres.-The surface is much
diversified with heights and hollows, intersected by numerous
streams descending from the hills.  Heath is the prevailing ap-
pearance, excepting  where the land has been in tillage.  Near 
the shore of the lake, there is good natural pasture, much va-

the building, to have been occupied by 2 powerful chieftain,

Inish-Eraith, mentioned by Dr. Smith of Campbotown, in

chapel.  Near this, is Elam'n tagart, or "Priest's isle," with
some traces the priest's house still discernible.  Lochow abounds
with trout and salmon.-Lochavich, antiently called Loch-
