     NUMBER XXXIV.

     UNITED PARISHES OF WISTOUN AND
     ROBERTOUN.

     (COUNTY AND PRESBYTERY OF LANARK, SYNOD OF
     GLASGOW AND AIR.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JOSEPH HENDERSON.

     Name and Extent.
   THE parishes of Wistoun and Robertoun were united in
1772.  Robertoun was probably so called from some
eminent person of the name of Robert, or from some opulent
family having conferred it as a portion upon a son of that name.
-Wistoun, in old papers Woolstoun, derives its appellation
from wool; for about the middle of the village, which gives
name to the parish, near the church, there is a green mount,
called the Cross, where in former times wool was sold.  Situ-
ated betwixt the low and the high lands, or betwixt the arable
ground and the sheep farms, it must have been a convenient
place for a wool market; and so might naturally have obtained
the name of Wools-town.
   The united parishes extend about 5 miles along the west banks
of the Clyde, whose course here is nearly from S. to N. It
is almost equally extensive in the opposite direction.
