ated to the worship of a saint.  But as there was always a
small portion of ground around such a place of worship,
which was considered as consecrated, and used for burying
those who died in the peace of the church, the word kil
or cille came in process of time to signify a burial-place,
which is now the common meaning of the word in the Gae-
lic language*.
   From the various windings of the road passing through
Kiltarlity, this parish, in the line of the road, is upwards
of 40 miles long; but in a straight line, it is at least 30 mea-
sured miles from N. E. to the N. W.  At an average,
it is supposed to be at least 6 miles broad:  thus containing
180 square miles, or 91,638 Scotch acres.  Of this extent,
there may probably be a 30th part arable, or 3054 1/2 acres,
all under corn and potatoes, excepting a few acres under tur-
nip and sown grass.  The same number of acres, or rather
more, may be under meadow-grass.  The remainder is un-
der wood and heath.  The church and manse are situated
within three measured miles of the east end of the parish.
Eastward of the church, the north side of the parish is pret-
ty level; but the south side is high ground, mostly covered
with wood and heath, excepting a small piece of culti-
vated ground, called Clunes, signifying, in Gaelic, the
gradual declivity of a hill, and possessed at present by
about 12 small tenants.  Clunes is near the very height
of the ground, with a south exposure.  To the west
of the manse, the parish is intersected by 4 small burns,
which run from the S. S. W. and W. so that this
part of the parish is divided into 4 different ridges;

<FOOTNOTE>

*I suppose Cille to be derived from the Latin, Cella, after the introduc-
tion of Christianity into this country, and that the Latin term Cella is de-
rived from the Gaelic word Culie, signifying a corner, or place of retire-
ment.
