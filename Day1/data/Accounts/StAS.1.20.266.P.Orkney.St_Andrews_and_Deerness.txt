   Servants Wages.-To the same causes, and that many of
the inhabitants are employed in making kelp during the
summer months, may be ascribed the great scarcity of ser-
vants, both in these parishes and all over the country.  A
man-servant has from two to four guineas yearly; and a
woman-servahnt from 12 s. to 20 s.; and herds in proportion.
All servants are maintained in the family.  A day-labour-

finished next year.  The church of Deerness, is, by land,
eight and a half miles distant from the manse, with a bad road.
The manse was built about 25 years ago, but so superficial-
ly executed, as to be scarce habitable when the present in-
