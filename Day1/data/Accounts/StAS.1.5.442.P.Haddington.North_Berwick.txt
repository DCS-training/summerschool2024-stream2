either on thin clay, or on light land with a gravelly bot-
tom.  The common method of sowing them is after the
plough, in every secon surrow, which sets them in drills,
separated from each other at the distance of about 18 inches.
The intermediate spaces are cleaned, either with a small
plough drawn by one horse, or by hand hoeing, or both
ways, which, indeed, is the best method.  Beans, when pro-
perly managed, yield very large returns, particularly in
moist and wet seasons.  The quantity sown is from 6 to 7
sirlots or Winchester bushels, per Scotch acre.  The species
is the Scotch or Fife bean.  When this culture was first
introduced, the small English horse bean was frequently
tried, but is now entirely laid aside, being found by ex-
perience to run too much to straw, and to be late in
ripening for this climate.

   Proprietors, Rent, etc.-There are 7 heritors in this parish.
The three principal proprietors, who possess together above
9 tenths of the whole property, ususally reside in it.  One
farm consists of more than 400 acres, and a few of less than
100, but by far the greatest number are from 100 to 200
Scotch acres in extent.  The number of farms has neither
increased nor diminished for many years.  The rent
of land is here from 15 s. to L 2. 16 s. per acre.  It has been

new lease is still continues to rise.

ter having been accidently lost or destroyed, it obtained a
new one from James VI.  No manufactures are at present
