   School.-The school-master has a legal salary of 200 merks
Scotch, which, with about three quarters of an acre of land,
and other emoluments, will amount to about 30 L. Sterling
yearly.

   Pitkeathly Wells.-The mineral waters of Pitkeathly, which
have long been famed for their efficacy in curing or alleviating
the scrophula, scurvey, gravel, etc. are situated in this parish.
This mineral is gentle in its operation, has an agreeable effect
in relieving the stomach of crudities, procuring an appetite,
and exhilarating the spirits; and, instead of weakening, tends
to strengthen the constitution.  The water is of a cooling qua-
lity, and very efficacious in removing all heat and soulness of
the blood.  It is used both for drinking and bathing.  In
some cases the warm bath has the most salutary effect, espe-
cially in scrophulous and scorbutic complaints, but should be
used with caution, as it tends to weaken, if made too warm,
or used too frequently.  The time, when this mineral was dis-
covered, cannot be ascertained with certainty:  even tradition
says nothing of its first discovery.  There are five distinct
springs, all of the same quality, but of different degrees of
strength.  In the year 1771, some experiments were made on
one of the mineral springs, by Doctor DONALD MONRO of
London, which, in 1772, together with a letter from the late
Doctor Wood of Perth, on the same subject, were published
in the LXII. volume of the Philosophical Transactions.  This
year, (1792) Messrs.  Stoddart and Mitchel, druggists in Perth,
have, with much attention and accuracy, analized the seve-
ral springs.  The following table, is the result of their re-
peated experiments.
