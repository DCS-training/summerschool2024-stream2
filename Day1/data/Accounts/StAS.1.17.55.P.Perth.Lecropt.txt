   Fisheries.-The cruives of Craigforth are placed on a ledge
of rocks, which extend across the Forth, having one end in
this parish, and the other in the parish of St. Ninian's.  The
tide flows up to this ledge; which circumstance renders it a
proper station for a fishing of this kind.  A great number of
salmon is taken, when the cruives are kept in proper repair.
Salmon are also taken on the Teath and on the Allan, besides
trouts, pikes, and perches.

   Village, Manufactures, Mills, etc.-There is only one vil-
lage, called the Bridge Allan, which consists of 28 families.
None of the tenements are feued.  They are all the property
of Mr Stirling of Kier.  The villagers are variously employed,
ministering to the convenience of the country.  There is, par-
ticularly, a brewery for malt liquor, where strong ale, small
beer, and porter, are made.-This village is situated on the
Allan, a river more remarkable, at this place, for its roman-
tic scenery, of a deep glen covered with a variety of wood,
and its tumultuous current, than for the quantity of its water.
The Allan, within a short space, drives several mills, for meal,
barley, and flour.  There are, particularly, 3 mills for making
a coarse paper, known by the name of Callender paper, which
clothiers use in pressing cloth.  The village has also the ad-
vantage of being situated in a plentiful country, near coals,
and at the separation of the two great military roads, the one
going by Callander, to the west of Scotland, and the other,
by Crieff, to the north: So that no situation seems to be bet-
ter adapted for erecting a village on a large scale.

   Sources of Profit.-The farmers in the clay land, who have
lime in abundance near at hand, and for a moderate price,
make their returns m0fily by their grain.  In the upland,
the farmers have not only the same command of lime, but
