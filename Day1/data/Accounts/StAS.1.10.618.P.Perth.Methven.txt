     Statistical Account

These little circumstances are mentioned to shew, how much
the manner of living is improved here in so short a time.
About 4 fifths of the meat, exposed to sale in the village, are sold
in the neighbourhood, and what remains on hand is carried to
Perth :  And it may be added, that, in quality and variety,
it is, for the most part, equal to what is to be had in the
Perth market.  The trade of killing cattle for the Perth
market was long carried on, to a considerable extent, by the
inhabitants of this village and neighbourhood; and the Meth-
ven butchers were, about 50 to 60 years ago, much richer,
and in better credit, than those of Perth.

   Roads.-As a great part of the parish consists of strong
clay, our roads in winter have been wretchedly bad, the sta-
tute labour not being adequate to uphold them in decent re-
pair.  But lately, an act of Parliament has been obtained
for a turnpike road between Perth and Crieff, the line of
which passes through a great part of this parish; and is con-
ducted through an uneven country, with a skill which does
much honour to the abilities of Mr Abercrombie, the engi-
neer, who directed it.  It will be finished in the course of
this season, (autumn 1793,) and will contribute much to the
improvement and accomodation of this country.  The 
cross roads are also assuming a much better appearance, now
that the statute labour is applied entirely to them.

   Antiquities.-The first mention found of METHVEN, in his-
tory, is about the year 970, when COLENUS, reputed the 79th
King of Scotland, is said to have been killed in its neighbour-
hood, by ROHARD, Thane of Methven, whose daughter he had
deslowered.  Before 1323, the lands of Methven belonged to
the MOWBRAY'S*, whose ancestor, ROGER MOWBRAY,
