     Statistical Account

   Roads and Bridges.-  The roads have been made by sta-
tute-labour, and are still kept in repair by the same means-
I will not say that the statute-labour is not sufficient for
this purpose, but in the remiss manner in which it is ex-
acted and executed, it is by no means sufficient for keep-
ing them in proper repair; and it is pretty certain, that
much more work might be carried on by commuting it,
even at the low rate at which the law fixes it, of 1 s. 6 d.
each man for the season.  I believe an act of Parliament,
obliging the country people to pay money in place of
working, would be a most essential service to the country.
It is doing the gentlemen, in this corner, no more than
justice to say, that they have of late been very attentive,
and at considerable expence in building bridges; and
there is great reason to think, that in a few years, bridges
will be erected in every place where there is any necess-
sity for them.

   Population.-  According to Dr Webster's report, 40 or
50 years ago, the numbers were 575.  At present, (1791),
there are exeactly 538 souls, of whom 284 are males, and
254 females.  Upon the average of 10 years, there have
been 10 births, and 5 marriages yearly.  As there is no re-
gister of burials kept, I cannot ascertain the number; but,
from the best accounts, I suppose there are about 7 yearly
at an average.  The population of this parish is much the
same now, as it has been for these many years past.  In
deed, after the year 1782, the number of inhabitants de-
created about 40 or 50, owing to some farms, becoming va-
cant, after that calamitous period; but these are now occu-
pied by new tenants.  A Seceding meeting-house was built
within this parish last summer, but there are only 2 families
of professed Seceders in it.  There are also 2 families of
Episcopalians.
