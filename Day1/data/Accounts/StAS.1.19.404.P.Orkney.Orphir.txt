trary.  And for the hardiness and bravery of the seamen of
the present day, about 2000 of whom have step forward to
serve their country, in almost every war since the Hanove-
rian succession, his Royal Highness Prince William, the son
of our gracious Sovereign, can vouch.

   Fossils.-There are here a few slates, of an inferior qua-
lity, and some excellent flags.  Abundance of iron ore is
found lying on the surface of the ground, but no attempt
has been made to dig up any.  Blue stone, fit for building,
and also freestone, are to be had in great abundance.  There
is a curious vein of the latter sort in Houton-head, adjacent
to the sea, of about 20 feet in height, and 100, or upwards
in breadth, and consisting of a variety of colours, some
white, some yellow, some green, and some of a jet black,
and sometimes of all of these colours beautifully blended
together.  A small fragment of this rock was lately pre-
sented to an eminent seal-cutter in Edinburgh, who pro-
nounced it to be very valuable, and admirably adapted for
finishing side boards, or the ornamental parts of chimneys,
provided it could be found hard enough to admit of a po-
lish.  For the sample presented to him, as well as all the
outward surface of this vein, is so soft and brittle, as to yield
to the slightest impression:  But, if quarrymen were em-
ployed to penetrate the rock to a sufficient depth, it might
be discovered to be adapted for many of the purposes to
which the finest marble is applied.
   Some coal-stone, such as is met with near the surface of
coal-mines, has been discovered, among the rocks of Wauk-
mill Bay, the property of Mr Honyman of Graemsay; but
no trial has been made of it.  Some very fine white and
blue clay is dug up, beneath the flood-mark in Sraugro
Bay, commonly used for colouring chimneys and hearth-
stones.
