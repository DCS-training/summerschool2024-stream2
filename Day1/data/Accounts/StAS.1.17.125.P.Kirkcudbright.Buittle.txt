the following season, in spite of the rigours of winter; and
though constant experience declares, that the oats, sown in
the beginning of February, afford the most profitable return,
still the sowing of that grain is delayed till the middle of
March; nor is the seed barley committed to the ground sooner
than the middle or the latter end of April.  The harvest,
as might be expected, corresponds with the seed time.  Sel-

   Leases.-In farming, as in most other concerns, a man's
exertions depend very much on the prudence of those prin-
ciples, in which his endeavours originate.  In Galloway, and
perhaps elsewhere, one maxim seems for ages to have fetter-

maxim seem to have been adopted in England.  The one is,
by leasing the ground from year to year, and stipulating, an-
nually, what improvement is to be made, and whether at
the coast of the landlord or tenant.  The mode of farming is
