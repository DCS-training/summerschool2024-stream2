   Poor.-The number of poor on the roll for the last seven
years has been 20.  They are all maintained in their own
houses, or boarded in other families.  The annual sum ex-
pended upon them, may amount to L. 65 Sterling, which
is levied at two different times in the year from the pro-
prietors and tenants equally.  This assessment is laid on
by the proprietors; but the tenants have a vote in the di-
stribution of it.  The collections at church on Sundays are
small, and do little more than pay the salaries of the pre-
centor and beadle.  There is only one beggar in the pa-
rish; but strolling poor from other places come among us
at all seasons.

   Roads.-The roads are pretty well taken care of by the
Justices of the district.  Formerly 1 s. 6 d. for each man,
and 2 s. for each horse, were levied annually for statute-
labour.  By a late act of Parliament, it is now laid on ac-
cording to the valued rents, and paid by the possessors.
The management is vested in Justices of Peace and Com-
missioners of Supply, and other trustees.  The utmost they
can exact is 10 s. Sterling on the L. 100 Scots of valued
rent, but they can make it as low as they please when the
state of the roads allow.

   Birds and Beasts.-There are plenty of partridges, some
plovers, woodcocks, snipes, curlews, and other birds, both
stationary and migratory, which are common in this part
of Scotland.  Little injury is done by birds of prey; but
much was formerly sustained from foxes, to which the furze
and brush-wood on the lower skirts of Eildon, both in this and
Melrose parish, afford cover.  Of late, however, their num-
ber has been diminished by the Noblemen and Gentlemen
