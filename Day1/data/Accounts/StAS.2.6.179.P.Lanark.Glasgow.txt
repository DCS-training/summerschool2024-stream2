	The Lord Advocate having directed the parochial clergy of
Scotland to furnish him with a detailed account of the schools in
their respective parishes, a valuable statistical document may be ex-
pected in the course of the session of Parliament 1836. This, in
connection with the periodical Reports of the Committee of the Ge-
neral Assembly for increasing the means of Education and Religious
Instruction in Scotland, will exhibit the amount of education in a
very satisfactory manner. The Committee's Reportror l835 gives a
detailed account of five of the Glasgow parishes, viz. the College,
Tron, St David's, St John's, and St James's. The Report is ac-
companied by a table showing the amount of population, number
of parochial, endowed, Sabbath, and week day evening schools,
number of scholars, salaries of teachers, number of persons un-
able to read and write, &c.
	Andersonian University.--This seminary, founded by Mr John
Anderson, Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of
Glasgow, on the 7th of May 1795, and endowed by him with a
valuable philosophical apparatus, museum, and library, was incor-
porated by a seal of cause from the magistrates and council of this
city, on the 9th of June 1796. The university is subject to the
inspection of the Lord Provost, and other official persons, as ordi-
nary visitors, and is placed under the immediate superintendence
of eighty-one trustees, who are elected by ballot, and remain in
office for life, tinless disqualified by non-attendance. The trustees
consist of nine classes of citizens, viz. tradesmen, agriculturists,
artists, manufacturers, physicians and surgeons, lawyers, divines,
philosophers, and, lastly, kinsmen or namesakes. The trustees
elect annually by ballot nine of their number as managers, to whom
the principal affairs of the university are intrusted during the year.
The managers elect by ballot from their number the president, *
secretary, and treasurer. Although the views of the venerable
and celebrated founder embraced a complete circle of liberal edu-
cation, adapted to the improved state of society, it was found con-
venient at first to limit the plan to natural philosophy, chemistry,
mathematics, and geography.
