are greatly injured; the great scarcity of timber; the want of
water-falls to drive machinery; and, aboveall, the fatal duty upon
coals; to which, may be added, the want of persons of capi-
tal and spirit to provide employment for the poor, who suffer
much from neglect, no provision being made for their support,

parts of the kingdom.

   Character of the People.-The people in this parish are natu-
rally sober, active, and industrious.  They are greatly more ci-
vilized than they were 20 or 30 years ago, particularly since all
intercourse of a contraband nature with the Isle of Man has been
broken off.  They are in general, contented with their situation,
and behaviour, that, not only during the incumbency of the
present minister, but from time immemorial, not one indivi-
dual among them has been convicted of a capital crime.
