                       IV.-INDUSTRY.

<TABLE=INDUSTRY>

         Agriculture.-
		    Arable land, about 2770 acres.
		    Wood,               550
                      Uncultivated,      4300

         Rent.-The valued rent of the parish is L.2082, 6s. 8d. Scots;
the real rental is about L.2830 Sterling. If no separate value is
supposed to be put on the rough pasture, the arable ground rents
about L.1 per imperial acre.
         Husbandry.-The soil is a dry and friable loam; the climate
is early; the average produce of the imperial acre is about four
quarters; the grain is heavy; oats weighing from 40 to 44 lbs.;
bear, from 50 to 54 lbs.; and barley, from 54 to 58 lbs. per
btshel. The general character of the husbandry is excellent.
	The pure Aberdeenshire breed of cattle, which in many parts
of the country is corrupted and ruined, has been kept up in this
parish; an intelligent tenantry perceiving that it is much better
suited to the soil and climate than those crosses which require
rich and sheltered pastures to bring them to maturity. Within
the last twenty-five years, great and permanent improvements
have been effected ; substantial and commodious farm-steadings
have been built; farms have been subdivided by fences; marshes
have been drained; and the range of cultivation has been gradu-
ally extended over our waste moorlands, and up our mountain
sides. Under the old leases, the seven course system of cropping
was followed, consisting of three grasses, three grain crops, and
one green crop. Under the new leases, on Mr Farquharson's
property, the tenants are generally bound to adopt the six course
system of cropping, consisting of three grasses, two grain crops,
and one green crop. The draining of the Loch of Auchlossan,
which consists of about 250 acres, would be an improvement of a
valuable character; the cold damp vapours, whicb in August and
September often blast the crops, would be no longer exhaled from
