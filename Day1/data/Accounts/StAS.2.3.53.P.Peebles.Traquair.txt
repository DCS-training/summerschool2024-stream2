it is believed that we shall not be above fifteen or sixteen miles
from coal; and that what now costs here from 10d. to 14d. per
ewt., will, on an average, be reduced fully below the lowest of these
two prices.
  Compression of Peat.-The time and attention required for
the drying of peat has been the great objection to its more gene-
ral use; and it is on this account chiefly that we consider the
plan of  compression lately introduced to the notice of the pub-
lic as deserving of atttention.  The writer of this having made
several experiments on the subject, feels confident in stating,
that a very considerable quantity both of time and labour in the
drying of peat may be saved by this process; but it appears to
him, that, unless some simple, effectual, and speedy plan of with-
drawing the peat from the box after being cnmpressed be employed,
the value of the plan of compression will be, as to economy, almost
completely neutralized.  On this point he would simply throw out
the followling hints 1st, The principle of the corking-machine, by
which I perfectly perpendicular movement is communicated through
the lever to the piston, or lid of the box in which the peat is to be
compressed, is indispensable. 2d, The box itself ought to be firmly
fixed to the platform on which it rests; and, 3d, a false bottom
(perforated, of course, like the real bottom of the box,) with an up-
right rod of iron attached to each end of it, so formed as to tra-
verse (also perpendicularly) in a groove in each end of the lid or
piston, with a knob at the top of each rod, by which, wben the
lever is raised up, after compression, the peat might be withdrawn
from the box, and then with else and expedition removed off
this false bottom by the hands of the person who builds up the
compressed peat in the, small stacks or " rickles."  By this plan
we think that two men, one to cut the peat, and the, other to work
the lever, with two, or it the most three women or boys to take the
peat, from the cutter, to place it carefully on the false bottom, to
remove it when compressed, and to build it up in the heaps for
drying, would be quite sufficient for the whole process; and in this
way we should suppose that the expense of the compressed peat
would not be more than double of cutting in the common
way ; or when ready for carrying home, not more than that of
common peat, because all the expense of " fitting " and " turn-
fitting; in a word, all the labour between cutting and carrying
home is saved, and the whole work os done in one or more conti-
nous days.
