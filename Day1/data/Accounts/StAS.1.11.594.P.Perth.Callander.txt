   Villages.-The proprietors of the villages of CALLANDER
and KILMAHOG, are extremely desirous to find employ ent
for their respective people Kilmahog has not increased so
much of late as Callander has done In the former, the houses
are not the property of the possessors; but new houses, of
better construction are frequently built, and a few acres of
ground are given to each family; upon which, with their own
industry, they are enabled to live with comfort and with ease.

<FOOTNOTE>

of indolence eradicate every desire of exertion; the whole frame is corrupted;
despondency ensues; and misery, mingled with contempt, produces the direful
effects of despair.  Many instances might be mentioned; but every person of
observation can quote abundance for himself.  It is a wise maxim, therefore, to
increase the population of villages, providing the people are rendered industrious;
otherwise, it is the greatest curse that can befal a place.  Thriving villages
afford a ready market for whatever the farmer has to sell; and, in return, pro-
vide him with artificers and labourers, and many other conveniences, which he
stands in need of; besides, that it is to these nurseries of the human species,
properly constituted we are to look forward now, for men to recruit our army
and navy in the hour of danger, while our hardy peasantry are decreasing
daily.

+We have no data to ascertain, with accuracy, what the population was
15 years ago.  None have emigrated in whole families; but some young men
have gone to the West Indies and America as surgeons, clerks and teachers;
several artificers have been tempted to go to Glasgow; and servants have gone
to the south and east country, by the prospect of high wages.
