                    MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

Since the former Statistical Account of the parish of Clack-
mannan was written, there have been a great extension and im-
provement of the embankments along the side of the Forth ;
thorough-draining, liming, and manuring, have been practised on
a continually extending scale; the character and value of all the
different kinds of farm-stock has been now much enhanced; a
great additional length of rail-roads has been formed, and their
general character, in common with that of other roads, has been
very much improved. The climate, too, has been ameliorated,
and the aspect of the country been made more attractive by ad-                Pleasi g o observe, that a propor-
ditional degree of improvement has taken place in regard to the
food, and the raiment, and the dwelling-houses, and all the other
constituents of comfort of the people.
