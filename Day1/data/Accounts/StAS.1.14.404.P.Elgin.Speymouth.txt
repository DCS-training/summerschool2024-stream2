river is in a flood, the fare is raised.  There is another
ferry at the mouth of Spey.  Another road leads from
Garmouth, or the mouth of Spey, along or near the side
of the river to Rothes and the Highlands.  A third road
leads from the same place to Elgin.  All these roads are
in pretty good condition.  Like the other roads in Mur-
ray, they are, from the lightness of the soil, and the
dryness of the climate, easily kept in tolerable repair.
Turnpikes would not suit the state of this country, nor
would they, it is believed, be at all relished.  The ex-
pense would be too great for the general condition of
the people.  It would be better to convert the statute-
labour into money, at a low rate.  There is reason to
think, that 1 s. 6 d. for every man for the year, would,
if properly applied, go farther in keeping the roads in
repair, than the statute-labour itself, as at present ex-
acted.
   This parish has the honour of a connexion with the
celebrated family of Chatham, which, though somewhat
distant, is not to be omitted*.  Jane Innes, wife to
Governor Pitt, and great grandmother to the present
Chancellor of the Exchequer, was daughter to James
Innes, Esq. of Redhall, a place within a few hundred
yards of the present church of Speymouth, on the bank
of Spey, immediately opposite to Gordon Castle.  The
family of Redhall was a branch of the family of the
Inneses, Baronets, of Coxtoun.-From the situation of
this parish on the river Spey, it has been the scene of
some actions of same in our history+.
