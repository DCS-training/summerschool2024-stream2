the heights of Mannerhead and Dollar-Law to the north end of
Scrape, and crossing Tweed below Stobo, runs northward in the
direction of Lyne, Newlands, and Linton. Dollar-Law, just men-
tioned, seems to have derived its name from being the site of a
battle, and was popularly called Dolefu' Law or Doleur-Law.
   The antiquities which remain to be noticed are, the Standing
Stone, a rude obelisk, "with uncouth sculpture deck'd," which,
having been removed from the situation which it originally occu-
pied, was built into the wall by the side of the parish road, and is
supposed to be an aboriginal monument; the "Font Stone "
which stood in St Gordian's chapel "while yet the church was
Rome's," but was afterwards removed to mark the spot where
three lairds' lands met; the "Giant's Grave," a tumulus which
has Dever been opened; and, lastly, "some appearance of a build-
ing," says Armstrong, "on the summit of Woodhill, called Mac-
beth's Castle," but which, that states, in despair of making any
thing of the vague popular tradition respecting the famed Scot-
tish tyrant, believes to have been consecrated for the worship of
Woden by the Druids, whose memory cannot be held in sufficient
reverence, for the relief which they afford to many a puzzled an-
tiquary.

   Character of the People.-From the nature of their employments
shepherds have occasionally a good deal of leisure, which that class
of individuals in this parish (and they form a very remarkable part
of its population) devote to the improvement of their minds by read-
ing, instead of indulging in idleness or immorality: and of them,
and of the people in general, it may be justly said, that their cha-
