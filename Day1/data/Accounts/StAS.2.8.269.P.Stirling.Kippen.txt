number of acres which never have been cultivated, and which re-
main constantly waste, or in pasture, is about 4256, about 2000
of which belong to the extensive moor in the higher part of the
parish, and to the patches of moss which still remain to be cleared
away from the lower grounds: they are of very little value. There
are upwards of 300 acres in these patches of moss, which might be
profitably brougbt under cultivation. The expense of clearing away
the moss from each acre, is about L.28; and the rent of the
acre when cleared and cultivated, is nearly L. 2. There are 200
acres of undivided common connected with the above moor. The
number of acres under natural wood is about 62; and under plan-
tations 500.
    Rent of Land.--Some of the carse land is let at about L. 2,
10s. per acre; and some of the dryfield is let at more.  But the
average rent of the arable land, including the carse and the dry-
field, or towards the summit of the rising grounds, may be about
L. 1, 5s.; and the average rent of the remaining portion of the ara-
ble land may be about 7s. per acre.
    Rate of Wages.--The rate of wages to farm-servants is from
L. 12 to L. 14 per annum, with victuals; and to female ser-
vants, L. 6. The wages of day-labourers are 1s. 6d. with victuals,
per day, for men; for women 1s. The wages of wrigbts and ma-
sons are 2s. 6d. per day, with victuals.
   Husbandry.--The farm-buildings are generally good, and the
lands, especially in the lower parts of the dryfield, and in the carse,
are well enclosed. The crops are chiefly wheat, oats, barley, and
beans; but wheat and beans do not, in general, produce an abundant
crop in the dryfield. Wedge-draining is now very common in the
carse, and contributes greatly to its fertility. The expense is often
defrayed, in favourable seasons, by the abundance of the first crop.
Draining is in very general use in the dryfield, many parts of which
are greatly improved by means of it.
    The Ayrshire breed of cows prevail in this parish, and great
attention is paid to improving them.
   Produce.--The average gross amount and value of raw produce
raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows:
