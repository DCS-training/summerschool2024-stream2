     rish of Kinnoul; as well as the sulphate of barytes, the carbonate
     of strontites, calc-spar, &c.
       Alluvial Deposits.--The alluvial deposits which cover the stra-
     tified rocks in the less elevated parts of the parish consist of gra-
     vel formed of rounded portions of granite, quartz, gneiss, and other
     primitive rocks, intermixed with sand and clay, both of which are
     frequently in a stratified state.
       Boulders.--Irregular blocks of granite and gneiss, measuring from
     3 to 4 feet in every direction, are occasionally to be found on the
     borders of fields in the less perfectly cultivated spots of the parish;
     but in consequence of the improved state of agriculture which now
     prevails in this district, these obstructions to the plough have, long
     ceased to be observed in the lower grounds.  These boulders, be-
     longing to rocks of the primitive class, must have been rolled from
     a very great distance to reach their present locality.
       The alluvial materials, composing the subsoil of the lower part
     of the parish, are  largely impregnated with the muriate of lime;
     and accordingly, the water obtained from wells and pits, sunk in
     the town and neighbourhood, are, in all cases, found to hold in so-
     lution a considerable quantity of the same salt, together with more
     limited portions of the muriate of soda and magnesia.
       Rivers and Streams.--The parish is interjected by no running
     stream deserving of notice, with the exception of the lade for con-
     veying water to the town-mill to be afterwards described, but it is
     bounded on the north by the Almond, and on the east by the Tay,
     which is not only the largest river in Scotland, but if the magnitude of
     streams be estimated by the quantity of water they convey to the sea,
     the largest in britain.  The surface from which the various tributaries
     of this noble river derive their supplies, possesses an area of 2750
     square miles, whereas the basin of the Spey contains onl 1298 3/4
     square miles, and that of the Forth 54 1/2 square miles.  It must be
     admitted, indeed, that the volume of water, discharged by a river
     into the ocean, is not always proportional to the extent of the sur-
     face which it drains; since the varying latitude of the district
     through which it flows, and still more the inequalities of its sur-
     face, especially when that surface assumes a mountainous character,
     modify, in a considerable degree, the quantity of rain that flows into
     the basin of a river.  But in the case of the Tay, as contrasted
     with the Spey and the Forth, the criterion mentioned may be safe-
     ly applied; the geographic position and condition of surface being
