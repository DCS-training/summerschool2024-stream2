to the parish, amounting in all, communibus annis, to 12 L.
Sterling.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The number of heritors is 8.
Sir James Hall of Dunglass, Bart. is the only residing heritor.
The whole valued rent is 3675 L. 1 s. 10 d.  Scotch; real rent,
about 2000 L. Sterling.  The house of Dunglass stands on
the west side of the small river, which divides East Lothian
from the county of Berwick.  The banks of the river are
steep, and covered with remarkably fine wood, through which
a variety of agreeable walks are cut, and kept in good repair.
The Castle of Dunglass is frequently mentioned in the Scot-
tish histories.  It belonged, for many years, to the Earl of
Home's ancestors, and from this he has the title of Lord Dun-
glass.  It was here that James VI. lodged with his retinue,
the first night after he left Edinburgh, on his journey to Lon-
don, 1603.  This fort was, by accident or treachery, blown
up, anno 1640, when Lord Haddington, and a number of the
neighbouring gentlemen, perished in its ruins.  The present
house, a modern building, is raised on the very spot where
that fort stood.  Near it stands an old chapel, which, though
not now used for the purpose it was originally intended, is
still kept in good repair.  It was built about the middle of the
fourteenth century by Sir Thomas Hume, who married Ni-
colas Pipdie, heiress of Dunglass.
