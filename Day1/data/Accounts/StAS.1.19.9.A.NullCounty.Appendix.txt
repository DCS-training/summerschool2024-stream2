land, called St John's Croft, where the Chapel of Ease to
the parish of Old Machar now stands.  The Magistrates
and Council appear to have purchased the patronage of
St John's, on account of its vicinity to the town, and situa-
tion within the royalty.  There were likewise monasteries
of several different orders of Friars established in Aberdeen,
beside the Trinity or Red Friars already mentioned, viz.
the Black Friars in the Schoolhill, where Gordon's Hospi-
tal and the Grammar-school now stand; the Carmelite or
White Friars, along the south side of the Green; and the
Grey Friars, in the Broadgate, where the Marischal Col-
lege and Church are now situated.
   The number of Advocates, or Lawyers, in Aberdeen,
under the incorporation charter, will be seen from the
Aberdeen Almanack; although five or six do not practise
before the Courts, and some others are removed from
town.

   Erection of the New Pier, and the great Advantages
arising from it.-The New Pier lately erected on the north
side of the entry of the harbour of Aberdeen, and at the
month of the river Dee, extending to 1200 feet in length
along the side of that river, and a considerable way into the
sea, was begun to be built in June 1775, and was finished
in October 1780, according to a plan furnished by John
Smeaton, Esq; engineer; the expence whereof, and of the
additions which have been made to it, by his advice and
directions, since it was built, particularly a jettie or catch
pier, for sheltering the shipping within the harbour from
the violent inrun of the sea in easterly storms, has amounted
to about L. 18,000 Sterling.  This expence has been de-
frayed, partly by some small funds formerly belonging to
the harbour, but chiefly will be paid by the doubling of
the shore and harbour dues upon the trade and shipping of
