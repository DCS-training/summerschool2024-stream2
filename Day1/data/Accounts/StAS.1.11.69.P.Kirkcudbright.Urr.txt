   Antiquities.-In this parish there are few of any importance.
Several moats and fortified camps are to be met with, both in
Urr, and in the adjoining part of Buittle.  These moats ap-
pear, however, to be Danish or British works, rather than
Roman.  Tradition itself hath long been silent as to their
origin.  Earthen urns, filled with calcined bones, are fre-
quently found in this neighbourhood.  But the burning dead
bodies was a custom common to the Romans with the north-
ern nations.  The Moat of Urr is perhaps the larger work
of the kind in Scotland.  It stands on the west bank of the
river, about half a mile below Urr church.  A survey and
drawing of this moat would have been here given, had this
consisted with the plan of the work for which this article is
written.  Though the ditches, and the construction of Urr Moat
in general, are by no means Roman, yet, about 30 years ago,
some outworks remained, seemingly erected by that people.
These outworks adjoining to Urr Moat, and having some re-

by the accidental firing of the heath, in the year 1781, and a considerable num-
ber sold to the neighbourhood.  For these 10 years to come, it is computed these
Scotch firs may produce the above annual revenue; not to mention the deci??
wood, which is not yet fit for cutting.
