     Statistical Account

   Trees.-Two oak trees adjoining to the public road at Blar-
quhosh, in the western extremity of the parish, attract the
notice of passengers, as being unusually large in this part of
the country.  The trunk of the largest, measures 15 feet in
circumference, and its branches form the radii of a circle 30
yards in diameter.  As the public road passes underneath it,
it falls within the notice of every traveller.  The other grows
near it, and though not quite so large, is a more beautiful
tree, having a taller trunk, and being more closely covered
with foliage.

   Inundations.-Owing to the vicinity of the hills which at-
tract the clouds, the Blane is frequently subject to sudden
swellings.  It has however, only risen twice to an alarming
heights withing the memory of persons now living.  About
60 years ago, a water spout is said to have burst at its source;
which poured such a torrent from the hill, as threatened
unavoidable destruction to the plains below.  Happily how-
ever, as the Blane falls into the valley, at a place whence it
declines to both the east and west, the waters, bursting from
their accustomed channel, were discharged eastward.  By
this circumstance, the country was saved at that time, from
the effects of the deluge.  The waters turning in this direc-
tion, where the valley is wide and level, they stagnated upon
it.  Here also, they could do little damages the ground to-
ward the east for 2 miles being marshy.
   The accounts, however, which old people gave of the mag-
nitude of that inundation, were such as appeared fabulous;
till they were again formidably exemplified, during a thunder
storm on the 13th of August last, 1795.  About 8 o'clock on
the evening of that day, the clouds which during the after-
noon had hung in threatening aspect around the skirts of the
horizon, were condensed above the Earl's seat.  Here they
