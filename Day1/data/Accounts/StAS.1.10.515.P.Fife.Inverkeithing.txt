     of Inverkeithing.

   The following additional particulars were received since
the preceding account went to the press.

   In the grounds of Castland Hill, the property of the Earl
of MORTON, a lead mine was accidentally discovered about
30 years ago.  The ore is laid to have been of an extraor-
dinary fine quality.  The stratum was found to be very irre-
gular, and of unequal thickness.  After being wrought for
some time, it totally disappeared.  A considerable sum was
expended, and the working of it attended with some loss.
It is, however, thought, that there is plenty of lead ore in
these lands, and that it might be wrought out to great ad-
vantage.

   In the beginning of last winter, a considerable shoal of
herrings came into this bay; and, about the North Ferry,
they were caught in great quantities, and the fishing conti-
nued for a long time.  In the beginning of this winters there
came a still greater shoal, extending all the way from Inch-
Comb to Inch-Garvie.  A great number of boats, from the
east coasts of Fife, well manned, and supplied with proper
nets, are now employed in this herring fishing, and meet
with ample success.  The herrings are pretty large, and very
good.  They are sold at different prices, and sometimes so
very low as 6 d. per hundred.  They are carried to Edin-
burgh, and many other places, in a fresh state.  Some mer-
chants have sent up several vessels to take them in, properly
salted in barrels; and, it is said, propose to send them to the
London and foreign markets.  They still continue* in the
greatest plenty, and may probably do so during a great part
of the winter season.  Some young,whales, one of which has
been caught, disturb the fishing, and sometimes destroy the
nets.
