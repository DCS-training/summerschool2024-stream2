   The following statement will give some idea of the state of edu-
cation, &c. of the persons generally committed to the Bridewell:
   During the year from 1st January to 31st December 1838, the
number of individuals committed was 252 ; of which were recom-
mitments, 32; making the number committed for the first time,
220.  Of these 220, there were 42 who could not read, 76 could
read with difficulty, and 102 could read easily ; 124 could not
write, 82 could write a little, and 14 could write easily ; 83 attend-
ed no place of worship, 103 attended church occasionally, and 34
Had been in the habit of attending regularly.  67 were natives of
the town of Aberdeen ; 40 of the county of Aberdeen; 40 of the
counties north of Aberdeen; 48 of the counties south of Aberdeen;
14 of England; 9 of Ireland; and 2 were foreigners.
   Of the whole 252 commitments, there were attributed to intoxi-
cation, 131 ; idleness and bad company, 78; want, 10; uncertain,
denied their guilt, &c. 33.
   Prison.-The old prison, which was situated in the tower under
the steeple in Castle Street, was in every respect unsuited to its
object, being neither properly ventilated, sufficiently capacious,
nor secure.  In 1829, the foundation of a new prison was laid im-
mediately behind the Court-house, and it was first occupied in
July 1831.  It contains sixty cells and ten day-rooms, one of
which is appropriated for debtors; the other nine have lately been
converted into work-rooms.  There are six yards within the pre-
cincts of the prison, four of which are used by the male prisoners,
and one by the females, the remaining one being connected with
the debtors' room.
   The criminal prisoners are not permitted to hold any intercourse
with each other, and they are kept apart as much as possible.  They
are all employed, tried as well as untried, in such works as pick-
ing oakum, weaving, tailor-work &c., and for the females knitting
and sewing, and an account is kept of the produce of their labour,
and their earnings are given to them on leaving the prison,  They
are allowed access to the yard one at a time, for about two hours
each, daily.
