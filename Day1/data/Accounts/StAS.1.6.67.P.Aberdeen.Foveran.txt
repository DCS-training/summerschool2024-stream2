a glebe of 5 acres, is L. 95 sterling.-The king is patron.-
The schoolmaster's salary is 100 merks, and L. 3:6:8 ster-
ling.  The funds for the support of the poor arise from the 
interest of a capital of L. 210 sterling; a mortification of 
L. 1:6:8 per annum; and the collections at the church-doors;
which last, at an average, may amount to L. 20 per annum,
exclusive of the annual collection fot the infirmary at Aberdeen. 
The number of poor who receive alms (not including such as 
are occasionally relieved), is about 40; and each of these re-
ceive from 2 s. to 5 s. every quarter, for the distribution is made 
quarterly. 
   In 1782, the wants of the parishioners were, in a great mea-
sure, supplied by the importation of 4 cargoes of grain from 
England, which fold at about 28 s. per boll.  As this price 
was too high for the poor to pay, the heritors contributed 
L. 20, the tenants L. 20, at third L. 20 was taken from the 
poor's funds, and L. 20 more was borrowed, making in all 
L. 80; with which the session bought out and pease meal: the 
former they sold at prime cost, 1 s. 3 d. per peck; and with e-
very peck of oat meal so sold, they gave 2 pecks of pease meal 
gratis; by which means the poor had their meal altogether at 
5 d. the peck, and their wants were seasonably and effectually 
supplied.  One of the tenants not only advanced the last L. 20
without charging interest, but sold a considerable quantity of 
meal to the poor at 1 s. per peck, when it had risen to 1 s. 6 d. 
in the market, as an evidence of his gratitude to Providence 
for blessing him, amidst the general scarcity, with a plentiful 
crop.
