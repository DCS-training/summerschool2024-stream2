or gravel is generally,turnip, barley, or oats; grass from one
to three years; oats.
   A considerable number of horses are bred in the parish,
both for private use and sale.  The black-cattle are of a 
large kind, and many are raised as well for the market as 
for private use.  The number of sheep now bred in the pa-
rish is considerable.  Some of them are of the large English
kind, but in general they are of a middling size; they produce 
a great quantity of wool, and of a good quality.  It is a cus-
tom to buy in a number of ewes about the month of Octo-
ber, from Northumberland, and some from the western parts
of the county and Teviotdale, in the spring, about March.
These, leaving the wool and lamb in summer, are sed and 
sold off towards the autumn.  Upon the whole, the produce 
is many times greater than what is necessary for the con-
sumption of the inhabitants.  The largest of the black-
cattle sed in the parish, and the heaviest of the sheep, are
sent into England; the smaller and lighter kinds are sold in
the markets at home.  Most of the corn is disposed of in the 
neighbouring markets, and what remains for sale is sent to 
Berwick and Eyemouth.

   State of Property.-The heritors of the parish, possessing
properties above 20 acres, are Mortonball, Harcarse, March-
mont, and Caldra; none of whom are resident except the 
last.  The quantity of land occupied by these heritors can-
not be exactly ascertained, as a great part of it has never
been measured; but, from the best calculation that can at 
present be formed, it appears to be 4127 acres; of which,
about 57 acres are under planting.-Number of tenants oc-
cupying above 20 aces is 15, of whom three are non-resi-
dent; but their farms are superintended by grieves or over-
seers.
