     Population.
   It is not known that there are extant any records which
contain the state of the population of this city at any distant
period.  The population, however, owing chiefly to the
rapid progress of manufactures, has greatly increased within
these 40 years.  In 1755, according to Dr Webster's ac-
count, it was 10,488.  It appears, according to list taken
up by order of the ministers in 1789, that the number of
souls in what is called St Nicholas parish, amounted to
16,386.  According to a list of the inhabitants within the
strict limits of the city, as divided into four quarters, taken
in the month of July 1795, by a committee appointed by
an act passed in the last session of Parliament, for making up
the first rent-roll, and superintending the first election of
commissioners of police, the population was as follows:

   From the register of baptisms, which, owing to the ne-
glect of Dissenters, and other causes, is extremely defective,
no accurate list of births can be obtained; but, according to
an extract from the baptismal register, such as it is, the an-
nual average from 1st October 1771 to 1st October 1790
amounted to no more than 149.  As no register of burials
is kept here, the number of deaths is not known.  The
annual average of marriages, as taken from a pretty exact
register, is about 112.
