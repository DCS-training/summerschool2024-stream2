     BURNSIDE, one of the Ministers of that Town.

     INTRODUCTION.

   CITIES, towns and villages, generally owe their origin
to some natural or accidental advantage of situation.
The bottom of a bay, the mouth of a river, a fertile plain,
the protection of a fortress, or the sanctity of a place of re-
ligious worship, invite men, even in the rudest times, to as-
semble and settle together.  Where any numbers of man-
kind meet, it unavoidably happens, that they must often
mutually compare, combine, and oppose their abilities and
exertions.  Human industry and genius, become, in these
circumstances, more vigorous and active; and what was, at
first, disfigured by the scattered huts of a few rude and help-
less savages, comes, by degrees, to be improved into a splen-
did or commodious city.
