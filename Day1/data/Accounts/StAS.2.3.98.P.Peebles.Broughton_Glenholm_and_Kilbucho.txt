commodious house, with a court of offices in good repair. It forms
a convenient stage betwix Edinburgh and Moffat; and in the
parish of Kilbucho a new inn was lately built. Rachan Mill is al-
so a public-house, conveniently situated for the accmmodation of
the public, as it stands at the junction of the road from Peebles
to Moffat with the great from Edinburgh to Dumfries. There
is also an alehouse in the village on a smaller scale.
  Fuel.--The distance from fuel is one of the greatest drawbacks
on the comforts of the public. The coal is mostly brought from
Ponfeith, which is eighteen miles distant from the centre of the
parish. Kilbucho moss supplies a number of the farmers there
with peat. The thinnings of the plantations in the other two di-
visions of the parish afford a supply of fuel to a few of he neigh-
bouring poor. The wood is not sold, but given to them gratis.
12 cwt. of coals may be purchased at the mouth of the pit for
half-a-crown. The tolls are 1s. more, and when the carriage is
paid for, the cart will cost 12s. 6d. When the peat-moss is at a
considerable distance from the residence of the consumer, that
species of fuel comes ne`rly as high as coal.
