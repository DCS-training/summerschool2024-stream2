conclude, that it is natural for them to be lazy and indolent.
But nothing can be more unfair than to judge of them in
this way, by a comparison with people accustomed all

kets for vending and purchasing the produce of their in-

to be idle, but the want of encouragement and regular em-
ployment, that checks the industry of the Highlanders.  It is

   Proposed Improvements - Were the labour and industry of
such a number of able men, as are in the Highlands and Islands
of Scotland, properly directed and encouraged, the effects,

The most valuable discoveries might be made; inexhaustible
magazines and materials for every branch of manufacture
might be found out; and the exertions and inventions of a
great part of the kingdom, which are now lying dormant,
might, happily for themselves and society, be thus brought
into action.  The most effectual means of bringing about
such a change seems to be, the lessening and regulating the
present duties on salt and coals; the erection of towns or

been made in erecting villages, will certainly be attended
with good effects; and if the number were increased, there
good effects would be multiplied.  By a canal through the
isthmus at Crianan, the navigation between the Western Isles
and Clyde would be rendered safe, easy, and expeditious, at
all seasons of the year.  By another canal between Inverness
and Fort William, a direct communication would be opened
from the welt to the east coast of Scotland, which would be
