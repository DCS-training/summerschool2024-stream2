     Statistical Account

   There are eighteen parish-ministers in Orkney, (the parish
kirks thirty two,) divided into three presbyteries, in each of
which there are six ministers.  Of those who filled these
offices twenty five years ago, when the author of this article
was settled, only three incumbents now remain, one in each
of the presbyteries; viz. one in the parishes of Hoy and
Guymsay, one in the parishs of Ronsay and Eglishay; all
the other parishes in Orkney, have been vacated by the death
of their respective pastors, some of them by the death of
more than one incumbent.

to hold their offices.  The inscription is in a Monkish rhyme,
as follows:

     Omnia terrena per vices sunt aliens;
     Nune mea, tunc hujus; post mortom nescio cujus.
