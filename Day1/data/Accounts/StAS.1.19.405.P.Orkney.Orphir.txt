     of Orphir.

   Quadrupeds, Birds, etc.-All the different sorts of qua-
drupeds and birds, which are to be met with in the other
parishes of this country, are also to be found here, the bird
called the lyre excepted, which is peculiar to the high rocks
of Walls and Hoy, and the Redhead of Eday.  It is re-
marked of the island of Cava, and of some other small
islands, that neither rat nor mouse will live in them.
