the remains of one of whith we are now describing. A second
was built at Inver, and the third at Store.
  5. On the Stronchrubie farm, and near the high road, there
may be seen an extraordinary mass of stone and lime, having the
appearance of having been in former times a part of some very
large and thick building, such as an old castle.  The lime seems
as if infused into the mass.  As there is not the least vestige of
any such building iD the neighbourhood, it is difficult to account
for it, unless we suppose it to have assumed its present form in
consequence of some volcanic eruption.
  There are no modern buildings of any note in the parish, though
there are several tolerably good dwelling-houses.

                       1801                    2419
                       1821                    2803
So that, upon the whole, the population has been on the increase.
Of the present population about 1400 are attached to the church

	Language.-The Gaelic language is still universal in Assynt,
and the only medium of religious instruction.  The English language,
how-ever, is making slow but sure progress.  The youth of
the parish are ambitious of acquiring it, being, sensible that the
want of it proves a great bar to their advancement in life.  It is
likely, nevertheless, that Assynt is one of the very last districts
in which the Gaelic language shall cease to be the language of
the people. It is remarkable that the Gaelic School Society will
probably prove the means, at a remote period, of the expulsions of
the Gaelic language from the Highlands.  The teachers employed
by that, useful society, to whom we owe much, taught the
young to read the Scriptures in their native tongue.  This implanted
a desire to acquire knowledge on other subjected, which
induced them to have recourse to the English language as the
medium of communication.
