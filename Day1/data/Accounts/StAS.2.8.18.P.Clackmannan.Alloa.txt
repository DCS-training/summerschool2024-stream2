  Tullibody woods are also extensive, and comprise a track of
woodland of fine sylvan beauty. The more elevated parts are, in
general, covered with Scotch fir (Pinus sylvestris) and other
pines or soft wood, as they are called chiefly as a shelter to forest
trees, in the younger plantations; but occasionally standing by
themselves, and being of stately size, they add to the height of
the rising grounds, and to the picturesque appearance of the land-
scape. In the more fertile lower grounds, the usual forest trees,
oak, ash, beech, horse-chestnut, planes, poplars, &c. are in a very
thriving condition; and these, with all the other trees, appear to
have been planted. The most generally prevailidg tree appears
to be the oak, (Quercus Robur,) several of which are of great size.
  Only that portion of Shaw Park wood which surrounds the
mansion-house is in this parish,--and it consists chiefly of beech.
There are a few other thriving trees, oak, elm, lime, chesnut, &c.
and some varieties of the pine, including fine healthy specimens of
the cedar of Lebanon, but not remarkable for size. It is surpris-
ing that this tree is so little cultivated throughout the country. It
grows as fast to a large tree as the oak, stands as long or longer,
is green all the year round, and, therefore, a shelter to the land,
at the same time that it is the most ornamental of all large-
growing trees. +
  In Alloa woods, a few of the trees have, been measured, (the

  The Deodar, or Indian cedar, (Cedrus Deodara,) introduced to Britain in 1822,
seems, in respect of its timber, possessed of all the properties ever ascribed to the ce-
dar of Lebanon, compared with which the tree seems also equally, if not more har-
dy and suitable for the climate, of Britain,-and it has also the; advantage of growing
more rapidly when young; so that it may yet become one of the most valuable of
the Contfera whether as a timber or an ornamental tree, It is a native of the Hi-                          
malaya mountain, where trees 150 feet high, without branches, and 80 feet in cir-
circumference, are not unconcern; some are even larger. If the Deodoran be grafted
on the cedar of Lebanon, it will make a tree much sooner than upon its own bottom.
Many fine plants are spoiled by being grafted on larches, merely because cedars of
Lebanon are expensive stocks.
