                       I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL, HISTORY.
       THERE were originally two parishes, Kilspindie and Rait;
     but at what period their union took place, has not been ascertain-

     Rait are Still standing.
       Extent land Boundaries.--The form of the parish is oblong;
     its length from south-east to northwest, being about 5 miles ; and
     its greatest breadth, from south-west to north-east, about 31/2 miles
     It is bounded on the south and south-east, by the parish of Er-
     rol ; on the south-west and west, by Kinfauns; on the north-west
     and north, by St Martins and Collace; and on the east; by Kin-
