   Heritors.-The Earl of Kinnoul, Lord Ruthven, and Co-
lonel Belches of Invermay, are the principal proprietors
in the parish.

   Rivers.-The river Earn or Ern flows across the breadth
of the parish, from west to east.  It frequently overflows its
banks, and is thereby the occasion of great damage to the
low grounds through which it runs.-The May is a rivulet
that takes its origin among the Ochil-hills, at the distance
of about eight miles from the Earn, into which, after a
greatly variegated course, it is lost, a little to the eastward of
a stone bridge of 6 arches, built about 30 years ago, very
near the place where the ferry-boat or coble formerly was.  It
sometimes descends from the hills with great rapidity, making
considerable devastations on the banks and the adjacent
grounds.  On these occasions, the passage to the church, from
some parts of the country, is rendered very circuitous and
difficult.-Invermay, the residence of Colonel Belches of
Invermay, is situated a short way from the church, on the
banks of the May, in one of the most romantic and plea-
sant spots in this part of Perthshire.  This is the place that
gave rise to the well-known ballad of the Birks of Inver-
may.  The mansion-house, which is not of an old  date, is
neat and commodious, and makes a striking contract with
an old tower, which is permitted to remain, in its vicinity.
The banks are covered with wood, both natural and plant-
ed; among which the birk (birch) holds a conspicuous
place, and perpetuates the scenery alluded to in the ballad
already mentioned.-The water and banks of the May ex-
hibit some natural curiosities, that deservedly attract the at-
tention of strangers.  The Humble Bumble, in particular, is
extremely remarkable.  This name is given to a narrow
course which the water has cut for itself a considerable way
