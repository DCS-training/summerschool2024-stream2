   Besides these there is a cart and plough manufactory,
which employs 13 wrights and 4 blacksmiths.  There is a
tannery doing remarkably well; and in the neighbourhood
of the town there is a bleachfield, which, if properly attend-
ed to, will likewise turn out to advantage.  The tannery and
bleachfield were set on foot by the exertions of one of the
proprietors, assisted by the public spirit of several gentlemen
of the county, and merchants in town, who subscribed for
the purpose.  In order to encourage a public brewery, very
much wanted, the same gentleman has disposed of a part of
his property in town, on the most moderate terms, to one
of the inhabitants, willing to undertake such a work; and
the buildings requisite for the purpose are now erecting on
an extensive scale.  There is every reason to expect that the
brewery will prove a profitable concern to the proprietor,
and an useful work to the public; that it will lessen the
consumption of spirits, and supersede the importation of
London porter, which has of late years been growing to an
extensive height.
