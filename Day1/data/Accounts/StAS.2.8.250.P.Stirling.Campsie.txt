causes and results than ordinary floods must be referred to in
accounting satisfactorily for these extensive and irregular deposits-
Nearer the base of the fells, the soil is generally a light clay on a
tilly subsoil, both being much infested with  boulder stones and
fragments of sandstone and trap rocks, small and large. The lower
hill, on  south side of the valley, is chiefly clayey, and of
similar character, and the slopes betwixt it and the Kelvin are
light loam, gravelly, sandy, alluvial, and mossy. Excepting about
400 acres covered with heath, and about 200 with woods, the south
hill is all arable. There is very little heath on the north hills.
On the top of one of them, there are about 300 acres of deep un-
prodtictive moss. The rest of these hills, with very trifling excep-
tions, yield pasturage of first-rate quality, bardly surpassed, in-
deed, by any hill pasture lands in Scotland.
   Leases, Rent of Land, &c.--The leases are generally for nine-
teen years, the entry being at Martinmas and Whitsunday, and
the first year's rent payable at Martinmas and Wliitsonday there-
after. On land fit for green cropping, the tenants are usually
bound to the following rotation, viz. 1. crop oats; 2. potatoes and
turnips ; 3. barley, wheat, or oats ; 4. bay; 5 and 6. 'pasture.
On the deep alluvial soils, and on the poor wet clay soils, a diffe-
rent course is commonly pursued according to circumstances, as
in the one case, taking two white. crops in succession, and sowing
down, and in the other, breaking up the hay stubbles, &c. What
may be styled iin ordinary sized farm on the best class of arable
land, here, contains about 120 Scotch acres; a few possessions are
greater, and many much less. The rent paid for such a farm is
about L. 300. In one or two instances, L. 4 per acre are paid for
some fields, in a very few others, L. 3, lbs.; but on the clayey
soils, L.2, and down, to L. 1, is the rent for tillage land. The
greatest amount of rent paid by any one tenant in the parish is
L. 690, the next about L. 400. On a farm of the size and kind
first described, viz. containing 120 acres, the live-stock may be
about twenty milk cows, ten young cattle, and five or six working
horses, and one or two oung horses.
