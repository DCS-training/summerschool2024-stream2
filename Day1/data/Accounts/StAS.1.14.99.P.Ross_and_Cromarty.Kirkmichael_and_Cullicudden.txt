take the advantage of this favourable circumstance, if
proper lint-mills were erected, and premiums given to
allure them to the attempt.  Surely the trustees for the
improvement of manufactures, etc. cannot suppose, that
inducements of that nature are now so necessary in
southern counties, where manufactures have been long
established, and where the method and advantage of rais-
ing lint and hemp are well understood, as in these north-
ern districts, where they are hardly known, and where
the people are in that low state of poverty and depres-
sion, which has ever been found to check and smoother a
spirit of industry and improvement.
   Besides these, converting all, or, at least, one half of
the victual-rents into money, at a moderate rate; giving
long leases, with melioration for enclosing the farms, and
abolishing thirlage, would have a powerful tendency to
rouse a spirit of improvement among the farmers, and
render the situation of the people in general much more
easy and comfortable than it is at present.  Giving pre-
miums to farmers for fallowing and liming their ground,
sowing turnips and grass-seeds in their fields, would,
no doubt, excite a spirit of emulation and industry
among them.  And as these are the great and truly pa-
triotic objects which the lately formed Ross-shire farm-
ing-society has in view, it is not doubted, but every
gentleman of property, in the counties of Ross and
Cromarty, will give it his hearty countenance and sup-
port.  Were they to contribute to the common stock
according to their rentals, and pay particular attention
to such tenants as should compete for premiums, though
they should not succeed, a spirit of improvement might
be soon excited in this country, similar to that which
arose in Aberdeenshire, from a farmer-society, formed
