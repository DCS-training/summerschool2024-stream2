improvement in agriculture, the land in general being more
proper for sheep-pasture than for tillage.  When the seasons
are favourable, and the harvest early, the crops of grain are
very good; but it sometimes happens, in unfavourable sea-
sons, that damage is done to the grain by frosts.  In this cafe,
the people are obliged to purchase seed for the ensuing year
from other places at a great expence.  This renders them a-
verse to cultivate the quantity of land they otherwise might;
there being only 20 ploughs kept in the parish, which, on an
average do not labour above 30 acres each.  The rise that 
has happened in the price of sheep, tends also to produce an
indifference about tillage.  Besides, the cultivation of land
for grain requires much laborious work, while the manage-
ment of a store or sheep farm is attended with ease and lei-
sure.  There are about 20 larger and smaller farms in the pa-
rish, each of which have ground proper for both tillage and
pasture.  The sheep reared on these farms are of good qua-
lity; particular on Gilkerseleugh mains, from which ground
tups and wool have been produced that obtained public pre-
miums.  The number of sheep in the parish is said to be a-
bove 12,000, though it cannot easily be ascertained.  The
number of black cattle in likewise considerable.

   Natural Productions and Seats.-The natural productions
are, oats, of which each farmer fows from 10 to 50 bolls;
bear, of which only from 1/2 to 4 bolls are fown on each farm;
a little pease; small quantities of flax; and some potatoes.
There is not much sown grass here, the ground being gene-
rally open, and not senced from the sheep; but meadow, or
bog hay, is cut on almost every farm.-There are 2 gentle-
men's seats in the parish, Gilkerscleugh and Glespine.  At the
former, a stranger is agreeably surprised to find, in so high a
situation, inclosures laid, out with much taste and propriety.
