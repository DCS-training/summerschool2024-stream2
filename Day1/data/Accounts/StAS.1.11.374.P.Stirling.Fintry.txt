ficial effect of this method, has encouraged some of his own
tenants to follow his example; and there is no doubt but
the practice will become general in all those farms upon
which the enclosures are sencible against sheep.  The method
alluded to consists, as was mentioned, in cleaning the ground
with turnips and potatoes; in sowing next year bear with
grass feeds; in raising hay for two years; in pasturing one
or two; in sowing oats for two years; and then in returning
to the turnips.  This routine answers very well, and, with
the single improvement of taking only one crop of each
kind, and pasturing two years, is best adapted for this soil,
which, being light, is soon impoverished by a continuation of
crops, and if not regularly cleaned by pasturing and crops of
turnips, is apt to be over-run with the creeping wheat-grass,
known by the vulgar name felt, or pirl-grass.  There is
no soil better adapted for raising potatoes, of which the in-
habitants plant considerable quantities; after which they
commonly sow flax-seed, which succeeds very well, yielding
from three to four stone from each peck sown.

few exceptions, confined to grazing*, which is by far the

*Under this article it is but justice to mention the name of DAVID DUN, a
man whose exertion, in impressing the mode of grassing, are truly laudable, and
to whose example its present advanced state, through a considerable part of the
west of Scotland, is in a great measure owing.  He has the merit of first im-
proving the breed of black cattle and sheep, by raising them to a greater size,
and feeding them more throughly, that was done before upon grass alone.
This he has accomplished, by judiciously selecting the most choice cattle, to stock
his farms with, and by keeping his grass lighter, i. c. b putting fewer cattle
upon the same space of ground, than what had been used in former times-As
a specimen of his success in this branch, the winter flares the following facts,
which are well attested.  At one time he told a Highland stot, which was kill-
