consisted of about 24 houses only; and probably contained not
many more than 100 souls.  It now contains upwards of 1000.
For this great increase various causes may be assigned.  A-
bout 30 years ago, a considerable herring fishing took place
at the mouth of the river very near the town.  This fishing
continued for 2 or 3 years.  By the concourse of people it
drew together, and by the wealth it produced, a sudden and
considerable extension of the town was occasioned.  The 
throwing of a number of small farms together, which, at one
period, was frequently practised in this country, with al-

number of families to take up their residence in the towns
and villages.  The practice of smuggling, too, which, for a
number of years, was carried on to a considerable extent on
this coast, contributed, in no small degree, to the increase of
the town of Girvan.

   Productions, etc.-The number of trees is very small.
There is scarcely any natural wood better than brush-wood.
A few trees have been planted in the low part of the parish,
and in sheltered situations have grown tolerably well.  It is
believed, that on many parts of the high grounds, trees might
be reared with success and advantage.  All the low part of
the parish is capable of bearing grain; and, with the exception
of a few enclosures near the shore, has been chiefly employ-
ed for that purpose.  Considerable advances have been made,
within these 30 years, in the improvement of agriculture.
The low lands have been almost wholly enclosed.  By the
proper use of lime, marl, and sea-weed, together with a more
regular rotation of crops, the produce, both in quantity and
quality, has been, to a great degree encreased.  Oats, barley,
bear, pease, beans, and potatoes, are the only kinds of crops
commonly raised.  A small quantity of wheat and rye is oc-
