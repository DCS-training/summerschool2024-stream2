and on the south-west, by the parish of Holme.  It is about
six miles long, and from one to three miles broad; and is
joined to the peninsula of Deerness by a narrow neck of
land, about a mile long.  Tradition says, that this peninsula
was once frequented by deers, from whence the name
Deerness.  In Gaelic, which may have been the language
of the country under the Pictish kingdom, Dearness, or
Durness, signifies a peninsulated promontory.  It lies south-

Deer Sound; and the rest of its shores are washed by the
German Ocean.  From the Mull-head to the Isthmus, it is
four and a half miles long, and varies in breadth from one
to three miles.

   Soil, Culture, and Crops.-The parish of St Andrews is
in general flat; and the soil is loam and moss interpersed
with stones, upon a deep cold clay and tilly bed.  Hence it
is naturally wet and boggy in many places.  It is stiff to
plough, and, in general, from the want of manure, is not
very productive.  Around the shores of Deerness, sand
prevails most; higher up, it is loam and clay; and the
middle of this parish is extremely boggy and wet.  The
waste lands and undivided common in both parishes, are
of far greater extent than the arable land; and, were suffi-
cient encouragement given, or the people able, might be
improved.  Sea-weed or ware is the most common ma-
nure, and where it is scarce, a compost formed of ware and
earth.  The plough with one stilt, was the only plough ge-
nerally used till within these few years, when it has given
way to a wretched imitation of the Scots plough.  Horses
only are employed by farmers in the plough, and those
of the small Strathnaver and Shetland breed.  Oxen are
little used, except in carts.  Till within these seven years,
there were no carts in these parishes but what belonged to
