fiderable expence and perseverance.  The common people
make use of turf, broom and fuize; but these two last have
become scarce, through cultivation of the land that formerly
produced them.  Peats are not plentiful, there being no mosses
but in places where the marl is got; and thin being nearly
exhausted, the poorer inhabitants must suffer considerably very
soon by the want of this article: and indeed the distance from
coal is one great reason that manufactures have not been
established in this country, though wool is in great abundance,
and the necessaries of life may be obtained for the most part
at moderate rates.

   Population.-The population in 1756 was about 890 souls
above the age of 8.  It has often varied according to circum-
stances.  An accurate state of baptisms cannot be obtained,
as dissenters from the establishment seldom order the names
of their children to be engrossed; and the register of births,
marriages and burials is not regularly kept, as the parish
clerk has no allowance for that purpose.  The dues to govern-
ment for there are paid on the first of October yearly: of there
he preserves a memorandum, and afterwards enters them on
the records, according to which the annexed abstract* will
furnish some idea of the population for ten years past.
