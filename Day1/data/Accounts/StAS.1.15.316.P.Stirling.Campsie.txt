not appear unnatural.

   External Appearance and Soil.-It would not be easy to re-
duce the superficial appearance of this parish to any regular
figure; it can neither be said that it is a square, a parallelo-
grams, or a triangle; the irregular bending of the hills prevents
the eye from comprehending it in one view, and the bound-
ing lines of the parish have never been accurately measured:
in loose terms, it may be laid to consist of two hills, with a
considerable valley or strath between them; the South hill

seven hundred feets arable to the top.-Between this South
brae and the North hill, (better known by the name of
Campsie Fells,) there is a considerable strath, narrow indeed
on the West, but as it runs East, it widens into an open
champaign country.  The surface of the strath is uneven, ex-

the land can be styled rugged or broken; for almost on every
side of the gentle swells, with which this strath abounds, some
small rivulets collect the waters from the rising grounds; so
that, even supposing the arable part of the parish to be in the
highest state of cultivations the husbandman would neither
find it easy nor expedient to plow the ridges long in one di-
rection.-One meets with boggy, stannery, croft, and clay
ground, almost in every farm.-The haughs which ly upon
the Glazert and Kelvins are composed of carried earth,
brought down from the hills in floods; of course, those upon
the Glazert, as being nearer the hills, contain a considerable
quantity of gravel, and are better calculated for raising pota-
toes, and turnip.  The Kelvin haughs, on the other hand,
