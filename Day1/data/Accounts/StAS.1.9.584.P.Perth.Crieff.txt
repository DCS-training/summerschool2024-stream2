the serene air, and the day healthy situation, have induced
people of taste and science, who frequently reside there
during the summer months to account it the pelier
of Scotland.  Crieff is in bulk the second town in Perth-
shire.  The parish in its utmost extent may be divided in-
to the highland and lowland parts, which are detached
from each other by the intervention of the parish of Mon-
zie.  The most considerable district of the former is the
long Strath of Glenalmond, the property of the Duke of
Athole, through which the Almond runs a course of 8

rivers are all furnished with stone bridges, generally built
