     Statistical Account

the two ports of Berwick and Eyemouth, is now agitating
among the proprietors, but not yet settled.-There was a
considerable common in the environs of Dunse, consisting
of several hundred acres, a few years ago, that has been
divided; by which a large piece of land, which had been
for ages past an eye-sore to every traveller, and of no value
to any, is now an ornament to the neighbourhood, and pro-
fitable to many.-We have abundance of freestone quar-
ries in the parish, and also in the neighbourhood, the rock
lying from 3 feet to 10 below the surface.  There is also
an inexhaustible fund of whinstone within a mile of the
town, all above ground, lying in immense large slabs, one
upon another, and may be broken into the shape of flags,
with the least trouble, and of any size.  We are 15 miles
distant from coal, and bring them all from Northumber-
land, as also our lime.-On the 18th September 1790, was
found, 3 miles S.E. from Dunse, a bird very rare in Scot-
land.  It was killed by a cat, and discovered to be the bird
called Hoopoe by the English, Wedhop by the Germans,
the Upupa of the ancients, described by Pliny, Aristotle,
Pausanias, AElian, &c.  The bird is common in Germany,
and sometimes even in England.  A few days after, ano-
ther Upupa, of a greener colour, was seen flying about the
garden at Kimmergham, but soon disappeared.-There is
a very remarkable wall in the parish, inclosing near 100
acres of ground, called Borthwick Park, belonging to the 
family of Langton; it is of moorstone, without any sort of 
mortar, and never had any covering, either of sod or any
thing else; it has stood 179 years, and never was known
to need any repair till within these 4 years; and though
it is but low, yet, in consequence of the unevenness of its
texture, and the ruggedness of its top, neither horses nor
cattle ever ventured to leap it.
