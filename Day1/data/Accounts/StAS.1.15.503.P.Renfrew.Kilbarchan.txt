the former rent.  Johnston mill, the property of the Milliken
family, has the estate bound in thirlage; but, at renewing
the leases, the thirlage was rendered more moderate.  At
the other 2 mills, the thirlage varies from the 12th to the
30th peck.  At all, they must pay, even if they should sell
their oats unground.  All grain but oats is free.  It is to
be hoped chat this barbarous Gothic practice, which produces
on the one hand, constant complaints of evasion, on the other,
of slovenly execution, will be wholly extirpated from Scotland.

   Manufactures.-The Messrs Darbours first established a
candle manufactory in Kilbarchan, which acquired great ce-
lebrity:  afterwards a manufactory of linens was attempted
by them in the year 1739.  In the year 1742, Mr Spiers and
others introduced the manufacture of lawns, cambrics, &c.
for the Dublin market, which branch still continues,
with different variations in the quantity produced.  When
the Paisley silks came into vogue, a considerable proportion
was wrought up here.  Afterwards, the cotton manufactory
almost superseded every other.  In the year 1774, Semple, in
his History of Renfrewshire, reckoning every weaver of linen
to produce 65 L. per annum, calculated the manufactures car-
reid on by persons redding in Kilbarchan, at 23,400 L. per
annum.  If we reckon the cottons and other stuffs at the
same rate, in the year 1791, the value manufactured in the
parish of Kilbarchan, would be 27,105 L.  This is not all done
by people residing here, but a considerable quantity of muslins
are sent from Paisley to be weaved.  This year, 1794, all
branches of business are in a very languid state.  The only
branch that still does a little, is the lawn, but even this is
very dull, and the people seem much dispirited.
   There are in the village, 3 bleachfields, which employ 30
hands, mostly women.  There are also 2 candleworks, and
a brewery.
