ply of articles of the first necessity require.
   The village of lnnerleithen, from its situation, boasts of
many advantages.  Pleasantly situated on Leithen-water,
near its junction with Tweed, in the heart of a country
whose staple is wool, in which provisions of all kinds are
plentiful, it seemed formed by nature for a site of woollen
manufacture.  What must have occurred to every one
since the value of manufactures were known in this coun-

An infant manufacture, in a country truly pastoral, has many
disadvantages.  The whole operations of teazing and card-

floors; the first and second of which are occupied by the
operations performed by water, and which, had circum-
stances been favourable, would have by this time been far-

structions, occupy the two next.  The highest is a store-
room for the raw material.  From 27 to 80 hands are em-
ployed within doors, and as many at least without the ma-
nufactory Children from seven years of age are employed
in the operations of teazing and carding and earn 2 s. 6 s. per
week.  The best spinners can make 18 s. per week.  The
