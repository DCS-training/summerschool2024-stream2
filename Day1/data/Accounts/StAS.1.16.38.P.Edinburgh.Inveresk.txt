ever, that a considerable quantity of Edinburgh bread is 
also vended here.  The necessaries of life are not doubt
much dearer than they were thirty or forty years ago, but 
the wages of labour have increased in a much greater pro-
portion.  For 12 years preceding 1760, the price of beef
here by agreement was 2 1/2 d. for one half of the year, and
3 d. for the other half.  It is now at the rate of 3 1/2 d. and
4 d.  But the wages of labour have, in most cafes, been
more than doubled since that period; so that the interior 
classes, who subsist by their labour, and are understood 
chiefly to use the necessaries of life, and not its luxuries, 
have no ground of complaint.  On the contrary, their
condition is much improved, especially as the taxes do not 
extend to many articles of their consumption.  Soap, can-
dles, and leather are the only necessaries that are taxed 
which are within their reach.  If they will have whisky,
it is fit they should pay for it.  Malt liquor is still very
cheap, viz. I 1/2 d. per pint, or 2 English quarts, though it
must be owned, it is inferior in quality to what it for-
merly was, on account of the high price of barley; which, 
it is to be hoped, may not be of long continuance, as the 
first very good crop may reduce it as much as was done in 
the year 1779.

   If any class of men have ground of complaint amidst the
high prosperity of their country, it is those of ranks su-
perior to the labourers and artisans, who, having fixed sa-
laries, or unimprovable livings, cannot now afford to live 
as they have formerly done; many articles for the table, 
besides butcher's meat, which has been raised above one
fourth, having been doubled or tripled within these 40 
years.  But still it is more owing to the change in the
modes of living, than to the increased price of provisions, 
that difficulties are incurred; for this creates a necessity of
