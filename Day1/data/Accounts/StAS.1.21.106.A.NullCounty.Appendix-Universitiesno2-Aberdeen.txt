     Statistical Account of the

rischal, as a proper scite for the College.  The charter also
contains a grant of the property of the Carmelites lying at
Bervie, where they had a small convent, and of the revenues
of the chapel of St. Mary at Cowie, both in Mearns: but
these last mentioned were resumed by the son and successor
of the founder.

   Original Members.-The original members consisted of a
Principal, three regents or masters in philosophy and lan-
guages, six bursars, an oconomus and cook.

   Duty of the Principal.-The duty of the Principal is de-
clared to be, to attend to the whole University, and to every
one of its members, and to exercise, with regard to them, or-
dinary jurisdiction.  He is required to be well informed in
the holy scriptures, in order to qualify him for opening the
mysteries of religion, and the hidden treasures of the word
of God; to be well skilled in the languages, especially the
Hebrew and Syriac, which were to be taught by him once
every week.  He is appointed to explain the sacred writings
one hour every Monday; to illustrate, from the Greek, the
Physiology of Aristotle, beginning where the third or highest
regent had left off, to which was to be added a short expli-
cation of anatomy; to teach the principles of geography,
chronology and astronomy, as also the Hebrew grammar, to-
gether with some practical application of the rules; to confer
the degree of master of arts on those students who, after
passing through the usual course of four years, should be
found deserving of that distinction; and to superintend the
public discipline of the College.  He is likewise, in the char-
ter, required, together with the chancellor, rector and dean
of faculty, to prescribe the authors to be explained to the
students, in the languages in which they originally wrote.
