rants, thrive well, and in good seasons come to perfection, and are
particularly fine-flavoured.    Strawberries in the gardens, and
craw-berries on the hills, ripen well and are abundant.  Rhubarb,
mint, and every kind of vegetable usually raised in the kitchen,
garden, are raised here in perfection.

   Parochial Registers.-The acts or minutes of session commence
in 1733, and are contained in one volume.  They appear to have
been regularly kept from that period, till about 1765; but between
the death or demission of one minister and the admission of another,
little care seems to have been taken of the register; so that
now, it is in a very shattered and imperfect state.
   Antiquities.-The small island, called Kirk-holm, in the mouth
of Selivoe, presents every appearance of having at one time been
put in a state of defence.  A breast--work of earth round the
most accessible parts of the island, i. e. on the west, north, and
part of the east sides, is still visible; and the foundations of nine
houses, for the accommodation of those who may have fortified
themselves in it, can also be traced.  Two of the houses, which
have been erected at the north end of the holm, stood north and
south, with their door towards the west, and measure each 38
feet long by 12 feet broad inside.  At a distance of 42 feet to
the southward, is the foundation of another house of 28 feet long.
