the kirk was long called, (supposed by way of sobriquet,) Kirk
covenant.
	Eminent Characters.--Under this head, may be mentioned,
Andrew M'Douall, Lord Bankton, one of the Judges of the
Court of Session, and author of" Institutes of the Laws of Scot-
land."  He was son of Robert M'Douall, Esq. of Logan, and
Sarah Shaw, daughter of Sir John Shaw of Greenock, and was
born at Logan, about the year 1685, and died at Bankton, in East
Lothian, in 1760. Lord Bankton was thrice married; but none
of his marriages was productive of children. His character as a
lawyer and a judge was only equalled by his character in all the
relations of life. The estate of Bankton, which had previously
belonged to the celebrated Colonel Gardiner, descended, on his
Lordship's death, tn the head of his family, and still belongs to
the M'Doualls of Logan. (Murray's Literary History of Gal-
loway.)
	Robert M'Douall, Admiral of the Blue Squadron in his Ma-
jesty's Fleet, and who had formerly held a similar rank in the Por-
tuguese service, was the son of Alexander M'Douall, and Mary
Gordon in Portnessock; born in 1729, and died at Stranraer 1826.
	Land-Owners.--The land-owners of this parish were formerly
numerous; at present, there are only four, and the property of one
of them is too small to entitle him to a voice in any parochial mat-
ter. Their names and proportions of rent, according to the old Scots
valuation, are as follows: Major M'Douall of Logan, L. 3181, 15s.;
the Earl of Stair, L.853, 10s.; John M'Taggart, Esq. of Ard-
well, L.358, 15s.; Captain Maitland of Freuch, L.6. Total,
L. 4400.
