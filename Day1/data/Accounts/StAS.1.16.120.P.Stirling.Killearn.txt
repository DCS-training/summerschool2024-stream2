     Statistical Account

at three fairs annually held in the village of Killearn.
Scots cloth is sold from 10 d. to 5 s. 6 d. per yard;
harn from 8 d. to 1 s. 5 d.; linen from 1 s. 6 d. to 3 s.
   By a community so actively employed, little time is
wasted in idleness, intemperance, or political cabals.  There
are, however five public houses in the parish, but they are
chiefly frequented by travellers.  Two turnpike-roads,
lately made through the parish, are of great service to the
inhabitants.  The statute-labour, which is mostly raised in
money at 18 s. Sterling per L. 100 Scots of valued rent, is
applied to private roads, which are still far from being in a
good condition.
   The greatest impediment to improvements in this part
of the country is the scarcity of good fuel.  The nearest coal
is in Campsie or Baldernock, at the distance of 10 or 12
miles.  The price at the hill is 1 s. 6 d. the cart-load, con-
taining about 12 cwt.  The carriage comes to about 4 s.  The
scarcity of coal is supplied by turf and peat, for obtaining
which the feuars and tenants have a servitude on the moors.
The turf is procured by setting fire to the grass and heath
about the month of June, and then raising the surface with
what is called a flaughter spade.  This practice greatly in-
jures the moors by depriving them of their verdure, which
necessarily requires several years to be renewed.  The loss,
however, is in some measure repaid by the great quantity
of ashes for manure, procured from this kind of fuel.

   Religion.-With respect to the state of religion, few obser-
vations occur that merit the attention of the public.  The peo-
ple in general regularly attend divine service in the parish
church.  There are only about 12 adherents to the different
parties of Seceders.  Several respectable clergymen, since
the reformation from Popery, have successively been mi-
nisters of the parish, as Mess, Forster, Gillespie, Sempell and
