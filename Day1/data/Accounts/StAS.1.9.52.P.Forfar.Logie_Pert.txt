bracelet by some person of distinction.  In the same tumu-
lus, at about 4 feet from the surface, was found an urn full
of ashes, something in the shape of a common bottle with-
out a bottom, lying horizontally, with the neck end close,
and of a substance resembling a crucible.  There were like-
wise discovered in the same place several cavities, near 6
feet from the surface.  The third and largest of the three
Laws, which has not yet been broken up, contains a space
equal to the 1/8 of an acre, nearly circular, with a sort of
fosse round it, filled up with round stones, intermingled
with pieces of glass.  There is reason to believe, that these
Laws, if duly examined, would be found to contain many
more bones, urns, &c.: but there is no tradition concern-
ing them, by which it can be ascertained whether they
have been raised by the Danes or Romans, or ancient Cale-
donians.  Mention is made by Buchanan in his history of
Scotland, to which Gordon alludes in his Itenerarium Sep-
tentrionale, that about 1000 years ago, a little before the
celebrated battle of Luncarty, in the reign of Swino, a par-
ty of Danes landed at the mouth of the Esk, and fought in
that neighbourhood several skirmishes with the Scots; and
it is not improbable but these Laws or mounds might have
then been raised, in burning or burying the slain.  Or, as
Law is a word of Saxon origin, perhaps these tumuli might
have been begun by the Saxons, who, at a very early pe-
riod, are said to have made incursions all along the coast of
this island.  The three Laws, with the adjacent ground,
have been lately inclosed and planted by the proprietor of
Craigo.-East from the above Laws, in a straight line, and
within a plantation of Craigo's, are three large stones set up
on end, with two others very near them, in a similar posi-
tion; and to the east of all are the remains of a circular
fort of building, about 16 yards in diameter.  The ground
