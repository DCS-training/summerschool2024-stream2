An awkward addition of two good rooms was made to the manse,
at the induction of the last incumbent, now upwards of twenty years
ago, at an expense fully equal to the half of what it would have
cost to build a substantial new house. The house has ever since been
in need of repair of some kind or other. An addition was made to the
offices attached to the manse, in the course of last spring, which ren-
ders them very comfortable. The stipend annexed to the cure by
decreet of the Court of Teinds in 1811, is 100 bolls, 2 firlots, 2
pecks, 3 lippies of barley; 88 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 pecks, 6 lippies of
meal; 36 bolls of oats, and such a further quantity of victual, half
meal, half barley, as shall be equal to 100 merks Scots money, to-
gether with L. 100 Scots money for communion elements. The
stipend awarded by the Court has never been realized, owing to a
deficiency of teind, and the clergyman has never been paid more
than a sum equal to 13.1 chalders, out of which he has to defray the
expense of communion elements,-a sum totally inadequate to the
nature of the situation and the great population of the parish. The
glebe consists of 6.1 acres, and is worth about L. 30 Sterling per
annum, although it has sometimes been let for more./f*
  Besides the Established Church, there is one dissenting or Se-
ceding chapel, now in connection with the United Associate Synod.
The congregation belonging to it was originally formed for the re-
ception of Mr Thomas Nairne to be their  pastor, who, we have al-
ready mentioned, was deposed from being minister of Abbotshall
in 1740, in consequence of espousing the principles of the old
dissenters, relative to the existing civil government. Mr Nairne
afterwards withdrew from the communion of the Seceders, and
joined the Reformed Presbytery. He at length deserted their com-
munion, and returned to the fellowship of the Established Church,
after making humiliating confessions to the presbytery of Kirkaldy,

<FOOTNOTE>The following is a list of the different clergymen who have successively filled the
cure at Abbotshall, with the date of their admission, &c. so far as can he ascertained
from the imperfect registers of presbytery and kirk-session. The first found on re-
cord is Mr Patrick Wemyss, who was ordained November 4, 1650. He was the
son of the Laird of Foodie. Mr Wemyss became a landed proprietor, after which
be seems to have abandoned the ministry. The next mentioned is Mr Robert For-
rest in 1664. Mr John Bowes was deposed from the ministry at Abbotsball, on the
15th October 1691, for heterodoxy in opposing the Assembly's Catechism. Mr Alex-
ander Fraser was admitted 5th January 1692 and seems to have died in 1709. Mr
Thomas Nairne was admitted 7th Sepiember 1710, and was deposed in 1740, for ad-
hering to the secession, which was begun by Erakine and Monerieff. Mr George
Gib was admitted 1972, and died 1758. Mr Alexander Spiers was admitted March
1758, and was translated to Kirkaldy in 1768. Mr George Shaw was admitted 1769,
