     Statistical Account

   The inhabitants are, in general, of an obliging, kind, hos-
pitable disposition to one another, and also to strangers; es-
pecially when, on particular occasions, as at weddings, bap-
tisma, etc. they have it in their power to gratify that spirit
of importance, which they possess, by furnishing entertain-
ments in a stile superior to what might be expected from
their stations and circumstances in life.  On there occasions,
the highest compliment which the guests can confer on their
entertainer, is to sit to a very late hour, and to partake freely
of the best things set before them.^

^It is to be lamented that the heritors, not only in this district, but through
Orkney, in general, are not so ready, as might be expected, to unite with the
ministers of the gospel in promoting the cause of religion and virtue, with re-

moreover, do frequently manifest a disinclination to build or repair suitable
kirks and manses, and to make a decent provition for the support of the cler-

blished clergymen, with their families, greatly distressed.
   The issue of some tedious and expensive law suits, it is to be hoped, will
not only open the eyes of the laity to their own interest, but the present state
of public affairs will, at is presumed, effectually convince them that the inte-
rests of the clergy, of the laity, and of all ranks in society, are so blended and
mutually connected, that it is true wisdom and sound policy, to strengthen
by combining, rather than to weaken by dividing them; especially as a sui-
table provision, and the accomodation of kirks and manses, are essentially re-
quisite to the decent and regular discharge of a clergyman's office, which con-
sists chiefly in explaining and in calculating the doctrines and precepts of our
holy religion; which well invariably be found the most effectual means to
secure a due subordination of ranks in society; which subordinations is es-
sential to the happiness of the community, as well as the best means to pro-
mote the spiritual and temporal interest of individuals.
   The common people of this district remain to this day so credulous, as to
think that fairies do exist; that an inferior species of witch-craft is still prac-
tised, and that houses have been haunted, not only in former ages, but that
