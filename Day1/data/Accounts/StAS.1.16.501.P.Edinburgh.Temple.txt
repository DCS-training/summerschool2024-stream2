cold climate upon strong land only*.  A few Carnwath oats
are also sown here, they are about 10 days earlier than the
common oats, and produce a greater quantity both of oats
and straw upon bad land than either of the other kinds,
but are long in the body, and hulsky.  When sown upon good
land they produce an exellent crop of good grain.  The 
oats are either fold in the Dalkeith market, the best grain
market in Scotland, or made into meal for the use of the
farmer's family.  The pease sown are either the late feed,
the Peebles and Magbiehill, or Montgomery pease.  The
Last of these is the earliest.  The country is indebted for
them to the late Mr Montgomery of Magbiehill; they
are chiefly made into meal and used in the sane way.
The horsed are improved in size and strength; the cattle
are larger and better formed than formerly; a cow feeds
to from 24 to 34 stones, an ox to from 30 to 46.  The 
breed of sheep is the same which has long prevailed in the
southern districts of Scotland, viz. the black-faced and grey-
faced coarse-woolled sheep.  They are much better, boned,
from fewer being kept upon the same ground than former-
ly, and weigh, when fed, from 20 lb. to 26 lb. a quarter.
As many sheep are reared in the parish, they are disposed
of in the following manner:  Some are sold when lambs
to the butcher; others when hogs, or of one year old;
others as fat ewes; other ewes, when lean, at Martinmas,
for feeding or keeping; and a few are sold young wedders,
or three years old.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The red oats have been long in this country, and were formerly
known by the name of barley corn.  They were brought fron Lunton,
Peebleshire, by Mr Dawson, farmer at Frogden, Roxburghshire, and
meliorated, by being sown upon his well-cultivated land.  They were
introduced-lately into this country under the title of red oats.
