Such is the wealth of this parish, as nearly as can be stated
-from the returns made by the mastei-s of public works, by the
master artisans of the different trades, and by the active and per-
sonal survey of an intelligent and skilful farmer, with respect to the
produce of the land and dairy, and amount of stock.
           V.-PAROCHIIAL ECO.WOMY.
There are no towns in the parish; but the villages of Neilstou
and Barrhead may be considered as approaching to that charactdr.
Though there is now a population of 9187 in the parish, there is
neither a magistrate, nor police,, nor jail in iL The whole is
kept in order by active Justices of the Peace, with a constabulmy
at their cotpmand. - There is a small-debt court held in Neilston
and Barrhead, alternately, once every mouth, by the Justices. . On
these occasions, they have their legal assessor and clerl Neilston
is not a niarket-town. The nearest markettown is Paisley, but
there is no occasion to go thither for any thing almost, that is need-
ed. Every article and convenience of life is to be had in the parish.
