1789, when, in order to try the effects of a plan of soli-
tary confinement and labour, some buildings belonging
to the city, and formerly used as granaries, were fitted up
as separate cells, for the confinement of persons guilty of
crimes meriting such punishment.  These have been gra-
dually increased to the number of 64, where the prisoners
are kept separate from one another, and employed in
such labour as they can perform, under the management of
a keeper, and under the inspection of a committee of
council, who enquire into the keeper's management, etc.

of their labour, and after defraying the expence of their
maintenence, the surplus is paid to them, when the period
of their confinement expires; and some have received from

where this institution has been established, has demonstrated,
that of all the species of punishment for offenders of a
certain description, solitary confinement and labour is not
only the most humane, but the best calculated to answer
one great end of punishment, the amendment of the
offender.-Such an establishment is now become absolutely
necessary in a manufacturing city; for several British sta-
tutes assign the house of correction, as the punishment of
workmen and apprentices, who offend against the laws in-

offences arise from a dissolute and idle life.  The growing
manufactures and population of the city requiring more
