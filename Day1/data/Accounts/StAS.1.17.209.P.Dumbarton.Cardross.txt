     NUMBER XV.

     PARISH OF CARDROSS.

     (COUNTY AND PRESBYTERY OF DUMBARTON-SYNOD
     OF GLASGOW AND AYR.)

     By the Rev. Mr ALEXANDER M'AULAY, Minister.

     Situation, Extent, Rivers, Surface, and Soil.

   CARDROSS is washed on the east border by the river Le-
ven, and on the south by the Frith of Clyde.  Its
length, from Dumbarton Bridge to its boundary with the pa-
rish of Row, is about 7 miles; its breadth, from the conflux
of the Leven and Clyde to its junction with the parish of
Bonhill, is 3 miles.  The situation of the parish is peculiarly
beautiful: The Clyde runs for 7 miles along its coast, and,
being partly opposite to the flourishing towns of Port-Glas-
gow and Greenock, it commands a prospect of the whole
shipping, that great source of industry and wealth to the
western part of Scotland.  The ground along the Frith has a
gradual ascent from the shore, for upwards of two miles, till
it terminates in a ridge of hills, which separate it from the
lands in the neighbourhood of Leven and Loch-Lomond.  The
soil contiguous to the shore is of a light gravelly nature; but,
at a short distance, it contains a considerable mixture of clay.
The lands adjacent to the Leven partake something of the
nature of carse.
