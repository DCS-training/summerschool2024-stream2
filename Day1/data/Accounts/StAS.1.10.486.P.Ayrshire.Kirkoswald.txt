shore, had round them about 30 or 40 acres of croft ground.
The rest of the farms went back to the higher grounds of
the parish, and was called out-field.  Their croft land had
been immemorially in tillage, without one year's rest.  They
commonly manured the third part of it with sea-weed, which
they carried upon horses backs (for not one tenant in the
parish had a single cart) during the three months of winter.
At candlemas they ploughed it down.  In the beginning of
May they gave it another fur, and then sowed bear upon it.
This, by the most intelligent, was followed with only one
crop of oats, and then with a crop of pease; and the sea-
weed succeeded the pease crop.  Part of their croft ground
was also manured with dung, which they sowed with bear,
any time between Whitsunday and the end of May.  They
were accustomed to manure such parts of their out-field land
as they wished to plough, by inclosing their cattle upon it
in folds.  From the land thus manured, they generally took
four crops of oats.  It was observed that the crop was always
strongest on those parts of the field, on which the earth that
had composed the fold dyke was spread.  The same mode
of culture took place in the higher grounds, to the south of
what is now the post road.  In process of time, they began
to spread lime, which they brought on horses backs from
the parish of Dailly, upon their folds.  They usually gave
about 20 bolls to the acre, reckoning 2 bushels of shells to
the boll.  From the ground there manured, they took five
crops of oats.  They also began to improve their croft land
with lime, by sowing with the hand, immediately after they
had sown their pease, half a boll of slaked lime to every half
peck of pease.
   About twenty years ago, the husbandry of this parish un-
derwent a total and happy revolution.  The farms were con-
siderably diminished in extent, the boundaries were properly
