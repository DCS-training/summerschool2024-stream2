and it is a hundred to one if he is able to continue.  But
when the rise-rent is progressive, the tenant has no occasion
to dread the issue of his lease, because, unless the improve-
ments be great, there is no variation from one of the com-
mon rises in the progressive scale.  Hence, he is always ac-
tive and industrious, and never defers improvements for the
commencement of a new tack.
   As to the duration of leases, various opinions have been
formed.  Without pretending to judge of a point so uncer-
tain, it may be noticed, that the duration of a lease must de-
pend greatly on the situation of the farm.  If a grass farm,
the only use of a lease is to afford the tenant time for breed-
ing the cattle, and disposing upon them.  Cattle thrive best
on the ground where they have been reared; and the un-
certainty of markets renders it dangerous for a grazier to be
a tenant from year to year only.
   As to arable farms, a variety of circumstances have to
be considered.  1. The state of culture.  2. The manure to
be used.  3. The rotation of crops.  If the ground be
waste, and in need of improvement, the tenant should have
his lease lengthened to encourage him.  If the manure be
quicklime, he cannot be removed so long as the powers of
the lime remain active.  This may be from 6 to 10 years.
If marl is used, the lease must be longer, as this manure
lasts a considerable while.  If a rotation of crops be obser-
ved, the tenant cannot be removed during the rotation.
   From these circumstances, it is plain, that the duration of
a least must depend much on the nature of the farm, and
the plan of management.
   11. Houses.-The houses are much improved of late.
The tenants now begin to perceive the advantage of good
houses, and of living separate from their cattle.
   On the south side of Teith you meet with several
very neat houses, of two stories, covered with slate, and
