villages.
   But as for the mountainous part of the parish, by far the
largest proportion of it in point of territory, it contains on-
ly the 7 poor farms already mentioned, still nearly in a
state of nature; and, from the steepness of their situation, as
well as the barrenness of their soil, likely to continue so
for ever.  The productions of the arable part of these farms
are little more grain, than what is sufficient to support the
farmer's own families, together with some potatoes; for
which, after supplying themselves, they find a ready mar-

as was observed above, that the farmers chiefly depend for
the payment of their rents.

does not supply itself with provisions, no not for a single
week in the year.  The sole dependence of the inhabitants,
for provisions of every kind, is on the neighbouring pa-
rishes, (as far as their fertility, compared with the general
state of population in the country, will admit;) and on Dum-
fries-shire, from which considerable quantities of oats and
oat-meal are imported; but chiefly on Ireland, from
which, not only grain and meal, but almost every other ar-
ticle of provision is brought to this place.

pose of erecting a harbour, this estate was in the possession
of a Sir Patrick Maxwell of Newark; but, at present, it
belongs to William Hamilton, Esq; of Wishaw.  The man-
