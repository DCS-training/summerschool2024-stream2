farmers begin to raise on a large scale, either to feed cattle
for the butcher, or, which is found to be more advantageous,
to give them to their young cattle, as it greatly improves
their size.
   The practice of sowing clover and rye-grass, is daily
gaining ground.  Six pounds of red clover seed, and from
8 to 10 of white, with a bushels of rye-grass, is the general
quantity to an acre.  Hay is taken for two years, and
pasture the third, and then the field is broken up for oats
or barley, according to its state.  A few sow red clover
alone, at the rate of about 20 pounds to the acre.
   Sowing wheat was much run upon, about 20 years ago,
in this parish and the neighbourhood, but now is justly on
the decline; for the returns from the wheat, however high
the price, did not compensate for the injury done to the soil,
by so exhausting a crop.
   Potatoes were introduced into the fields, about 60 years
ago, and are now planted in great quantities all over the
country.  Their quality, from the dryness of the soil, is
excellent, and the produce considerable.  Sometimes they
are exported to Newcastle, and other places.
   Mr Leslie of Balnagight, a very accurate observer, has
lately adopted a method of managing a potatoe crop, which
many imitate with success.  It is this:  He plows his po-
tatoe field before winter, and, if the ground is full of
weeds, propogated from the roots, he plows again before
he plants.  If not, he dungs as for barley, and plants early
in March, putting the seed in every surrow after the plough,
and harrows well immediately after.  As soon as the
weeds get up, and the potatoes begin to appear, (perhaps
one in a square yard or two,) he gives it a third plowing
and harrowing, about the first of May, according as the
plants are advanced.  This culture, with one hoeing when
