the property of the Earl of Hopetoun.

   Agriculture, etc.-Best lands let from L. 1, 10 s. to L. 1,
15 s. the acre.  In general, there are but few cattle bred
here, except what the farmers have occasion for in the
working of their farms, which they labour mostly with
horses.  The cattle they do breed are excellent, both horses
and cows.  Every farmer supplies his stock of horses from
his own breeding mares, which he covers with strong made
stallions from the north of England, of the draught kind;
and sometimes with strong made horses of the road or hunt-
ing kind.  One farmer here thinks the best breed comes
from a stout blood stallion with his own working mares.
Our cows are a mixture of the Holderness kind, with that
of this country.  They are short horned and handsome,
fatten well, and give much milk.  We have had frequent
instances of 20 Scotch pints in the day.  That quantity in-
deed is rather extraordinary, but from 10 to 15 is com-
mon.  Provisions of all kinds, fish excepted, abound in this
parish; and besides, it sends out supplies to the metropolis,
and neighbouring towns.-We sow in the months of March,
April and May, and generally begin to reap in the first
week of September.  There are employed in the parish at
present about 25 ploughs.  The farmers deal much in the
different kinds of sown grass, viz. clovers, rye-grass, tre-
soil, rib-grass, first for hay, and then for pasture.  The
ploughs in general are of Small's construction.  They have
a cast yetland mould-broad, which is curved, and about 1/2
inch thick at the under edge, tapering upwards to about
1/8 inch at the higher edge.  They have plated or winged
socks of iron, shoes and earth-board of the same metal,
with a kneed coulter.  Some have a chain fixed to the
under side of the beam behind, and to the muzzle before,
