     NUMBER XI.

     PARISH OF PORT OF MONTEITH.

     (County of Perth.-Presbytery of Dunblane.-Synod of
     Perth and Stirling.)

     By Mr W. STIRLING.

     Soil and Climate.

   THE parish of Port, in the northern part, is rocky and
mountainous, and mostly covered with heath, there
being only some narrow skirts and hollows capable, of culti-
vation.  The southern parts are more level, and consist of
moss, meadow, dry-field, and carse.  The moss is very ex-
tensive, and affords plenty of fuel, which is, however, ob-
tained with considerable trouble and expence.  The soil,
which is various, produces moderate crops of beans, pease,
oats, barley, clover, and turnip.  The two last are much
more cultivated than formerly.  Potatoes are raised in great
abundance, and are the chief subsistence of the poorer sort
of inhabitants for six or eight months in the year.
   The climate is reckoned wholesome.  The people, in ge-
neral, are sober and industrious.  Many have been long-
lived; and, within these few years, one man died at the age
of 92, and a man and a woman aged 96.

   Trades.-Most of the adults are employed in agriculture,
excepting a few weavers, taylors, shoemakers, blacksmiths,
