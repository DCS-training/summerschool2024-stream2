above 150 different marks; and, being the property of the
inhabitants in general, were left to range at random over
the island.  They were never housed nor one of them taken
without a dog.  They separated themselves into different
flocks, and had their particular places of resort, the same
flock always frequenting the same place.  Every owner knew
the marks and haunts, not only of his own sheep, but also, in
general, those of all his neighbours; so that if any of them

sharp eye on the object of his pursuit, directs every motion
of his dog by a different call, by the course he himself takes,
or even by the waving of his hand; all which being readily
understood and obeyed by a well trained dog, the victim is
soon seized, and, for most part, without receiving any ma-
