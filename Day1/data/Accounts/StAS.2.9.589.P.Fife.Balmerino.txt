  The produce of the salmon-fishings, which used to be immense, has
not for some years past paid rent and wages, exclusive of material.
  Cattle are sold off fat, rising three years old, and bring from L. 10
to L. 15 a-head. Turnips and hay are consumed by the stock,

parish 14 thrasbing-machines, three of which are driven by water
power, 47 ploughs, and 98 horses for agricultural purposes.
  Husbandry.-The method of cropping varies according to the

is, potatoes, wheat, barley, grass (to lie two years) and oats : and
on the lightest, green crop (turnip eaten off with sheep), barley,
grass (to lie two or three years) and oats. The farmers gene-
