   The population, in the country part of the parish, has con-
siderably diminished, owing to the monopolizing of farms, or
conjoining a number of possessions into one; but it has in-
creased in proportion in the village of Damelingtoun, which
contains about 500 inhabitants.  Seven fairs are held in it e-
very year; and it has 5 or 6 public houses, kept by people of
good character.  Near the village are two large commons, let
at a reasonable rate to the inhabitants, for feeding their
cattle upon.  Each common may feed 25 or 30 cows.  There
is plenty of coal, freestone, and good water, all around; so
that, upon all these accounts, Damelingtoun is particularly well
situated for a woolen manufactory, especially as it is in the
neighbourhood of numerous and fine flocks of sheep.  Ac-
cordingly, a few public spirited men propose immediately to
establish both a woolen and a cotton manufactory here: which
in time, will probably be productive of the happiest effects;
as the inhabitants of the village are a sober, industrious, re-
gular, and well-informed set.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The stipend is 1200 merks
Sc. all in money; with a glebe of 11 acres.-The school-
master's salary is L. 100 Sc.-The average number of
poor is 27, maintained by weekly collections, and the interest
of a capital stock of L. 110.  The monopolizing of farms,
and the cheapness of houses and coal in the village, has con-
tributed much to increase the number of the poor; but they
are very diligent and industrious.-In the parish are the re-
mains of 3 old castles, one of them on an island in Loch
