     Statistical Account

The fishing begins on the 11 th of December, and is given up
on the 26 th of August.
   The spring and part of the summer fish go fresh, packed in
ice, to the London market; and when plentiful in warm wea-
ther, they are pickled for the same market.  No town in Scot-
land is better appointed for intercourse with London than
Perth, as every 4 days, at least during the fishing season, I
smack sails, and in general, makes the passage up within the
week, if the weather be any way favourable; and the passage
to London has often been performed within 60 hours; the
vessels return with porter, cheese, groceries, and other goods,
for the consumpt of the town, and supply of an extensive
rising country.  There are 7 vessels constantly employed in
the trade.

   Mills.-The mills belonging to the community or burrough
of Perth, are rented by Ramsay, Whittel and Co. at about
L. 800 sterling per annum.
   The leading article they manufacture is wheat into flour;
about two thirds of which may be supposed on their own ac-
count, for the supply of the town and neighbourhood; be-
sides, quantities are oceasionally shipped to the different
towns of Scotland.  The other third may be stated as manu-
factured at these mills by the bakers in town, for which they
pay multure to the company at a fixed rate, agreeable to the
old charter of the burrough.  The quantity ground may be
estimated upon an average, at 60 bolls per day.  They also
grind at these town mills, malt, bears oats, and pease; and
manufacture barley to a considerable amount.  But the article
of malt is greatly diminished since the late Act of Parliament,
which prohibited the working of the small stills in this district,
the line being fixed to the northward of Perth.
