have been built as a place of safety for the cattle and other pro-
perty of the inhabitants, to which they were sent when any danger
was at hand.
   Modern Buildings.--Kilmartin House, the residence of Neill
Malcolm, Esq., of Poltalloch, the principal heritor in the parish,
is about half a mile to the north-west of Kilmartin.
   The church of Kilmartin was erected in 1835. It is an ele-
gant Gothic building, of an oblong form, having a square tower
at the end, with front and side galleries supported by hewn stone
pillars, and surmounted with Gothic arches to correspond. The
internal arrangements are very complete, and afford comfortable
accommodation.
   The manse, which is contiguous to the church, was built in
1789. It is now in a very decayed state.
   The village of Kilmartin has been entirely rebuilt and re-
modelled within the last few years. Instead of the rude and ill-
assorted thatched cottages, all of which are now removed, the
proprietor has put down substantial slated cottages, having garden
and shrubbery ground enclosed and railed in for each, the whole
having an air of neatness and comfort formerly unknown in this
part of the country.
   A considerable number of similar slated cottages, and some
commodious farm steadings, have been recently built in other
parts of the parish, for the accommodation of the tenants, trades-
people, and labourers on the Poltalloch estate.
