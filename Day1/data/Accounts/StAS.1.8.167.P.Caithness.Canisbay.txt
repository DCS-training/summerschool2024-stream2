expected from a light-house on the Head.  It promises, in-
deed, many advantages as a station for a light-house; and the
principal objections which can be argued against it, are, the
great difficulty there would be, to find a person willing to ac-
cept of so tempestuous a residence in the winter months; and
the expence, which would be at least 6 times greater than at
the Head.  These points being considered, perhaps, it is up-
on the Head where the experiment ought first to be tried.
A light-boule on either of these stations, would be an infallible
safeguard to vessels from mistaking the bays of Reiss and of
Freswick in the night, for the Pentland Frith.  This has been
often done, and the most fatal consequences have ensued.
All mariners declare, that they would have no more hesi-
tation in sailing through the Pentland Frith, at the dead of
night, than at mid-day, had they the guidance of a light-
house to direct their course.  The number of vessels, that pass
and repass in the Pentland Frith, during the course of a year,
may be reckoned about 2000, or even upwards.

   Account of JOHN O'GROAT'S HOUSE.-We shall conclude
this paper, with an account of the most memorable place in the
parish, which has often been visited, by travellers from very
distant countries, who, it is believed, have rarely been made
acquainted with the peculiar circumstance, which first gave
rise to its celebrity; its fame having been in general errone-
ously attributed, to its more local situation, at the northern
extremity of the island; whereas, it originated in an event
not unpleasing to relate, and which furnishes a useful lesson
of morality.
   In the reign of James IV. of Scotland, Malcolm, Ga-
vin and John de Groat, (supposed to have been bro-
thers, and originally from Holland,) arrived in Caithness,
from the south of Scotland, bringing with them, a letter
written in Latin, by that prince, recommending them to the
