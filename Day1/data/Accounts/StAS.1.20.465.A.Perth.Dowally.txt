ternoon of every second Sabbath. On the forenoon of these
days he preaches at Dunkeld, and afterwards rides to Dow-
ally, a distance of 5 miles, to perform divine service there.
This parish has a session, a session-clerk, and register, sepa-
rate from those of Dunkeld, and the poor's funds are kept
distinct from those of the other.

   Church.-It is a long, narrow, inelegant structure, and
very incommodiously seated.  It was built by Bishop Brown
in the year 1500.  "Upon information that the Irish was
"spoken in the Highland parts of the parish of Caputh, the
"Bishop build and endowed a church in honour of the bless-
"ed Mother, St Anne*, among the woods of the Church-
"lands of Dowally +." In 1755 it had become ruinous,
and was then repaired and new-seated at the expense of the
tenants.

   School.-There is no salary allotted for a parish school-
master here, by consequence there is no parish school.  For
many years the Society for Propagating Christian Know-
ledge fixed one of their schools here, and the good effects of
it were conspicuous; but lately they have withdrawn it,
and at present the only school in the parish is taught by one
of the inhabitants, who is at the same time a farmer.  The
parishioners lately built a commodious school-house for him,
and the Duke of Atholl, by giving him his little farm on
casy terms, affords him such encouragement, as with the
school-fees, induces him to undergo the labour of teaching.
