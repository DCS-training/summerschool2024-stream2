lands now hold of the crown, as having come in the place of
that abbacy; and the first minister of Culross, at present, re-

boots, they were found to contain earth which he had brought
with him from Culross.  He was buried on the spot, and the
place still retains the name of the Monk's Grave, and is
ranked among the antiquities of the parishes.

distinction.  The proprietor of Tulliebole had this jurisdic-
tion.  During the last century, a quarrel took place between
two of his vassals, at a market in the Crook of Dovan.  In
