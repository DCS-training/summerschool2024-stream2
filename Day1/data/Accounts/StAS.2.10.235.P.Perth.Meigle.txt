  Buildings.- The body of the church was built about fifty-four
years ago; but two aisles of the old one remain.  It is a plain building
of stone.  Belmont House, the seat of Lord Wharneliffe, (called
Kirkhill till about seventy years ago, when it was rebuilt,) is a hand-
some quadrangular building, retaining part of the ancient tower,
in the back court.  The lawn is extensive and finely wooded, and
well kept, as is the garden.
  Meigle House, Drumkilbo, and Kinloch, are good mansions,
and pleasantly situated.  Potento, a moderate sized house, occupied
by a tenant, is delightfully situated on the south bank of the Dean;
surrounded with wood, and near the rocky banks of the river.
 On the opposite side of the Dean, is Caerdean, where there are
still the yestiges of a camp.

                 III.- POPULATION.
  There is no authentic record of the population till Dr Playfair

in the village of Meigle; 45 in Longlees; and in the country 530.
