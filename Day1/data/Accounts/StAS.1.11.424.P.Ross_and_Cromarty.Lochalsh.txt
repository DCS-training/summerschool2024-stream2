   The sheep and goats are kept solely for family use.  By
the produce of the black cattle, the farmer lives and pays his
rent to the landlord.  About 400 are annually sold to drovers
from the south of Scotland, who come to purchase them, from
April to November.  The average price will be about three
guineas.

   Commerce and Cultivation.-A considerable quantity of but-
ter and cheese is annually exported.  The butter is esteemed
of the best quality and highest flavour.  Formerly, the farmer
trusted for winter provender solely to pasture grass, on which
no cattle were pastured from the 12th of August to the 12th of
November.  Having little straw, and no hay, many cattle,
in severe winters, perished for want.  They now begin to in-
close their ground, and grow natural and artificial hay, by
which means this loss is in a great measure obviated.  By
raising more hay, and keeping a lighter stock, cattle of greater
value, secure from bad seasons, might he reared.  A very ex-
tensive bank of coral and shell sand, to which all the tenants
the estate have free access, will greatly contribute to pro-
mote agriculture amongst them.  Of late years it has been
generally used; and experience so much convinces them of its
utility, that it is now carried in small boats, bearing from 12
to 18 barrels, through Lochduich, 15 miles, and sometimes to
a considerable distance afterwards by land carriage.  Those
who carry it by contract, demand 6 d. per barrel for delivering
it on the shore.  By employing large flat-bottomed boats, the
pair of carriage might be much reduced and the manure,
