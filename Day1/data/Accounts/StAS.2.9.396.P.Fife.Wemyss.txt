all the recent improvements in mining machinery have been here
very successfully and advantageously introduced and applied, and
are all under the very active and efficient management and direc-
tion of Mr David Landale, mining engineer.
  Fisheries.-This branch of industry deserves notice. The fish-
ing station at Buckhaven is well knwn, and of late years has
greatly increased. There are 170 men employed in this trade,
and all belong to, and reside in Buckhaven. They have no fewer
than 144 fishing boats of various dimensions. Generally about
the beginning of July, they set out to the north, to Helmsdale,
Fraserburgh, and Wick, the great herring-fishing stations, where
they stay for about two months. It may well be said, that they
are a most industrious and hard-workidg class of men, and are
truly entitled, not only to protection, but to every countenance and
encouragement.

   It will be seen by the above statement, that the value of the
nets belonging to the second class of boats is greater than that of
the first class, because three sets of boats are necessary to the se-
cond class, while only two are required for the first and third.

of the yearly raw produce of this parish.

<FOOTNOTE>
     About twenty years ago, the Frith of Forth herring fishing was very extensive,
and paid well; but of late years, it has fallen much off, and for two or three years
back, it has been  a total failure.
