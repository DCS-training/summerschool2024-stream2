the best calculations that it is possible to make, on such data s could be
procured, that the following is pretty near the truth.

1. In-field, or land in complete cultivation, and al-         
   ways under crops of gram, green crops, or artifi-
   cial grass,                                               90,000   112,500           
2. Out-field, or land only occasionally tilled, and then   
   left ley; land of this description in tillage, sup-
   pose 100,000 acres, ely 100,000 also.  Total,            200,000   250,000
3. Pasture land never tilled, but capable of improve-
   ment,                                                     74,000    92,000
4. Waste lands, commonly called moot and moss,              153,000   191,300
5. Natural woods, and forests,                               30,000    37,500
6. Plantations,                                              28,000    35,000

   From this general view of the manner in which the lands in Aberdeen-
shire is employed, it will appear, what immense scope there is for improve-
ment.  Perhaps, of the whole, the land that is planted, or under natural
wood, together with, perhaps, one half of the in-field land, amounting
to about 100,000 Scotch acres, or 120,000 English, is all that has
nearly reached its proper value or height of produce.  When the land is
thoroughly cultivated, in the manner which is hoped will take place,
what additional wealth, of the best and most permanent nature, may not be
expected?

     III>  Live Stock

   The information respecting this important particular is more minute than
could have well been expected.  There are returns from 40 parishes in the
county, of the number of horses, cattle, and sheep in each.  Of these, there
are four parishes, namely, Birse, Grathre, Glenmurck, and Strathdon, which
are particulary circumstanced, having more than the used proportion of live-
stock; at is proposed therefore, in the following account, to keep them di-
stinct, and afterwards to state the stock in the 36 other parishes which have
sent returns; and then to estimate the parishes whence there are no return,
in the same proportion with those returned, according to their respective
valuations.  The live-stock of the county of Aberdeen, on these principles,
may be then stated in the following manner:
