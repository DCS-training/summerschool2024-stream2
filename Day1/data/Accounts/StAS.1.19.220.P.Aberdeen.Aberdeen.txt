and heath, kept down with stones, in an oblique direction, on
the south side of the river, a good way into the channel.
This seems already to have good effects, by turning the
stream to the north, and deepening the river's mouth.  It is
daily gaining additional strength, because the weather is
driving the sand close behind, and thereby supporting it.
   The salmon in Dee and Don are thought to be in the
highest perfection in April and May.  For several years
past they have not been sold here at any time under 3 d.
per pound; and until the beginning of July, when the an-
nual contract of the proprietors of the fishings with the
Aberdeen merchants, who send the salmon to the London
market, expires, none are to be had under 6 d. per pound.
To obtain them even at this price we must send to the
boil-houfs in Aberdeen.  It is hard, that while our rivers
abound in fish, their whole produce should, for five or six
months in the year, be sold to one or two Aberdeen mer-
chants, at about 4 d. or even under that sum, and that, du-
ring that period, none of the inhabitants can obtain a single
pound under 6 d. and that only in the way of favour from
the merchants.  Last year our salmon were selling in the
London market cheaper than we could buy them at Aber-
deen.  Was not this carrying on a monopoly at once to
the disadvantage of the merchants and the country?  It has
been alleged, that the proprietors of the Bishop's Cavel
were once obliged to offer their fish for sale in the market
of Old Aberdeen.  If ever this commendable practice took
place, it has long ago fallen into disuse.  Two thirds of the
produce go to the London market; and the catch of July,
August, and September, is salted, and exported in barrels to
France and Flanders, where they have a character superior
to the fish of other rivers, which occasions a difference of
price at home of 10 s. to 15 s. per barrel.  From 120 to 150
