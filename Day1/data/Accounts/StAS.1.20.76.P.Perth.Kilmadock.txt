market was therefore filled with bad meal, lost in the dry-
ing, from the insufficiency of these rickles of buildings to
perform the work.  Besides, there were many melancholy
accidents from fire.  These, and some other causes, have
now made way for the introduction of brick kilns, which
have become general.
   It would be a capital improvement to erect a kiln at eve-
ry corn-mill, to be attended by an experienced dryster, hi-
red by the thirled farmers.  The kiln might be so placed that
the grain could be conveyed from the kiln-head to the mill-
happer, by having both on a level, and a lost from the kiln-
head to the happer.  Observe the profit of such a plan.  In
the common way, the corn has to be put into sacks, loaded,
and carried to the mill; there unloaded, and carried up a
stair, by strength of arm and back alone.  All this labour
would be saved by the plan above mentioned, besides ha-
ving the corn immediately grinded when ready.
   Major Main of Powis Logie, an ingenious gentleman, and
one of the most eminent improvers of the country, has fa-
voured me with a description of a drying-kiln of his own
invention, erected at Powis, which is given in the appen-
dix.

   Mills, and Sale of Grain.-The Deanston cotton-mills
will be mentioned under a separate title.
   There are seven mills in the parish for the manufacturing
of grain, viz. Doune, Cambus, Candy, Lanerick, Cessintul-
ly, Auchleshie, and Argaty, and there is an old corn-mill
at Callichat, which has not been used for some time.
   There is no object requires greater attention than the
establishment of proper corn-mills, because here all the la-
bour of the year centers.  Yet no branch of police is more
neglected than proper rules between millers and farmers.
