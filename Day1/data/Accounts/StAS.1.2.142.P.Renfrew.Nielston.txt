four more stones of considerable thickness, four feet and a
half high, and placed four feet distant from each other, which
many have supposed, with great probability, to have been the
monument of Niel.  These stones were entirely demolished a-
bout 30 years ago.

   Situation, Extent, and Surface.-This parish is situated in
the shire of Rensrew, presbytery of Paisley, and provincial
synod of Glasgow and Ayr.  Its extent is very considerable.
There was a map made of it many years ago, which, was
lately inquired after, but without success.  The form of the
parish is irregular, reaching about nine miles in length, from
east to west, and may be, on an average, three miles in
breadth.  Supposing the above extent were perfectly accurate.
and allowing 503 Scots acres in an English square mile, it
contains, 13,570 acres.-In the lower parts of the parish,
which is at the east end, the soil is various, and all kinds of
grain common to Scotland are cultivated to advantage.  But
to the west, the country gradually rises, till it comes to a 
pretty high elevation.  It is mostly of a light mould, and
though much of it be tilled, yet it appears better calculated
for pasturage.-The Faraneze and Lochlibo-side hills,
making one ridge, reaching from north-west to south-west for
several miles, are covered with green, and contain a number 
of arable farms; and, as the farm-houses appear in a line
along the steep ascent*, they afford a beautiful prospect to

<FOOTNOTE>

*The declivity in some of these farms is so considerable, that
it has been a question, whether they ought to be plowed.  In
some parts they get only one surrow taken, and slide back the
plow to the part where they began, before they can take another.
The soil also must be washed down the hill.
