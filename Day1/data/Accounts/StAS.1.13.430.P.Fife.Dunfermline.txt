town stands on a plain.  The town is mose pleasantly situa-
ted, and the prospect it commands remarkably various,
beautiful, and extensive.  There is an excellent view of 
Edinburgh, the Castle, Arthur-seat, and the elevated 
grounds in the vicinity of the metropolis; in clear weather

of Culross, and the beautiful windings of the Forth from
