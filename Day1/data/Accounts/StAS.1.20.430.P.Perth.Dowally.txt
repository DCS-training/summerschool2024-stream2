   3 .Mason Lodges.-Of these there are two in Dunkeld.
One is No XVI. in the roll of the Grand Lodge of Scot-
land, and the other No CCII.  Though these were not in_
stituted for the immediate purposes of charity, yet a great
portion of their funds are applied to them.  Indeed, the lat-
ter have ingrafted a box on their Masonic funds, from which
they allow 3 s. weekly to a member in distress, L. 2 for his
burial, and L. 1 for the burial of his wife.

     TRADE AND MANUFACTURES.

   1. Yarn.-This is the staple commodity of the country
above Dunkeld, and the merchants here deal in it exten-
sively.  Not less than 200,000 spindles are bought annual-

*Some improvements on the construction of the spinning-wheel, have
been lately invented by a wheelwright in Dunkeld.  At the desire of the
late Duchess of Atholl, (whoa was disposed to patronise the inventor), a
comparative trial was mad betwixt the quantity and quality of the yarn
which could be spun on this improved wheel, and one of the old form.  The
result was, that with greater ease to the spinner, nearly one-third more, and
of better quality, was spun on the former.  The Trustees for Manufactures
would find here a proper object for their encouragement.
