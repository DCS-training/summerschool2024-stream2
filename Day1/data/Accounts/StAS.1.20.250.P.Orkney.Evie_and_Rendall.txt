cumbent, a stranger in Orkney, and much prejudiced 
against this machine, affirms, that after repeated careful
trials, he could discover no difference betwixt the crops rai-
sed after this plough, and the crops raised after a very good 
two-stilted one.  The returns of bear are from five to six 
seeds; of the oats three, or three and a half, seldom or ever 
four.  The only improvement attempted in these parishes 
is rearing potatoes.  In 1769, there were none raised in 
either parish, except a few in Rendall, in lazy-beds; and as
late as 1784 there were none raised in Evie.  They are 
now universally cultivated with success, in sufficient quan-
tities for the inhabitants, but very few for sale, there being 
no market for them.  The only other vegetable raised is 
cabbage, which thrives exceeding well; and the mini-
ster's garden shews, that all the other vegetables raised in 
the north of Scotland, would thrive equally well in these 
parishes.  The ground in cultivation amounts to about 1200
planks, of 40 fathoms, or 80 yards square, each; all the 
other ground consists of meadow, (from which some hay is 
made), and some very good natural grass and pasture.  By 
far the greater part of the rents are payable in kind, that is,
in bear or malt, oat-meal, tallow, butter, poultry, peats,
and but a trifle in money.  The whole amounting, at the 
ordinary conversion, to about L. 800 Sterling.

   Size of Farms, Horses, Cattle, etc.-The farms are gene-
rally very small, consisting of from 6 to 10 or 12 planks of 
arable land, besides grass and pasture.  There are indeed 
three or four tenants who rent tolerable farms; but of these 
they subset a considerable part.  There are besides these 
a good number of cottagers, who have a small patch of corn
land, with two or three black-cattle, and perhaps a small 
Shetland horse.  The number of horses in these parishes is 
fully 500, worth from L. 4 to L. 10 Sterling,  This is per-
