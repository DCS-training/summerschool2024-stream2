   Antiquities.-Under the head of antiquities, there is little
that deserves notice, but a prodigiously large cairn of stones,
in a moor on the N. side of the post or county road, where
tradition says a battle was fought; but no circumstances are
handed down concerning it.  Some Lochaber and Danish-
axes, of a particular figure, have been dug out of the moss of
Earnside, in the neighbourhood of this cairn.  An inscrip-
tion on a grave-stone in the church-yard, dated in the year
1590, records a very uncommon circumstance.  It runs thus:
"Here lies ANDERSON of Pittensere, maire of the earldom of
"Moray, with his wife MARJORY, whilk him never displicit."

   Character of the People.-The people, in general, are very
sober and industrious, regular in their attendance upon public
worship, and fully equal to their neighbours in point of
knowledge and information.  They have lately acquired a
taste for greater neatness in their houses, furniture and dress,
than formerly prevailed.
