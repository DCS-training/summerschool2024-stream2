up, sometimes in the form of a molehill, about each stalk,
which is a great improvement.  In this way of manage-
ment the ground is well cleaned, and afterwards yields a
good crop of wheat or oats.  The potatoes are planted on
light dry land, either naturally rich, or made so with dung.
Lime is found hurtful, by making them grow scabbed.  In
order to prevent their degeneracy, the feed is carefully
picked, and such as grow curled leaves are kept out if pos-
sible.  Though a rotation of crops is generally observed
here, by raining one green and two white, yet some of the
farmers, distinguished for skill in and attention to business,
are often directed by the seasons, and the various soil of
their lands.
   Hence the number of acres occupied by distinct species
of crops can hardly be ascertained.  It is supposed that one
half of the whole parish is generally in pasture; the other
half in tillage; and one-third of that laid down annually
with grass-feeds, the ground being always first properly
cleaned and prepared for them.  The parish rears a great
deal more grain of all kinds than the inhabitants use, and
the cattle bred or fattened within its bounds are not half,
scarcely the third part, consumed there.  Upwards of 50
ploughs are employed in the parish, and drawn generally
with two horses.  Oxen are also used, and found to answer
the purposes of husbandry, both in the cart and plough.

   Population.-Vestiges of villages, malt steeps, cottages,
and other memorials of inhabitation in various parts of the
parish, indicate the population to have been formerly very
considerable; but no exact lift of old date having fallen into
my hands, the number cannot be ascertained far back.
Agreeably to a practice recommended and generally ob-
