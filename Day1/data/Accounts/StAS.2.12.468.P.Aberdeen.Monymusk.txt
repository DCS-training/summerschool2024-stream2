lation of 131 souls, is a place of some antiquity, as Buchan-
an, in his history of the reign of Malcolm Canmore, meiitions,
that that king lay encamped, ad " Monimuscum vicum," at the
village of Monymusk, in his way north to quell an insurrection in
Moray.  It has been almost entirely rebuilt of late by the pro-
prietor, and forms a very neat square, with some fine old trees
growing in the centre.  It enjoys the conveniency of a daily post,
and has at present three weekly carriers to Aberdeen, with which
it has easy communication by two turnpike roads, one of which
passes through the parish for four miles and a-half, and joins the
great north road nearly a mile below Kintore, and the other leads
through the parishes of Midmar, Echt, and Skene, in a more
southerly direction, to which there is access at about three miles
distance from the village, by a good commutation road passing
through the parish of Cluny, the whole distance of either of the
roads being pretty much the same.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church stands on the east side
of the village, the entrance to the churchyard being from the
centre of one of the sides of the square, and is conveniently enough
situated for the greater part of the population.  Its distance is
somewhat more than two miles from the eastern, and from four to
five from the western, extremity of the parish ; but the upper part
of the parish, which lies among the hills, being but thinly inhabit-
ed, there are only four families above three miles distant from the
church.  The date of its erection is not certainly known, but it is
supposed to have been built in the eleventh century, when the
priory was founded here by Malcolm Canmore, who, having en-
camped at the village of Monymusk, as already mentioned, vow-
ed, as Buchanan relates, that, if he returned victorious from his
expedition to the north, he would devote the village where he lay.
encamped to St Andrew, the tutelary saint of Scotland.  Having
arrived at the Spey, and being about to enter that river, he was
stopped by the priests, dressed in their canonicals, who, with his
permissions passed over to the enemy, and finished the war with-
out any effusion of blood.  In fulfilment of his vow he, according-
ly, founded, endowed, and dedicated the Priory of Monymusk, as
appears from an old writing in Latin in Monymusk House, bear-
ing to have been extracted from the register of St Andrews and
which, after describing the boundaries of the lands assigned to it,
which were ample, concludes to this effect: " And thus these are
the marches which King Malcolm bequeathed, on account of a vic-
