plough, and planted with advantage.
   The crops raised generally are oats and barley.  The green
crops are turnips and potatoes.  The duration of leases is nine-
teen years, which is too short a period when expensive im-
provements are undertaken.  The most common complaint, how-
ever, among the farmers, is the low price of grain, vhich ren-
ders it very difficult to meet the term of payment of rents, ser-
vants' wages, tradesmen's bills, &c. without encroaching on their
capital.
   Produce.-The average gross amount of raw produce raised in
the parish, as far as can be ascertained, is as follows:-
