and, trifling as this quantity may appear, it has a consider-
able influence on the condition of the people.

   Population.-The number of our people, in 1755, was only
642, and amounts now to 730, consequently there is an in-
crease of 88.  The cause of this increased population, we
are able to trace to the residence of a single proprietor.  A-
mong the people in a country parish, whose farms are small
and whose tacks are only verbal, the residence of heritors, if
they be men of sense and virtue, is of the greatest advantage.
They silence disputes, and terminate any differences that may
arise, by their authority; they set an example of industry,
and by their smiles or their frowns, not only distinguish the
deserving from the worthless, but reward the one, while they
punish the other.  Beyond all dispute, whatever promotes indus-

Besides these means, the proprietor alluded to has made use
of others still more effectual.  Finding, on his entry, a pau-

soon erected between 20 and 30 new houses, which are filled
with young people that have married, and with families
from other islands.  These have almost all of them nume-
rous families of children; and, what is a clear evidence of
their vast increase is, that about 17 years ago the youngest
child in the small district of Sound, was 13 years of age, and
the same district contains now, at and below that age, about
70 children.  As there has been no register of deaths kept
here, we cannot compare the births and deaths together, in
order to ascertain the extent of the increase; nor have the
registers of the marriages and baptisms, on account of the
last minister's infirm state of health for some time before his
death been brought down to the present period.  From the
