returns which have frequently been obtained from these, it
is reasonable to think that much of the land is well adapted
to the growth of that plant.  The culture of turnip, for
which much of the soil is also well adapted, has not yet been
attempted to any considerable extent, nor with that assiduity
necessary to make it advantageous.  Every husbandman
plants potatoes, to the extent, perhaps, of half an acre to a
ploughgate, at an average; and this root succeeds extremely
well in most places, when sufficient pains is bestowed on the
culture.  There are no considerable orchards in this parish;
but towards the foot of the Nethan, and all along the Clyde
below the falls, apple, pear, and plum trees are planted in
every little garden; and in those narrow warm vallies, shel-
tered by the high land on all sides, these trees, particularly
the plum trees, generally produce a considerable quantity of
good fruit.
   Besides annual productions a considerable quantity of wood
grows in the parish, much of the hanging ground by the
sides of the different rivers being clothed with coppices.
Some of these are very extensive, particularly Stonebyres
woods, which are arranged into such a number of lots, that
one of them is always ready to cut annually, for the sale of
such small timber as is commonly used in the country.  Only
the banks of the Logan and the Kype are naked, they having
their courses through high moorish ground, the bottom of
which is whin rock, for the most part adverse to the growth
of timber.  The juniper tree, a plant not to be found in the
neighbouring country, abounds on the sides of the hills in
the eastern part of this parish.
