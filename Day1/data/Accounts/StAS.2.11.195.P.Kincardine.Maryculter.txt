the Infirmary in Abdrdeen, and a Lunatic Hospital fund, amount-
ed last year to L.40, 7s. 6 1/2d. a great deal for a small and rather
poor parish. The poor's funds, from which interests (at different

Gordon of Heathcote, formerly of Premnay.
	Inns.--There is only one inn or alehouse in the parish.
	Fuel.--The common fuel was peat, though coals are now found
to be cheaper, and are great y used by all who have not horses
and carts of their own. As Aberdeen is not distant, they can be
driven thence without much expense.
