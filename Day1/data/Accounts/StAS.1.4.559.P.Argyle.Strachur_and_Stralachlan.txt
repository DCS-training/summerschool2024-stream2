-In Autumn 1780, a remarkable water-spont fell on part
of this parish, particularly on the hills to the north east of
Locheck.  It rushed down the hills with such force, as to
tear up the surface of the ground, tumbling down large
stone, trees, moss, and land, which were mostly left in the
plains that border the lake.  Eight or ten acres of very
good arable land were entirely destroyed.  The quantity
of stones and rubbish was so great, that twice the value of
the land would not be sufficient to defray the expense of 
clearing it.  Eight inhabited houses were totally thrown
down, part carried into the lake, part buried under the sand,
&c.  Fortunately this happened about 2 o'clock in the af-

were in imminent danger.  Had this happened in the night-
time, many lives must have been lost.  The parish contri-

ferers.  Every man who could work, assisted with eager-
ness in rebuilding the houses.  The landlord behaved with
the greatest humanity to the tenants.  All the houses on a
small farm to the north-west of Locheck, were demolished
by a similar flood, some years before.

   Curious Stones, etc.-On a high part of that ridge of hills
which separates Stralachlan from Glendaruel, there is a very
large stone, remarkable for its situation.  There is a descent
from it on every side.  The prospect from it is very extensive.
It is called Cuilleach-vear of vera.  In the dark ages of su-
perslition, it was personified, and said to have a considerable
property in cattle.  Cailleuch-vear makes a conspicuous fi-
gure in the marvellous tales of the country people, over a
