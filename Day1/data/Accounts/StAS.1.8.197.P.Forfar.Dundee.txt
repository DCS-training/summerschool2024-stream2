and the Burn of Murroes, consists of a soil good and dry,
though rather thin, and the south bank of Duntroon is also
fertile.  The worst land lies to the north of the hills of Bal-
gay, Duntroon, and the Law.  But the neighbourhood of
this large town seems to place all there varieties of soil upon
a level.  They are, in general, in a state of high cultivation,
and produce valuable crops.  Instead of large pieces of moor,
which, within the last 30 years, were to be found every
where, there is hardly to be seen a single spot.  All is culture
or plantation, except a few acres of common, and very little
lies waste through neglect.

   Cultivation.-The number of people, who have farms, is
31 or 32.  But of farmers, properly so called, and who make
farming their only business, there are not more than 15.  The
practice of one of the most industrious and intelligent, is as
follows.  He rents 130 acres at 40 s. per acre:  he keeps
constantly 7 servants, and 8 horses; he employs in spring
3 ploughs, each wrought by 2 horses, and in winter, 2
ploughs wrought by 4; and he uses 4 carts, whole dimen-
sions are 8 feet by 4.  His land is laid out in 7 divisions cul-
tivated in this rotation:  1. fallow, 2 wheat, 3. potatoes and
turnips horse-hoed, 4. barley, 5. oats, with grass seeds, 6. grass,
chiefly sold green, and cut and carried off by the buyers, 7.
grass cut for hay.  In this rotation, the whole manure is
given to the wheat, and the system seems to be approved of
by his neighbours, and generally adopted.  He begins to sow
wheat in September, oats in March, barley in April, turnips
from the 10th to the midale of June; and his crops of grain
are generally reaped in September.  The reaping is wholly
performed by the sickle, and all the kinds of gram are bound
in sheaves, and, while on the field, set up in shocks.  An acre
of good turnips sells from 7 L. to 10 L., according to the distance
