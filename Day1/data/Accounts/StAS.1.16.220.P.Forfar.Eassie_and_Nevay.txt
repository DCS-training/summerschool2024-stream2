     Statistical Account

Meigle it is almost impassable during winter.  There is no
direct road from either parish to Dundee; but one from
Glammis, and another from Newtyle, to that sea-port,
were lately completed; and the distance between one or
other of these places and the most remote point in the di-
strict does not exceed four miles.

   Church, etc.-There is a small church in each parish,
where divine service is performed alternately.  The church
of Essie is situated on an eminence, 2 miles west of Glam-
mis, and 5 from Meigle; that of Nevay stands on a rising
ground, formerly surrounded by marsh 2 1/2 miles S. W.
of Essie.  Both are mean fabrics.  The date of the union
of these parishes was prior to the middle of last century.
The manse, near the church of Essie, has a commanding
prospect to the west and north-west.  It is well built, and
the offices are in good condition.
   By an old decreet of locality, the stipend was ascertained
to be L. 433: 6: 8 Scots money, and 4 chalders victual;
and the glebe consisted of 4 acres of land adjoining to the
manse, 1 1/2 acre at the church of Nevay, and an acre of
grass.  An augmentation having been granted not many
years ago, the living is now worth L. 90 a-year.  The
names of the ministers since the reformation are, Mr David
Brown, Mr Crichton, Mr Silvester Lamy, Mr Adam Da-
vidson, Mr -Alexander Finlayson, Mr Maxwell of Strath-
martine, and Mr Ogilvy, the incumbent.

   School, etc.-The parochial school and schoolmasler's
house are situated near the centre of the district, about 1 1/2
miles S. W. of Essie church, in a barren spot at the foot of
Sidla.  The salary, with other emoluments annexed to
that office, may amount to L. 12 Sterling.  The number
of scholars for some years past has been inconsiderable.
