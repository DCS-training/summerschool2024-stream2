seen in it.-The river Ayr in its course, especially through
Machlin parish, passes between steep rocks, from 30 to 40
feet high.  How this passage was formed, whether by art, or
by the water gradually making a channel for itself, is a point
which cannot now be ascertained.-The only loch in
the parish, called Lock-Brown, is about three miles norht-west
from Machlin.  Wild-ducks, geese, and sometimes swans re-
sort to it.  It covers about 60 acres of ground; and would
have been drained may years ago, had it not been for the sake
of two corn mills which it supplies with water.-There is 
no tradition of any battle in the parish, except one at Mach-
lin muir, between the kings party and the Covenanters, about
the year 1647, when the former was defeated; and their mi-
litary chest was found, it is said, many years after, hidden in
the ground.-The antient parochial records of the parish are
now lost.  Sometime before the Reformation, the Popith cler-
gy perceived their interest declining, and their down-fall ap-
proaching in the kingdom, to prepare for the world, they sold
their lands for ready money, in small parcels, and then depart-
ed, carrying with them all their money and effects, and all the
books and registers belonging to this, and, it is believed, to
other parishes in the neighbourhood.
