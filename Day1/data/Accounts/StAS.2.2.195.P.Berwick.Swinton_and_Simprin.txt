   Note.-The above estimate is by the boll of six imperial bushels for
all descriptions of grain. The prices are the average fiars prices of the
last ten years, proportioned to the imperial measure, the fiars of Ber-
wickshire having only been struck for the last four years by that
standard.
   As there is little hay raised for sale, the value is included in the
estimated produce of grass land.

   Means of Communication.-There are about eight miles of turn-
pike road in the parish, but not travelled by any public carriages;
and there are three bridges. The roads are excellent, and com-
pletely fenced, and the bridges, (one of which has been lately built,)
are in a good condition.
   Ecclesiastical State.-From the small extent of the parish, the
church, though placed rather too near to its north-east corner, is
quite convenient for the whole of the inhabitants. It was built in
1729,-an aisle was added to it by the feuars of the village, for their
own accommodation, in 1782,-and it is still in tolerable repair. It
is seated to accommodate 400 persons, and there are no free sit-
tings. It holds, however, considerably more than that number,
and from fifty to seventy persons are regularly supplied with seats
in the passage.
   The manse was built in 1771, and has been several times re-
paired. In 1815, when it was last repaired, a considerable addi-
tion also was made to it.
