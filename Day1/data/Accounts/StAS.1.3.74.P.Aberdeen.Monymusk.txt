   Improvements and Agriculture.-Agriculture, and, indeed,
improvements of almost every kind, were carried to a very
advanced state by the late Sir Archibald Grant.  As he
could find no persons in this country qualified to super-
intend his improvements, he was careful to draw to this
corner, by suitable rewards, men of knowledge in farming,
from such parts of the kingdom as had advanced farthest
in agriculture; and by employing such, either as oversees, or
by giving them advantageous leases with suitable accommo-
dations, a part of the estate was brought into good order, its
value increated, and the country people convinced, by the
striking example of advantage before their eyes, of the necess-
sity of draining, cleaning, straightening, and green-croping
their lands, to save much labour, and ensure better returns.
But, as long rooted prejudices cannot be universally eradi-
cated, it was judged necesary to bind down the tenants in
their leases, to a proper method of managing their fields,
to build annually a certain quantity of stone dykes, to lay on
a quantity of lime proportioned to the extent of their farms,
to cultivate a suitable proportion of turnips, potatoes, arti-
ficial graties, etc.  This scheme had the desired effect;
and the mode which many at first were obliged reluctantly
to adopt, is become so agreeable and profitable, that they
would renounce their leases, rather than relinquish a plan of
management, they now find to be so productive.
