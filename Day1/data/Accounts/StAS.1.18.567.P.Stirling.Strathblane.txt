and disappointment, and various methods have been adopted,
to remedy or supply the defect.  Some by preserving and
collecting the seed of such as remained the second year, ac-
quired by degrees, a stock sufficient for their own supply-
Others, by sowing an additional quantity of clover seed, se-
cured at least, a good bulk of hay the second year, though
inferior in quality to the rye-grass hay.
   But the hope of an effectual and general relief is now af-
forded, by the public spirited proposals of the Farmers Society
at Glasgow, who have lately taken the matter into considera-
tion.  This society (of which most of the farmers in this pa-
rish are members), consists of the most noted and experienced
farmers in an extent of country of 15 or 20 miles round Glas-
gow.  The exertions of so many men, eminent in their pro-
session, promise to become of general utility.  By a private
subscription among themselves, they have already raised a
considerable fund, from which, they give premiums to emi-
nence in agricultural exertions or useful improvements.
They also assist spirited members of their own body, by lend-
ing them money from their fund, toward carrying useful pro-
jects into execution.  It has been proposed amongst them, to
commission their own grass-seeds from the best foreign mar-
kets; by this plan if it shall be carried into execution, they
will not only secure the best in quality, but also have a
saving on the price.  When imported to the general depot at
Glasgow, each parish can conveniently get the quantity alot-
ted to it conveyed home.  It is by turning the attention of the
inhabitants of a country to such useful and practical objects,
that a nation may expect to become truly great.
   Pease and beans have been found to thrive well in several
farms, and one spirited farmer made lately an experiment of
a wheat crop, which succeeded to his wish.  From 2 acres,
he reaped 32 bolls.  The ground indeed was summer fallow-
