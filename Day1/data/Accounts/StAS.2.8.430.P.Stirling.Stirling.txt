der every part of the town, at a greater or smaller depth, is found
the greenstone, on which the superstratum of soil rests; and, in
many places where the foundations of houses are being dug out,
or improvements are being made on the streets, and lines of com-
munication from one part of the town to another, affords excellent
materials for building, causewaying, and road-making.
  Salmon Fishery.-The salmon fisheries belonging to the place
are carried on up and down the Forth, and even in the Teith;
and extend somewhat beyond the boundaries of the parish. There
is nothing peculiar in the manner in which they are kept up, or
in the mode of fishing practised, which is by boats and ordinary
drag-nets. The rents amounted for the year 1840, to L.766.
  Average amount of raw produce raised in the parish as nearly as
can be ascertained, viz:

  Manufactures and Trade.-A carefully prepared official report
was drawn up in 1832, for the information of Government, respect-
ing the town and suburbs of Stirling; from which the following
particulars relating to those two branches are extracted:-
  The following manufactures are carried on, amounting, as nearly
as can be estimated, for the year 1831, to the extent attached to
each of them per annum:

<FOOTNOTE>Of these there are seven in the parish; besides gardens without orchards attach-
ed to them; but, owing to the extreme precariousness of the crops, especially of fruit,
for some years, and changes in the occupation in some cases, it has been found im-
practicable to give any return.
