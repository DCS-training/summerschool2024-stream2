by the present existing laws regarding salt.  If this obstacle
were removed, by allowing the country people fait at the same
duty as the fish curers have it, for curing fish for home con-
sumption, their condition would be greatly improved.  They
would then not only have it in their power, to cure a suffi-
cient quantity for the use of their families, at a smaller ex-
pence, but likewise find profitable employment in curing her-
rings for the Irish markets.  It is now not at all uncom-
mon to see them, after catching a quantity of fish, in propor-
tion to their small stock of salt, return from a lake where
boat loads might be taken.  The country people, from the
same cause, not two years ago, sold good herrings in Loch-
duich to the masters of busses, at from 1 s. to 2 s. per bar-

ployed in attending cattle, are generally disposed to be idle,
and, though able-bodied, continue at hard work with re-
luctance.  The women particularly, ignorant of the arts of
domestic industry, contribute little to the support of their fa-
milies.  Habits of industry, however, begin to be acquired.
The introduction of some species of manufacture would great-
ly meliorate their condition, without interfering much with
their principal employment of herding.  The manufacture of
coarse stockings seems to be the best adapted for the local si-
tuation of the country.  There is a great quantity of wool
raised on sheep farms in the neighbourhood, which might be
spun during the winter, a season generally spent in idleness,
and knitted while they sit in the meadows tending their herds.
If the population continues to increase, in the same proportion
as it has done for the last 40 years, unless some employment be
found for the people, the country will soon be unable to sup-
port them, and they will be reluctantly compelled to seek, in
other countries, that encouragement and protection which
