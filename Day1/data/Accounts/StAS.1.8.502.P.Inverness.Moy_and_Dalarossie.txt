   Mode of Cultivation.-Farming is carried on almost in the
same method at present, that was in use for ages past; very
few improvements have been introduced, nor do the people
seem disposed to adopt any.  Instead of laying the whole dung
of the farm on the barley land, according to the general custom
in other places, it is all laid here on the ley land, which they
break up for oats; excepting a small part of it, which is re-
served for the little barley that is sown, and the potatoes.

   Ploughs, Cattle, etc.-On account of the shortness of the
labouring season, the number of ploughs in the parish, is much
greater then the quantity of land would otherwise require.
They are not fewer than 246, and chiefly drawn by 4 horses
each, and sometimes there are two oxen along with the horses.
The number of horses in this parish is about 900; the num-
ber of black cattle 1,800; and of sheep 12,000.  There is a
considerable number of each of these kinds of cattle sold an-
nually, with the price of which the tenants pay their rents,
and provide for themselves all the articles that their farms do
not furnish.-The sheep, upon the large sheep farms, are of
the black faced kind; but those, kept by the tenants, are a
cross breed, between the large black faced, and the small
sheep, formerly kept in the country.  The wool of the large
sheep is of a coarser quality, than that of the small; the wool
of the latter sells from 16 s to 18 s. per stone, Dutch weight.

   Wild Animals, Birds, etc.-Foxes are very numerous over all
this country, and very destructive to the sheep and poultry.  Of
late years, a fox-hunter has been hired by the neighbourhood
to destroy them.  The parish abounds in polecats, otters, and
badgers.  The red deer are very numerous about the source
of the Findhorn.  The woods in Moy abound with roes.
Black game and grouse are so plentiful in this parish, that
