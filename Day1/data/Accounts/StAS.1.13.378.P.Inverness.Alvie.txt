     Statistical Account

of the Spev, where horses can bring only back-loads; the
Southern division of the parish is plentifully and easily sup-
plied with peats and burnwood.

   Manufactures.-The natives are remarkable for the
quantity and quality of white plaiding they bring to mar-
ket, all manufacturing what wool their own exigencies
will permit in that manner.  Their blankets and clothing
have very few dyes, and are extremely coarse; their plaid-
ing sells at about 10 d. the ell (39 inches.)

   Morals, Etc.-It is very uncommon to have any recourse
to the Sheriff, much less to the Justiciary Court; any dif-
ference arising is settled by the Justices of the Peace for
the district.  Only one suicide has been heard of. They
are much addicted to drinking of whisky; whence, at their
public meetings (Such as burials, etc.) squabbles are fre-
quent; their fondness for spirits is owing to the easy access
to it, there being no less than 13 houses in the parish, where
drams are sold without a county or excise licence, to the
very great prejudice of the purse, constitution, and morals
of the natives.  Such a nuisance to society is overlooked
by the proper officer, on account of the trouble and distance
from the county town, the proprietors also residing at a di-
stance.

   Professions.-There is no surgeon, public writer, officer of
excise, messenger, mason, carpenter, baker, or butcher in
the parish, and no jail.  There is one Justice of Peace, 2
shopkeepers, 2 smiths, 6 weavers, 4 tailors, and 2 brog-
makers; these handicraftsmen are fit only for the coarfest
work.  If measures could be adopted for the encouragement
of proper tradesmen, it would benefit the country greatly.
