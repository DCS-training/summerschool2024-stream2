to 3000 barrels, finds a ready market and a good price
through the island, particularly in Kirkwall.
   As no measurement of this parish has ever been taken,
the proportion which the uncultivated lands bear to those
that are cultivated, cannot be ascertained with any degree of
exactness; but the latter, it is certain, have been divided in-

   Church, Minister, etc.-The church was built in 1630, and
dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and bears the name of Lady
Kirk.  The manse was erected in 1760.  The stipend, with
the profits of the glebe, may amount to about 90 l. Sterling;
and besides the present incumbent, who was settled 12 th
September last, there have only been two ministers of Sha-
pinshay, namely, Messrs Alexander Nisbet, and Alexander
Pitcairn, since the Revolution.  In the new erection and
foundation of the chapter, made by Bishop Reed, no men-
tion whatever is made of the minister of this parish, as a-
mong the seven dignitaries, or seven canons and prebends
that composed this chapter.  The minister of South Ro-
naldshay was provost or dean; the minister of Birsay arch-
deacon; the minister of Orphir precentor; the minister of
Sanda chancellor; the minister of Stronsay treasurer; the mi-
nister of Islay sub-dean; and the minister of Walls sub-
chantor.

   Antiquities.-The genius of superstition has been as active

rious parts of the parish.  What good purpose they could
serve, it is not very easy to imagine, especially when built, as
they sometimes were, on holms or uninhabited islands.  In
