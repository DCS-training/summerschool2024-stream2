Drum, and is now the property of Lord Aberdeen. *  It is said to
have been one of the last strongholds of James II.'s partisans, who,
after the battle of Killiecrankie, possessed themselves of Fyvie;
Castle, and, being obliged to abandon it, took refuge in Fedder-
ate, but were pursued and expelled from thence by King William's
troops.
   About a mile to the west of the village is an extensive piece of
moor called Bruce Hill.  This is said to have derived its name
from Edward, brother to Robert the Bruce.  Here he is reported
to have encamped after the battle of Inverury, and from this to
have gone in pursuit of the Cummins to a place near Old Deer,
called Aikey Brae.  In memory of this victory, the market of Aikey
fair is said to have been established on the spot where the battle
was fought.
