handsome building, erected in the year 1727, by the Magi-
strates and Council, who are patrons, in a very pleasant and
airy situation, on the Castle-hill.  The house is divided into
two apartments, which have separate entries, and which have
no communication with each other.  In the one are taught
Latin, French, Geography, etc.; in the other, English, writ-

of the English school, a salary of 17 l.  Both are paid by
the town.  The fees paid by the scholars, as regulated by

fair to attain its antient celebrity.
