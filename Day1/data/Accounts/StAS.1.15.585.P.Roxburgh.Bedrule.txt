station, as well as interest in the country, ought certainly to
set a better example, absent themselves from public worship
altogether, the disrespect that is thus shewn to law and reli-
gion, as well as disregard to the inclination, convenience, and
comfort of the people, is, in our opinion, equally impolitic in
them as it is illegal and profane.  For, we may expect, and
we pray God it be nor in some degree the case already, that
the contempt that has been of late so generally thrown on re-
ligion and its peaceful adherents, may, in time, excite the
multitude, who are but too apt to imitate the vices of their
superiors, rather than their virtues, to shake off their honest,
as well as pious principles, and at last to become, if not as
profane, at least as corrupt as too many of those who esteem
themselves their betters.  When this event takes place, which,
if not wisely prevented, may be nearer than many of us ima-
gine, those who have done the mischief must feverely feel the
effects of it, and will thereby, though, perhaps, too late, find
the necessity, from the want of a better principle, of letting the
example of a proper regard to the laws of God and their coun-
try, for their own interest and in their own defence.  For, what-
ever false and vain philosophers may pretend, a nation or peo-
ple, without religion will also be without principle.
   But the writer, when he has said thus much, is at the same
time happy, with great justice and equal pleasure, to be able
to add, that by far the greater part of the heritors or land-
holders of Scotland are of a very different description.  And,
therefore, from a real regard to the worship of God, the com-
fort, good will, and convenience of the people, and concern
for the credit of their native country, as well as from their
high respect for its constitution and laws, they have the pa-
rish churches, where their lands are situated, not only decent
and comfortable, but some of them elegant.
