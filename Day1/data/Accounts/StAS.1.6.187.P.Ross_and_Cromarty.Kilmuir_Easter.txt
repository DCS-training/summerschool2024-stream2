glected, but dismantled of its principal ornaments: the largest
forest trees ever seen in this country were cut down, and sold
to a company at Leith; much of the ground within the policy
was parcelled out in lots to disbanded soldiers and sailors; and
the most elegant and best finished house in the three countries
was allowed to fall into ruins.  The place however promises,
in a few years hence, to recover its antient beauty and gran-
duer.-The late Lord M'Leod, immediately upon the restora-
tion of his estate, began to extend and inclose the policy; planted
many thousand forest and fir trees, which are now in a thriv-
ing condition; and built a superb house upon a modern plan,
which, in point of elegance and accommodation, is inferior to
few seast in Scotland.  What was left unfinished of his lord-
ship's plans, are now carried on with attention and taste by
Captain Kenneth M'Kenzie, his successor, and the representa-
tive of that honourable family.

   Farms and Rent.-The disproportion of farms in this pa-
rish is very great; some renting 50, some 100, and some 150
acres, while others possess no more than from 3 to 12.  By an
union of farms that lately took place, many of the small te-
nants were obliged to retire to the waste grounds, 2 limited
portion of which is assigned to each of them by the proprie-
tors: here they plant potatoes; and, by industry and perseve-
rance, bring two, three, or more acres to culture, in the
course of 7 years; during which time, they fir rent-free, ex
cepting a small acknowledgement in hens and eggs.  There is
no other encouragement given them, excepting an advence of
20s.  to assist them in building a house, the value of which they
must leave upon the ground when they remove; and, if they
continue in possession after the 7 years are exzpired, they pay,
some less and some more, for every acre in cultivation.
