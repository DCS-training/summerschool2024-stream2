however, owing to the fortunate slopings of the eminences,
and the largeness of the interjacent flats, there are many fields
well adapted to the purposes of agriculture, which have, ac-

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-In the hilly parts of the parish, the
climate, although cold, is reckoned more healthy, than in the

by the Ochil Hills, which obstruct the sun's influence, while

fewer than 56 children died of it, in the town of Newburgh.

prove.

   Rivers.-No river runs through this parish.  The Tay,
which washes its northern extremity, more properly form-
