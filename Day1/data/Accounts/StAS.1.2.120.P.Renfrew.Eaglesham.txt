and the real rent about L. 2700 sterling.  The Eglinton fami-
ly do not reside; but the other three heritors possess their own
farms, on which they live comfortably.  The number of te-
nants is greatly diminished, within these twenty years, by the
junction of farms.  At present there are only 63, without in-
cluding those who take the parks adjacent to the village.  The 
principal tenants pay L. 80, L. 90, and several above L. 100
yearly rent.  The lands in general let at 16s or 20s per acre,
but those near the village at above 30s.-The number of 
people from six years old or upwards, is 700, and there are

decrease may be about 100.  The baptisms, including those of
the Seceders, are, at an average, about 25, the marriages
about 9 or 10, but no register of deaths has been kept.

six hundred years standing.  The church and village lie about
a mile from this antient fabric.  An old Popish chapel, a ve-

these two years; when Lord Eglinton, much to his honour,
erected a most elegant church, of an octagonal form, and fit-
ted it up in the best manner.  The village of Eaglesham is al-
lowed by every traveller who has seen it to be one of the most
delightful places in Great Britain.  Twenty years ago, it was
