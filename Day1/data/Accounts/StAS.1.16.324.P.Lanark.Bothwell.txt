   Battle of Bothwell Bridge.-The south side of this bridge
was the scene of an engagement in the reign of Charles II.
1679, between the whigs or covenanters, and the King's
army, commanded by the Duke of Monmouth.  The
King's army advanced by the north, or Bothwell side.  The
covenanters, divided among themselves, were soon thrown
into confusion; 400 were killed, chiefly in the pursuit, and
1200 taken prisoners.  It is said that they did not expect to
fight, being misinformed that the Duke was ordered to ob-
serve pacific measures.  It is told by the historians of those
times.
