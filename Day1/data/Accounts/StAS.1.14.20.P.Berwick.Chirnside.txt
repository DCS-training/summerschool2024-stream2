     Statistical Account

adopt the sentiment of Old Hesiod, and say, that the half
profit is better than the whole.
   Wherever the lands, in any country, are cultivated
in the manner, and to the extent, that has been repre-
sented, there an increased population must take place.
For, whether the proprietors retain and improve their
own lands, or let them to tenants, the greater the ex-
tent of the culture is, the more hands are required to
carry it forward.  To this assertion, it will be objected,
that the heritor may cast around his mansion-house plea-
sure-grounds, or extensive sheep-fields, which employ
few labouring people; but, besides that the instances of the
first case are rare, and confined to the greatest proprie-
tors, it is to be considered, that unless mere wildernesses
be created by them, in place of fine lawns, or walks of
pleasure, such works, as the latter, cannot be accomplish-
ed without a vast deal of previous cultivation, and calling
in labourers of several kinds.  As to thier sheep-fields,
if the flock much exceed one convenient for domestic ser-
vices, they must have the knowledge, and exert all the
attention, of real husbandmen, to find this sole use of their
lands always profitable; for even the best substitution of
the management will prove defective.  Thus, in the or-
dinary course of things, it must come to pass, as it ought
to do, that the proprietors of lands, to whom it belongs
to begin all new improvements, and to verify in practice
their good effects, will not find it for their interest, or
their pleasure, to act the part of real farmers, for a lenght
of time, and beyond a moderate extent.  It is their pro-
vince to show, what may, and should be done; but as the
utmost reach of their labour is limited, and must be show
in the progress, the extension of agriculture over any
large district of a country, must be looked for, and can
