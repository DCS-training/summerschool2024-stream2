     Statistical Account

dable and pious institution, the rapid progress of improvement
in the Highlands may in a great measure be attributed.  There is
also a school, supported by the heritors, at the village of Dull,
at which about 100 children are taught.  Such as chuse, may
there receive the benefit of classical learning: hitherto it has
been superintended by men who received a liberal education;
but, as the salary is only L. 80 Scotch, and the perquisites and
school fees very low, it is to be seared that young men of this
description will not consider it as an object worth their atten-
tion.
   The number of poor upon the roll, in the whole parish, is
40.  What money is expended for their supports is collected in
the church on Sundays, which annually amounts to L. 24, or
thereaboits.  Particular attention is paid only to the case of
such as are bed-rid.  All who are able to go about to ask chari-
ty, receive very little from the parochial funds.  It must be
consessed, that hitherto this part of our constitution has not
been sufficiently attended to.  If this, however, and the neigh-
bouring parishes, were to support their own poor, there is good
reason to think, that both parties would be gainers by it: the
poor would be better provided for; and the country would
not be insested by so many sturdy beggars as pour in upon it
from the north, during the months of June, July, and Au-
gust.

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-The roads, upon the whole, are in
tolerable good order.  Of late, a great deal has been done to
improve them, and much still remains to perform.  The king's
road between Stirling and Inverness passes through this parish.
There are no turnpikes.  The country roads are made and
kept in repair by the statute work, exacted in kind: but it is
to be wished that this mode were altered, and that the occu-
piers of land were assesses in a moderate sum of money.  By
