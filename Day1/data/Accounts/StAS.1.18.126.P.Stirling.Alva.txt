and a half; and from south to north, rather more than four
miles.  Tillicoultry, is the adjacent parish on the east.  The
river Devon, which has its source in the barony of Alva, after
a long course, at first almost due east; and then southward
through Glen-devon, makes a sudden turn westward, near
the church of Fossoway, and passing through the parishes of
Muckhart, Dollar, and Tillicoultry, gently glides along the
south boundary of this parish, and divides it from the parishes
of Alloa and Clackmannan, which are situated on the south*.
The parish of Logie is next adjacent on the west.

   Extent, etc.-The lands of Alva extend over a very con-
siderable portion of that long range of hills, distinguished by
the name of Ochills; the remaining grounds are extended
over part of that valley, which lies between the foot of these
hills, and the river Devon.  The mean breadth, from the
banks of the river to the bottom of the hill, may be about
three fifth parts of a mile.
   That portion of the Ochills now under review, when seen
from the south at the distance of a mile or two, appear to be
one continued range, with little variation in height; but as
the mountain slopes towards the south,* it is intersected by
exceedingly deep and narrow glens, through each of which,
streams of water run, that discharge themselves into the De-

*It is impossible to view this little river of clear water, without admiring
its beauty, in its wonderful passage through the rock, at the Rumbling Bridge,
and Caldion Lin; and its numberless meandrings, after it descends into the
valley, east of Dollar; whence it glides generally in a deep bed with little
fall, till it reaches the Frith of Forth, at the Cambas miln, directly opposite
to where its source began.  When swelled by heavy rains, or the melting
snow, it overflows its banks, and covers the greatest part of the low
grounds.
