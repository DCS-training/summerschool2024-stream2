the population at different periods.  When I was settled in
1763, I never heard of any list being taken by Dr Web-
ster; and when I visited my parish next year, and took an
accurate list both of the town and country, many in the
parish were much offended at me; they had never heard
of such a thing being done before, and compared my con-
duct to the sin of David in numbering the people.  I should
not have apprehended there would have been a great in-
crease in the population, but there is no reason to suppose
there would have been 60 people fewer in 1764 than in
1755, unless the long continuance of the war should have
had any influence in diminishing the numbers in the parish.
If Dr Webster calculated the number of the parishoners
from the register of baptisms, I am certain there were no
sufficient data on which he could proceed.

   Religious Sects.-In the lists of 1764 and 1769, which
were accurately taken by myself, by visiting every family
in the parish, there were no Dissenters from the Established
Church but Episcopals, that persuasion for a long time was
the prevailing mode of religion in this parish, and it is still
professed by the wealthiest inhabitants of the town.  They
were all then of the Scotch Episcopal Church; since that
time they are divided into Scotch and English Episcopals.
From two notes, which I have received from the ministers
of both these congregations, I find there is at present nearly
1100 Episcopals.  Since 1769, there were a few Roman
Catholics in the parish for a few years; there are none at
present with whom I am acquainted.  Somewhat more
than 20 years ago, a Seceder meeting-house was erected
about 8 or 9 miles from this place; since that time a few
Seceders have been in this parish, but they are not at pre-
sent numerous; I really do not know their precise number,
nor could I easily ascertain it; a church was built by them
