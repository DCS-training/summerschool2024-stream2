     Inclosures.--Although something in this way is done annually
   yet this species of improvement may yet be said to be in its in-
   fancy.

        Distillery.--About twelve years ago, a distillery was erected on
      the estate of Montblairy, which is still in full and active operation.
      The extensive premises connected with this work are most com-
      plete and convenient, and being situated on an airy and romantic
      ridge of rock, and abundantly supplied with the purest water, the
      whisky produced is of first rate excellence, and greatly celebrated
      for its genuine flavour. This distillery was erected at an       se
      of L.4000, is capable of distilling 40,000 gallons annually, and in
      size ranks among the largest north of the Tay. Mr Alexander
      Scott is proprietor of the works.
                             V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
        Means of Communication, &c.-There are no villages or mar-
      kets within the parish.  Banff, at the distance of two miles from
      the northern extremity, is the nearest market-town. The post-
      offices at Banff, Abereberder, and Turriff, lie at nearly equal dis-
      tances from the extreme points of the parish. The turnpike road
      leading from Banff to Huntly extends within the parish to the dis-
      tance of four miles and a half, and the turnpike branching off
      from this at the Slacks of Tipperty, enters the parish of Forglen
      on the moors above Montblairy, at the distance offour miles. To
      these may be added one mile of new turnpike leading from Bur-
      reldales, in the direction of Forglen House, making in all an ex-
      tent of nine miles and a half of turnpike roads within the parish.

   <FOOTNOTE>The rates at which the grain is calculated in this table, is the average of Banff-
      shire flar prices, for common oats with fodder, and for beat bear with fodder, from
      1829 to 1835 inclusive. No pasture is let for grazing in the parish, so that the ex-
      tent stated in the tables is to be considered as the pasture on which the farmers rear
      their own stock.
         In writing the preceding remarks on the subject of agriculture, the writer has con-
      sulted the opinions ofthe most intelligent practical farmers in the parish, and has Te-
      ceived from them many lengthened written communications, the substance of which
      could only be presented ina very abridged and imperfect shape.
