three, large trenches.  In Torthowald moor there is a cairn;
and a ring or circle formed of small stones.

   Character, etc. of the People.-The inhabitants of this parish
are generally very sober, honest, and industrious; and live com-
fortably and at an easy rate.  They feed much on potatoes
and on pork.  It is very common for the cottagers to buy a
pig, which they fatten up for some months, and then kill.  A few
of the men are six feet high, and some above that stature; a
considerable number are greatly above the common size; and
their complexion is tolerable.  None enlist in the army; but
several enter into the navy.  In 1750, five farmers emigrated
from this parish to the isle of Bute, where they engaged in
farms, but about 10 years afterwards, 3 of them returned to
Torthorwald and the neighbourhood.  This parish has pro-
duced 10 preachers of the gospel since 1762.  Many young
men have gone abroad in different lines, several of whom have
been successful, and have done honour to the place of their
nativity.

   Bills of Mortality.-In forming the tables of mortality, (see
appendix) it was intended, in as far as consisted with accuracy,
to preserve the common names by which the diseases are known.
Where these are either not sufficiently distinctive, or where one
name is used to express more than one kind of disease, num-
bers are added expresive of the genus they belong to in Cullen's
Nosology.  No diseases are mentioned for children under
one year of age, unless they have died of the small pox, mea-
sles, or chincough, and therefore they are put into one column.
The column marked "Internal chronic complaints, etc." are
cases where no other definite name could be thought of, and 
where they are in general thought to arise from obstructions
