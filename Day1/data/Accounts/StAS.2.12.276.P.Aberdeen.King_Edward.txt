many places, it consists of a black loam upon a gravelly or rocky
subsoil; in others, it is of a clayey nature.  On the low grounds
on the banks of the Doveran, it is principally alluvial, and very
rich. On the higher grounds, in the eastern quarter, it is gene-
rally mossy, superincumbent upon a gravelly or clayey subsoil.  In
some places it is very fertile, in others the returns are poor.
   There are extensive mosses on the estates of Fisherie and
Byth, from which the inhabitants are supplied with peats and turf
for fuel.
   There is nothing very remarkable in the mineral productions.
Greywacke and clay-slate are found in the western quarter, and
red sandstone in the eastern.  It is believed, also, that a quan-
tity of iron ore exists in the parish.

                      II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Eminent Men.-Among the eminent characters who have been
connected with this parish, may be mentioned Dr William Guild,
who was minister here in the early part of the seventeenth cen-
tury, for about twenty-two years.  He was afterwards one of the
ministers of Aberdeen, and Principal of King's College.  He pub-
lisbed several theological works, and seems to have been a man of
very considerable learning, as well as of much benevolence of
mind.  He endowed an hospital in Aberdeen, now enjoying an
ample revenue, for the incorporated trades of that city, and this pa-
rish receives yarly L.6, 10s. from the treasurer of Aberdeen,
being the interest of a mortification made by his widow, Catharine
Rolland, for, the benefit of the poor.
