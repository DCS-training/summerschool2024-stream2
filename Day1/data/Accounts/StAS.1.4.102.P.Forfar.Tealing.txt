   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people, in general, are
of the middle size.  They are exceedingly industrious,
economical, rather plainer in dress than their neigh-
bours, and not fond of a military life.  Generally they
are charitable and very helpful to one another.  The
condition of the people, for the most part, is rather
more than tolerable, and they are apparently contented
with it.  It might, however, be, in some measure, improved
at nogreat expense, by making their cottages more comfort-
able and convenient, by raising better fences round their
gardens, and introducing among them to culture of 2
few more nourishing vegetables.

   The roads, in general, are bad, and have been much ne-
glected.  An act, however, has been lately obtained for
turnpikes throughout the county, and is already begun to
be put in execution, but many people think they will
prove too expensive.

   The rent of the greater part of the open land is about
9 s. the acre.  Some, however, in the hands of the smaller
tenants, gives from 15 s. to 20 s.  Inclosed ground lets
from 15 s. to 25 s. according to its quality.  The farms are
from about 100 to 150 acres; two farmers, however, pos-
sess considerably more.  The number of farms is rather
increasing, and many cottars and subtenants have, within
these 20 years, been put immediately under their lairds.
