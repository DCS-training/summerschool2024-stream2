vantages which admits of no remedy.  They exist more in
idea than in reality; and are owing, for the most part, to in-
attention to proper means of industry.
   The writer of this article has long contemplated with plea-
sure the advantages that would arise, not solely to this coun-
try, but also to all Britain, were manufactories of linen and
woollen cloth carried on individually; that is, a loom, or
looms, established in each farm-house, in proportion to the
farmer's abilities.  In this parish there are at least 600 acres
perfectly adapted for flax.  The objection, that this mode of
manufacture would interfere with the business of the farm,
vanishes, by the possibility of making them distinct and sepa-
rate objects, so as that the one party should at no time inter-
fere with the department of the other.  Add to this, that a
source of gain is of all others the most powerful source of in-
dustry; the produce of labour being easily transported to a
ready market.
   It will be said, that establishing villages in proper situa-
tions would be a preferable mode of carrying on manufacto-
ries.  The writer of this article is unfortunately singular in
his idea of the utility of villages.  They are ornaments to a
country, but too frequently nurseries of political disquisition.
-Villages, it will be argued, afford a ready market even for
trivial articles from a farm.  But the profits arising therefrom
are only seemingly advantageous.  The farmer's wife or daugh-
ter repairs to the village to dispose of her basket of eggs.  This
is one advantage arising from the neighbourhood of a village.
But, what is the consequence?  She returns loaded with tea,
sugar, a bottle of wine as a cordial or medicine, some yards of
fine muslin, silk and satin: articles the never would have dreamt
of, had she not been ensnared by the glare and show of a fine
shop, and unfortunately forgot the most necessary petition,
'into temptation lead me not,'
