field, will only require to be limed at the half of the above
rate, being 3 chalders, or 2 1/4 tons lime shells to each acre.
   The navigation of the Forth could not be carried farther
than Gartmore, nor of the Teith farther than Kilmahog, so
we shall reckon the land carriage along the river to these
points to be 9 milcs, as a medium for the whole extent; for
which space, the land carriage of a ton of lime, shells, or
coals, will cost at least 10 s.
   It is impossible to ascertain exactly the quantity of coal the
above families will consume.  But we shall suppose an ordi-
nary farmer's consumpt to be a standard for the whole.  Now,
an ordinary farmer, if be burn nothing else than coal, can-
not be allowed less than 20 carts annually; of which, the
carriage by land, including the prime cost on the hill, will be
9 s. per cart, in all 9 L. sterling annually.
   It may be said that a great number of the families will
manufacture peats, and thus save the expence of coal.  Now
let us submit this alternative to the test of calculation.  The
collector of these reports was at the pains to question a far-
mer in the parish of Kilmadock on this subject.  He kept
one fire in his kitchen through the whole year, and another
sire for about six months of the year; and these fires were
supplied by peats from his own moss, and coals from Ban-
nockburn or Auchinbowie.  He consumed annually 8 carts
of coals, and employed 2 men and 4 women for a month,
annually, in manufacturing peats, and 4 horses and carts for
2 weeks.
