and empties itself into the sea, about 3 miles E. of the church,
on a flat sandy beach.  On each side of the river, the fields,
in the western district of the parish, slope gradually towards its
channel; but at the village of Linton, a little way above the
church, the stream, after falling over some broken rocks, of
considerable height, runs chiefly through a flat fertile haugh,
till it reaches the sea.  In this lower part of the river, consi-
derable quantities of salmon are caught, and excellent trouts
through the whole run; but it is thought the numbers of the
former, would be much increased, were the rocks that in-
terrupt the channel at Linton Bridge, blown, so as to afford a
passage for them to get up more freely, and to spawn.

   Hill.-The only considerable hill in the parish is Traprane
Law, formerly called Dun-pender (two Gaelic words signifying
Steep Hill), an appellation to which, from its appearance,
especially on the south side, it is well entitled. Its height is
about 700 feet above the level of the sea; and it forms one
of the most conspicuous objects to mariners, after entering the
mouth of the Frith of Forth.  From the top of it may be
seen part of 13 counties.
