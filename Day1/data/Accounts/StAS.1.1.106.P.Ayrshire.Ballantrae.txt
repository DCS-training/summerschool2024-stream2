in about 190 dwelling houses, which is a little more than 4
persons to each house.  One hundred and thirteen of the 
houses are in what is called the country; the other 77 make
the village or town of Ballantrae.  The inhabitants of both
town and country enjoy the comforts of society, in propor-
tion to their circumstances, in a superior degree to others in
similar conditions of life.  These satisfactions are owing to
various causes, all contributing their mite to render them
healthy, easy, and contented, and, in general, chearsol.

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-Their local situation, a high, open,
and dry soil, with upwards of 10 miles of sea coast, exposed
to the salubrious breezes of the western ocean, together with
their rural employments, renders the inhabitants uncommon-
ly healthy.  Epidemical distempers, excepting the common
disorders incident to children, are unknown.  Deaths, except
from particular accidents, are confined to infancy and old age.
There are a greater number to be met with in this parish
dying above 80 years of age than in most others.  It is to be
lamented that innoculation for the small-pox is not more
practiced.  There are very few families through the country
part of the parish, but what have a piece of ground along
with their house and yard, that enables them to keep one or
more cows, and two or three sheep.  The young of their
cows, when a year old, sells for 30 s. or 50 s. which pays two-
thirds of their rent.  With the produce of their little piece
of ground, furnishing bread and potatoes, and the milk of a
cow, together with their own work, they are enabled to live
comfortably, to clothe and educate their children decently,
and to assist in setting them out in the world.  The inhabi-
tants of the village, which lies close upon the shore, enjoy
advantages peculiar to their situation.
