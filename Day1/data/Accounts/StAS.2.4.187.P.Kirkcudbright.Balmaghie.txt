   The total number of acres in the parish way be estimated at
17,518 Scots. Of these, about 5472 are arable, and 12,046 remain
constantly waste or in pasture. Cultivation, it is believed, has
been extended over all the lands from which a profitable return
could reasonably be expected.
	Rent of Land,--The average rent of amble land is l5s. per
Scots acre. The real rental of the parish is L.6200. When the
Old Statistical Account was drawn up, the real rental was L.2640.
	Live-Stock.--Galloway cattle are reared over the whole parish,
and for them the farmers in general have a decided preference
over all other breeds. There are, however, on some of the farms,
a number of Ayrshire cows. In the higher districts, a number
of Highlanders are grazed. In regard to sheep, the black-faced
sort are of course the staple on the upland farms; but, on the
richer soils, crosses between the Leicester and Mug, or between
the Leicester and Cheviot, are also reared.
	The general duration of leases is nineteen years. The farm-
steadings are in general good; those on the estate of Balmag-
hie were all rebuilt near the beginning of this century, and
are excellent specimens of that class of buildings. Stone dikes
constitute the usual enclosure, and are, upon the whole, in a good
state of repair. In tillage husbandry, the seven shift rotation is
usually followed. Bone-dust is used to a considerable extent in
the raising of turnips, which are eaten off by sheep, and thus the
farmer is enabled to have an additional quantity of land under the
plough. A good deal of draining is every year done, but, as stones
are plentiful, tiles are not much used.
	Raw Produce.--The average gross amount of raw produce an-
tiually raised in the parish may be estimated as follows:
