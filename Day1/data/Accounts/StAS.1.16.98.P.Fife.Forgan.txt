     Statistical Account

   Religious Sects.-There are not many Dissenters in the
parish; only two Episcopalians, and a few Antiburgher
Seceders, most of whom had left the Established Church
before the present incumbent was settled here.  Some of
them left the Secession, and came to the parish church;
but when the new mode of singing without reading the
line was introduced, they again withdrew, and carried two
or three individuals a1ong with them.  They are sober and
industrious, not at all so bigotted as are many of that sect
they are very useful members of society.

   Poor.-There are no begging poor belonging to the pa-
rish but many such from Perth and other places.  By
these, and travelling tinkers, this part of the country is not
a little oppressed.  It is much to be regretted that each parish
does not take care of its own poor, and hinder them from
travelling abroad to other parishes.  Besides the number
of pensioners on the poors roll, which sometimes does not
exceed 4, there are not a few who obtain a temporary sup-
ply of 10 s. 15 s. or L. 1, at a time when sickness is in the
family, or the head of it unable to work.  Parents who are
not able to pay for the education of their children, have
them educated upon the poors funds, which are made up
from the weekly collections on Sabbath, to which the sea-
faring people, of all others, contribute most liberally.  The
annual amount of the collections is above L. 14 Sterling.
A farmer in the parish, at his death, some few years ago,
left a legacy of L. 20 Sterling.  This made a considerable
addition to the fund, which has been more than doubled
within these 30 years.  It is managed by the kirk-session
with care and attention, withot, the least expence to the
fund.
