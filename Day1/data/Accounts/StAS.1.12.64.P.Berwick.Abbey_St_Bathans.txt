     Statistical Account

The rental of the parish is about 600 L. a-year.  The Crown
is patron of the church.  The value of the living, exclusive of
the manse and glebe of 14 acres, is about 52 L. a year.  The
church is a very ancient building; it was formerly large, mea-
suring 58 feet by 26, but a part of the wall was lately taken
down by the desire of the heritors, and the size of the church
greatly contracted; it is still sufficiently large to accommodate
the inhabitants of the parish.

   Antiquities.-Between the church and the water of Whit-
adder, are the remains of an ancient nunnery; it is almost to-
tally demolished, the stones having been carried away for
other purposes; from the vestiges, however, which are still
to be seen, the building seems to have been of considerable
extent.  From any materials that I have been able to collect,
this nunnery, of Abbay of St. Bathan's, seems to have been
founded by one of the Countesses of March, during the reign
of King William the Lyon, who succeeded to the Crown of
Scotland in 1165, and reigned 49 years; so that it must have
happened between 1165 and 1214.  In 1296, Ada, Countess
of March, swore fidelity for this nunnery to Edward I. King
of England, who had then subdued great part of Scotland;
and in return, directed a writ to the sheriff of Berwick to re-
store to the nunnery all its lands and tenements.  It was a
cell of South Berwick, and the nuns were of the order of
Bernardines or Cistertians.  This religious order had been
begun by Robert, Abbot of Milesme, in the diocese of Lon-
gres in France, in 1098-were called Monachi Abbi, White
Monks, from their wearing white robes, except a black coul
or scopular-were called Bernardines from Bernard, the great
propagator of the order, who founded 160 monasteries, di-
vided into 36 provinces, whereof Scotland was 26th, and had
13 monasteries-were called Cistertians from their chief house
