   Rate of Wages.--The usual wage of an able-bodied labourer is
2s. a-day in summer, and 1s. 8d. in winter, without victuals.
When constant employment is given, the wage is 10s. a-week
throughout the year. Women get from 1s. to 1s. 6d. a-day.
Our farmers, however, are not much in the habit of employing
day-labourers, except for harvest-work; and that is now most
frequently done by the piece, at the rate of 14s. for wheat, and
11s. for oats or barley, per Scots acre. Potatoes are usually dug
at the rate of from 8d. to 10d. per boll of 6 cwt. The ordinary
work of the farm is done by hired servants, who have their bed and
board in the farmer's house, and form part of his family. The
common wage of a good ploughman is about L. 9, 9s. per half-
year; of an inferior ploughman, L.8. The wage of an experi-
enced dairy-maid is from L. 5, 5s. to L. 6 per half-year, and of
other female servants from L. 3 to L. 4, 10s. Masons' wages
are 16s. or 17s. a-week; and carpenters' Is. more.
