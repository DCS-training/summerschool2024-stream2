in the situation of the county, it was less hazardous than the
epidemic."
   The country practice here is most fatiguing to a medical
practitioner; the roads are bad, and, considering the extent
of the county, it is thinly inhabited; attendance, however,
on my young patients became the more necessary, as the
hot temperature, and such internal phlogistics, as pure
whisky, is generally adopted."
   "By an accurate journal, from October 1796, to July
1797, my numbers amounted to 645."
   "Under the disadvantages I laboured, of the numbers in-
oculated, bad roads, a propensity to the opposite treatment I

dren, whom I had a strong reluctance to inoculate, were
the only victims."
   "It is singular, that notwithstanding the general inocula-
tion in every other parish, none, unless gentlemens children,
were at that time inoculated in the parish of Latheron."
   "Deducting the parish of Latheron, the population of
Caithness does not exceed 21,000 souls.  I am inclined
therefore to believe, that there has not been so general an
inoculation in Scotland, during so short a period as eight
months."
   "I am well satisfied, from attentive observation to prac-
tice, that any season is suited to a favourable event of inocula-
tion.  The warmth of summer is urged as a material objec-
tion to inoculation at that season.  I am fearful, that the
refrigerant plan is very generally carried so far, as in many
cases to be productive of bad effects; and I have no doubt,
that the temperature of our patient's room, may be reduced
to the cool degree, needed at any season."
   "In the West Indies they rarely have the choice of season,
as inoculation is seldom practice; but when a vessel has ap-
peared, with the disease on board, then a general inoculation
