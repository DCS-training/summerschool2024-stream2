plant.  The process is easy, viz. take 3 large ripe apples from
a stem of your favourite potatoe.  Preserve them carefully
from the winter frosts.  About the beginning of April pre-
pare a bit of good rich garden ground.  With a wooden
pole form small drills in it about an inch deep.  Pick the
seeds out of the apples, and sow them as regularly as possible
in these drills, and cover the seed with about half an inch
depth of earth.  In the mean time prepare another piece of
good rich ground; and when the potatoe seedling plants
have grown about an inch high above the ground, carefully
raise them, with as much earth about the plants, respective-
ly, as possible, and transplant them into the other piece of
prepared ground, at the distance of 10 inches betwixt the
plants in the row; and the distance of 14 inches betwixt
the rows.  Hoe them when needful, and take them up
when ripe.  If they have been thus cared for, you will have
many of them as large as small hen eggs the first season.
And, if you plant these seedling potatoes in good ground
next spring, give them plenty of room, and take good care
of them, you will, against next autumn, find their produce
arrived at the full size of potatoes planted in the ordinary
way.  And from the seed of these three apples, you will
have, the second year, upwards of 4 bolls of potatoes.  And
these potatoes, thus raised from the apple-seed, will continue,
for several years, more prolific than potatoes which have not,
for many years, been raised from the apple-seed.
   If you plant the early potatoe called the London-Lady, or
the early potatoe called the Glory of England, in rich, dry,
warm lying ground, in the beginning of April, your crop
will be ready for the market by the 20th of July.  And if
you then dress the same ground, and plant it with the same
species of potatoes, which have been kept over the winter,
and, by lying in a dry well-aired place, and by being fre-
