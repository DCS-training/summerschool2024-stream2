ground being completely covered with the crop, it is not so
soon affected.
   In the N. W. end of the parish, the face of the ground
is still more diversified.  A considerable part of this tract,
upwards of 1000 acres, consisting of moor and moss, is
incapable of tillage.  In the arable ground, which consists
chiefly of hills scattered amidst the moor and moss, the
soil is coarser, and less productive.  But this arises, not
so much from an original difference in the nature of the
land, as from the want of improvement.  For the soil is
here much of the same quality, agrees with the same kind
of season, and when well improved, produces the same
kinds of grain, as that formerly described.
   The N. E. part of the parish, lying along the Bishop-
burn, is of a soil and surface different from both the form-
er.  This tract, of about 2 miles in length, and 1 1/2 in
breadth, bears all the marks of having been once covered
by the sea.  It is almost one continued level, and lies far
lower than the rest of the parish, perhaps 200 feet below
the tops of the adjacent hills.  The soil, as well as the
bed on which it rests, consists of a kind of sea sleech, con-
densed into a hard substance, intermixed with shells, form-
ed in strata, and of great depth.  In a subsequent period,
and long after the sea had receded, this tract must have
been covered with trees; the trunks of which are still
found, in great numbers, interspersed over the whole of
it.  They consist of various kinds, but mostly of oak, many
of them between 30 and 40 feet long, and lying generally in
the same directions as having been felled by the west wind,
which is the most violent in this place: A great part of
this tract, perhaps the half of it, is still covered with moss;
which seems to have been formerly much more extensive,
a considerable deal of it having been cleared away within
