     of Avoch.

The church was new roofed, and otherwise improved in
1792.  The manse, built in 1672, has undergone several re-
parations since, and is now a comfortable lodging.  The
ministers, since the Restoration of Presbytery, and dates of
their settlements, have been:
     1712-13-Mr Alexander M'Bean, afterwards mini-
          ter at Inverness.
     1716. Mr Alexander Ray, who died here in 1735.
     1736. Mr Alexander Fraser, translated in 1755 to
        Inverness.
     1756. Mr Thomas Simpson, who died here in 1786.
     Sept. 1787. Mr James Smith, the present incumbent.

   The minister of Avoch is co-administrator with the mini-
ster of Rosemarky, of the fund which pays the masters sala-
ries in the academy at Fortrose; and of some lands bequeath-
ed by a late Countess of Seaforth, for the support of the poor
in same burgh.
   The parochial school of Avoch is attended by about 50
scholars.  The master's salary, payable by the heritors, is
6 L. 13 s. 4 d. Sterling.  His wages and emoluments, as session
clerk and presenter, may, communibus annis, amount to 3 L.
more.  He teaches English, Latin, Writing, Arithmetic,
Book-keeping, and Church music.  But the fees from his
scholars, as the tenantry in general are not able to afford
much, will seldom exceed 10 L. Sterling.  So that this office
is scarcely worth 20 L. a year.
   There is a sewing school for girls in the Kirktown, and
two or three small schools in different corners of the parish,
for initiating young children to read, but they have no sala-
ries.
   A sunday school, on a proper plan, and a spinning school,
for teaching young girls to work at the two-handed wheel,
would both be found exceedingly useful institutions in such
