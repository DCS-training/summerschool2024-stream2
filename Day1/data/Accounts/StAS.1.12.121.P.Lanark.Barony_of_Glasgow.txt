*Though.  from the above statement it appears, that the number of dissent-
ers from the Established Church is very considerable, yet, perhaps there are few
parishes where less of a party-spirit is to be found.  The people of various
situations meet in the intercourses of social life, and even cultivate habits of in-
timacy and friendship with each other, without suffering their minds to be em-
bittered with disputes respecting their differences of opinion or prosession.
this liberality of mind, they have an amiable example set them by their mini-
sters, who are men of good sense, learning, and piety.  And it is with pleasure
I do them the justice to acknowledge, that the dissenters, in general, are as
pious, virtuous, upright, industrious, and respectable, as any in the parish.
