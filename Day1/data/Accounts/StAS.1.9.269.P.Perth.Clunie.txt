     of Clunie.

the son of Sir Robert Crichton of Elliock, Lord Advo-
cate of Scotland, who was proprietor of the whole barony
of Clunie, and who was succeeded in that property by his
oldest son Sir David Crichton, the initials of whole name,
together with those of his wife's, who was an ancestor of
the present Stewarts of Ballechin, are still to be seen, with
a lion rampant, all in relief, on a triangular stone in the
east wall of the castle.  Without entering into any disqui-
sition with respect to the wonderful abilities of James Crich-
ton, which we believe his eulogists have greatly exaggera-
ted, we beg leave to refer for particulars to the new Edin-
burgh Encyclop‘dia, which contains perhaps the most un-
exceptionable account of him.  His successive adventures at
Paris, Rome, Venice, Padua, and Mantua, are recorded at
large in the 3d vol. of Dr M'Kenzie's Scotch lives; in the
81st No. of the Adventurer; in the 1st vol. of Pennant's
first Tour through Scotland; and in the Edinburgh Maga-
zine and Review for June 1774, in which last, there is a
small portrait of Crichton, taken from the original paint-
ings of him, which are said to be still extant in many col-
lections on the continent.  He was represented on horse-
back, with a sword in the one hand, and a book in the o-
ther, as emblems of his having excelled equally in the ma-
nual and literary exercises.  At Venice he contracted an
intimate friendship with the younger Manutius, a man of
great learning, and of an honest and respectable character,
who relates many things of him on his own personal know-
ledge.  He was an eye-witness to Crichton's behaviour,
both in the presence of the Doge and Senate of Venice,
and at the disputation at Padua; and may therefore be re-
garded as an indubitable testimony to the truth of both.
The cause and manner of Crichton's premature and unhap-
py death, will perhaps still remain in some degree of obscu-
rity; but we have the authority of Manutius for believing
