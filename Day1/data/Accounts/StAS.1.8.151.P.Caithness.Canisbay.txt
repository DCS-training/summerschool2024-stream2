dusky bottom comes on a level with the sea, with whose
waves it holds communication, by an opening at the base of
the intervening rock.  The bridge betwixt this fearful chasm,
and the edge of the main rock, towards the sea, is about six
yards wide.  On the highest part of the head, about 50 yards
from the edge of the precipice, there are to be seen indubi-
table marks of some house, or mansion, heretofore erected by
the hand of man.  Its base, which is all that now remains, is
perfectly circular, and about 20 feet wide.  It has probably
been occupied as a watch tower, or place of observation, cor-
responding with another, the vestiges of which are to be seen
on the top of Warth hill, at about the distance of 2 miles.
   South from the Head, for about 5 miles, the Warth hill
extends its base to the sea brink.  The coast is every where
exceeding bold, and the wild and varied magnificence of the
rocks are peculiarly striking to the eye of a stranger.  Be-
yond, for about a mile, the coast subsides into a beautiful
sandy beach winding around the bay, till it reaches
the mansion-house of Freswick.  Here the coast again re-
fumes its boldness, which continues with little variation, till it
reaches the confines of the parish.  The lands adjacent to the
shore, for the last 3 miles, (a little moor south of Freswick
excepted,) are all under cultivation.  The coast is beautiful;
the soil luxuriant and productive.
   The north coast has but little of that stupendous boldness,
for which the eastern one is so remarkable.  In coming down
from the Head, and travelling westward for two miles, the
walk is extremely pleasant.  The greater luxuriancy of
growth prevails, extending from the shore about a mile inland.
The beach itself consists wholly of shells and shell sand, of the
purest white, which contribute alike to beautify the coast,
and to enrich the soil.  In the middle of this delightful walk,
you approach the celebrated residence of JOHN O'GROAT; but,
