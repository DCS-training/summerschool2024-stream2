practice of raising them by lazy beds ought not to be em-
ployed, when they are to be planted on new or wild ground.
The spade reclaims such ground better than the plough, and
if the surface is rough with herbage, the expence of dung is
saved.
   Irrigation, or the watering of pasture and heath grounds,
should be tried, wherever it is practicable.  The operation
is easy, not expensive, and will have certain success in im-
proving grass and extirpating heath.  The Dowally farmer
sees proof of this success before him.  On the east end of a
little island, near Kilmorich, there is always a better and
more luxuriant sward of grass than on any other part of it,
and the obvious cause of the superiority is, that end is
occasionally overflowed by the Tay, which hapens to
form, from the situation of the place, when the river is
high, a sheet of still water upon it.  It is no objection to
the plan in question, that the Tay and the Tumble often
overflow part of the haughs near their banks, and instead of
improving, desolate them, by depositing the gravel they
have torn from the mountains.  The plan does not recom-
mend the employment of torrents for its purposes.  It re-
commends the making water to stagnate, for a time, on le-
vel grounds, and to draw surrows along grounds that slope,
in which the water may be led in very slender streams, and
which it may be made to overflow at such points, and in
such quantity, as, without breaking it, to irrigate or moisten
the whole surface*.
