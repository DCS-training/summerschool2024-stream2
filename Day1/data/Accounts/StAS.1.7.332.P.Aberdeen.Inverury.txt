of Buchan, the king of England's general in Scotland, which
proved the beginning of that good fortune that attended
him ever after during the whole of his reign.  The oldest char-
ter is a novodamus by Queen Mary, narrating, that  " Inverury
had been a royal borough time immemorial, but the charter of
its erection lost in the time of the civil wars."   It is govern-
ed by a provost, three baillies, a dean of guild, a treasurer,
and three counsellors.  It does not appear to have ever been
a place considerable for trade or manufactures.  A great part
of the townsmen are mechanics, such as weavers, shoema-
kers, taylors, cart and square wrights, and blacksmiths; and
they are all employed in working for the inhabitants of the
town and neighbourhood; none in manufacturing articles for
market.  At the same time, they cultivate their small pieces
of property, of from one to six acres of land.  There are a-
bout 60 of these small proprietors of land within the borough,
called portioners; and the Earl of Kintore is proprietor of a-
bout one half of the land.  When let to tenants, it pays
from 10 s. to 40 s. Sterling the acre, according to its qua-
lity.  The women are generally employed in knitting stock-
ings for the Aberdeen manufacturers, and earn from l8 d. to
2 s. a week.

   Bridges.-The situated of Inverury, between two such
ccnsiderable rivers, and sometimes in land floods inaccessible
even with boats, on all sides but one, has been a great obsta-
cle to its improvement.  This obstacle is now, however, in a
great measure, happily removed.  By the public spirited ex-
ertions of the Earl of Kintore, and Doctor Thom the present
provost, subscriptions have been promoted for a bridge upon
Don; and an elegant and stately one was built last year, at
the south end of the town, which cost 2000 L. Sterling.  The
accommodation, however, is not complete without a bridge
