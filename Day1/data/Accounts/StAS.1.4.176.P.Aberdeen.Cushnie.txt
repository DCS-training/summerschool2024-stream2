from 5 feet 4 inches, to 6 feet; and that of the women,
from 5 feet 2 inches, to 5 feet 8 inches.  It is difficult to
say whether the people are, on the whole, contented with
their situation.  If I may hazard an opinion, I think they
are not.  The shortness of their leases, their high rents,
and the exorbitant wages of the labouring servants, render
the situation of the farmers very irksome.  I observe that
even the prices of the shoes worn by the country people,
although the dearest article of wearing apparel, are but a-
bout thrice the price for which they were bought about
40 years ago; whereas the fees or wages of labouring ser-
vants have still increased in a greater degree since that pe-
riod.  The shoes are as 1 s. to 3 s. Sterling; but the wages
as 15 s. to L. 3 Sterling.  I observe, however, that the
common people live rather better, and dress to more ad-
vantage than in former times; although every article of
wearing apparel, particularly that most necessary one, shoes,
are at least thrice the price for which they could have been
procured about 40 years ago.  This is no doubt, in some
measure, owing to the increase of manufacturers, and value
of cattle, which generally fetch triple, if not four times
the price they gave in former times.  Superstition seems
also, if I mistake not, to lose ground, and the manners
of the people are somewhat more polished.  Natural chil-
dren are by no means so frequent here, as formerly; al-
though delinquents are much less harshly dealt by.-
The statute-labour is generally exacted in kind, but the
roads are very indifferent.  There are no turnpikes; nor
do the people know enough about them, to form a judg-
ment of their utility.-In 1782 and 1783, the crop was
remarkably deficient, and the oat-meal very bad; inso-
much, that had it not been for the importation, numbers
would have perished.  I myself had scarcely a boll of meal
for every 5 bolls of raw or undried oats.  The bear was
