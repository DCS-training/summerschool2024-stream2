stion.  Every man (it has been observe, who can have a
family, will have one; but a single difficulty may be as effec-
tual as a hundred.  If to what has been already observed,
we add this unquestionable truth, that nine tenths of the
diseases, which afflict the poorer part of the people, are those
of debility, and chiefly arise from cold, it can hardly be won-
dered at, that the above tax has been productive of considerable
discontent, and much emigration.

   Villages.-About 12 or 13 years ago, the village of Dal-
beaty was begun, by Alexander Copland of Kings Grange, and
George Maxwell of Munshes, Esquires, on both sides of a
rivulet, called Dalbeaty Burn.  This village affords one of
the best situations, for a cotton or woollen manufacture, that
could even be wished for.  The gentlemen already mention-
ed feued houses and gardens at a moderate rate; and to every
feuer an allotment was made for perpetuity, in the large
mosses, not far from the village.  The rapidity with which
this village has increased, and the distance from which feuers
have come, plainly demonstrate how much the tax, upon
coals carried coastwise, prevents population in this, and doubt-
less in other parts of Scotland.  In other places of Urr pa-
rish, villages are begun, but they advance slowly; for tim
chief resource they have, as to fuel, is the remainder of the
peats that can be spared by Messrs.  Maxwell and Copland,
after accommodating their own feuers.  This resources must
fail as the village of Dalbeaty enlarges; and already many
farmers, as well as feuers, in the parish, have their peats to
lead from 3 to 5 miles distance.  In one word, it is not chi-
merical to suppose, that, in 10 years, want of fuel might
drive a great proportion of the people in this parish, to Ame-
rica, where indeed a great number of families that emigrated
from hence, are already settled.
