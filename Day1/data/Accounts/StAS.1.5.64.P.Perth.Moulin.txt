   The remainder of the produce is either spun in summer, for
home wear, in the intervals of other labour, or sold to
neighbouring district, less fertile in producing flax.
   The oak woods are valued at L. 4500 at a cutting.  Be-
ing cut once in 20 years, they are worth at the rate of
L. 225 a-year.  The oack bark, by itself, is estimated at
the same price, as the wood is allowed to the merchant
