from the river, stands The Burn House, a neat commodious man-
sion, built by Lord Adam Gordon in 1791, and much improved
by alterations and additions, effected by Messrs Brodie and Shand,
its successive proprietors. The scenery is here very much admired,
particularly along the banks of the river. The walks cut through
the rocks, and the woods planted by his Lordship's directions,
have converted the native ruggedness of these banks into, scenes
of sublimity and beauty.
   Fasque, the only other mansion-house in the parish, is situated
about a mile and a quarter north by west of the village. It was
built by the late Sir Alexander Ramsay of Balmain, Bart. in
1809. It is a large house of a castellated form, and contains
everx `ccommodation for a numerous family. Having been,built
on elevated ground, it commands an extensive, diversified, and
pleasing view of the surrounding country. A lake of about twenty
acres of extent, and a fine approach to the house, completed a
few years ago by the present proprietor, give additional effect to
the scenery of this place.

bot's bill, it was 1794,--in 1811, by the second census, 1562,--
in 1821, 1573,--in 1831, 1637, at present, it is thought to be
considerably more.
   By the last census, the males were 775, and the females, 862,
