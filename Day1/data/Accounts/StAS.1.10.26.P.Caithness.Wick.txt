Probably if the practice of green crops became general, it
would be more beneficial than the ordinary rotation of bear
and oats alternately, which is the practice of Caithness.
Two thirds of the arable land is generally sown with a mix-
ture of black and grey oats, which is found to answer better,
and to yield more plentiful returns, than white oats.  March
and April is the usual seed time for oats, but sometimes they
are sown so late as the beginning of May.  The other part
of the land is laid down in bear, the earliest about the be-
ginning of May, and continuing till the middle of June.
In some places, this article has been sown as late as the 18th
or 20th of June, and yet has produced a plentiful crop,
though of inferior quality.  In warm lying places, bear has
been known to be in the ground only about ten weeks from
the sowing to the reaping time; a proof of very quick vege-
tation.

   Run-rig.-A pernicious custom still too much prevails in
this and other places, of possessing land in what is called rig
and rennal, or run-rig, that is to say, each tenant in a particu-
lar farm or district, has a ridge alternately with his neighbours.
This is necessarily attended with confusion and disputes, and
is a practice requiring to be abolished.  It is thought to have
taken place in times of barbarity, as a preservative against
one neighbour setting fire to the field of another, if inimically
disposed, and to make them all equally anxious to resist the
enemy, in case of invasion*.

are still extant.  At Thrumster there is a ruin of one, fur-
