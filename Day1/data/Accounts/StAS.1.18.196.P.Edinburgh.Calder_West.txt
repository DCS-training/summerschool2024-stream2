   Schools.-The parish school has generally attending it
from 50 to 70 scholars.  Of these, from 6 to 10 are receiv-
ing the rudiments of a classical education.  The school fees,
are 1 shilling per quarter for English, 1 s 6 d for writing, 2 s
for Arithmetic, and 2 s 6 d for Latin.  The school-master's sa-
lary, is L. 5: 5: 7 d 1/2, and he has twenty shillings more yearly,
by a mortification.  But a respectable number of the heritors
have lately agreed to augment the salary, by a voluntary con-
tribution, to continue during their pleasure.  Besides the
established school, there are several others in the parish.
One of these has been lately erected, by one or two of the
small heritors, in opposition to the parish school.  The rest
are occational and ambulatory, consisting of the children of
a dozen or more parents in the same neighbourhood; who,
on account of their distance from the public schools, are com-
pelled to hire a teacher for their own families.

   Antiquities.-Towards the southern extremity of this parish,
there is an old castle, which is reported to have been fortified
by Cromwell, to repress the depredations of the moss troop-
ers.  On the west part of Hayfield estate, there was, a few
years ago, the remains of an old camp, known by the name
of Cromwell-wit.  This is now converted into a corn-field;
and it remains altogether uncertain, whether the name was
given as a mark of Cromwell's understanding in the choice of
the situation, or as a proof of his folly; although the last ap-
pears more probable.
   About two miles due south, there is on the top of a rising
ground called Castle Graig, the remains of a small Roman
camp, in a pretty entire state.  Within a few years, several
Roman coins have been dug up from the environs of this
encampment, on which the Roman eagle was sufficiently ap-
