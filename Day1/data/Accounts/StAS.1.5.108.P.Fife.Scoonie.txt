     Statistical Account

There is scarce any flax raised, excepting what is for pri-
vate use.  The produce of oats, pease and potatoes, is whol-
ly consumed in the parish, and a considerable quantity of
oat meal is brought from the inland parts of the country.
There is no fixed mode of cultivation.  Wheat is sometimes
sown after fallow, drilled beans, potatoes, or grass that has
lain a year or two.  Some fields produce wheat and beans
alternately, and generally yield very good crops.  Every far-
mer raises a considerable quantity of turnips, which are now
employed rather for rearing young beasts, than in feeding cat-
tle for the market.  Since the price of black cattle has been
advanced to such a rate, the farmers have reared a much
larger quantity than formerly.  Such as occupy a farm of
200 acres or so, raise annually 14 or 16 calves, which are
sold at 2, 3, or 4 years old.  Vcal is now become a very
rare article in our markets.
   Within these 20 years, there is a very great alteration in
the mode of plowing.  In place of 4 horses, or 4 and some-
times 6 oxen, yoked in one plough, the land is now ge-
nerally plowed with 2 horses; one man holding the plough
and managing the horses.

   Rent.-The valued rent of the parish is L. 4692, 8 s.
Scotch, and the real rent L. 2000 Sterling.  Land lets at from
L. 1, 10 s. to L. 3 Sterling per acre.  In large farms with
old leases, the rent is from 5 s. to 15 s.  But as the leases ex-
pire, there is always a very considerable rise.  Pasture
grounds let at from L. 1, to L. 1, 10 s. per acre.

   River and Fishing.-The river of Leven, which hath its
source from the lake of that name, runs along the south
side of this parish, from west to east, and take a turn to the
