wall in Orkney, in the month of August, which lasts about
ten days:  To this fair, not only horses from Caithness, but cat-
tle, and all other saleable commodities, are brought from the
different islands in Orkney, the annual business of all ranks
is settled, horses, and such other articles, as country people
require, are purchased and carried home with them to the
islands of their respective habitations.
   The best of the Caithness staigs, or year old horses, have,
for several years past, sold for from 6 L. to 7 L.  The best work
oxen of the Orkney breed, for 4 L., milch cows at 3 L., sheep
at 6 s., swine at 10 s., geese 1 s. 3 d., hens 6 d. each, all Ster-

the amount of what a cottar or bollman, and his wife can earn annually for
the support of themselves and family of young children.  This injudicious
practice, if persisted in, cannot fail of being a mighty discouragement of mar-
riage and of population; but it may be rectified, in a great measure, by the
united exertions of the tenants, or society of farmers in Stronsay, with the
concurrence of the heritors, by adopting the plan explained under the 6th

munity at large, it is presumeable, therefore, that adequate remedies will be
applied, as soon as circumstances will permit the necessary regulations to take
effect.
