to the Baltic, from whence they imported iron, and as the

   The Union with England, in 1707, opened new views
to the traders in Glasgow, having then liberty of a free
commerce to America and the West Indies, which they
had not before.  Immediately, therefore, after this event,
they began to take advantage of it, sending out goods for
