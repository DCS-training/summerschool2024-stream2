leases for 19 years, are improving their fields, trenching in
and clearing barren corners, and building comfortable houses
for themselves.
   `Although my general mode of inclosure is by stone dykes,
I have tried both ditches and hedges.  My ditches I general-
ly make double ones, divided only by a bank of 6 or 8 feet
of solid ground, on which is thrown the earth taken from
both ditches, and on the top I sow whins or plant elder.  I
have sown whin seed on the back of the half dykes, by which
the planted ground is in part inclosed.  Whins thrive there
and every where well, and will be soon both useful and orna-
mental.
   `I have inclosed a kitchen garden at Middletown with
hawthorn; and I have plants raised by myself in readiness
for inclosing some other pieces of ground.  They appear to
thrive well.
   ` In the course of my operations in both farms I have trench-
ed in with pick and spade a great deal of ground which had
never been plowed before.  At the Altens, in particular, I
trenched in about one fourth of an acre behind the house for
a kitchen garden, and found as many stones in it, as inclosed
the garden with walls above six feet high.
   `On the south declivity of Torryhill was a piece of heath
ground, so steep that it did not admit of being ploughed.  I
therefore left it out in inclosing the surrounding fields, and
resolved to make a garden of it, which I have done, and I
have now roses and gilly flowers, and many flowering shrubs,
strawberries, gooseberries, raspberries, and most kinds of gar-
den stuff, with great variety of trees in nursery beds, growing
where heath and whin only grew about three years ago.  The
hanging garden attracts notice, and is an ornament to the
surrounding fields.
