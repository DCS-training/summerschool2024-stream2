   Distilleries and Cattle.-There are two large distilleries in
this place, which feed annually from 170 to 200 cattle.  These,
when fed, are sold at from 10 L. to 15 L. each.  They employ a
great many servants and horses, besides what they hire.
Their spirits go to the Fife, Edinburgh, and Glasgow markets.
They import barley from England, Carse of Gowrie, etc.,
besides what they purchase in the neighbourhood.

   Manufactures.-No manufactures, excepting ship building,
which has been carried on successively for above 50 years past,
have been introduced into Kincardine, until within these two
years, that two companies for tambouring have settled in it,
who employ about 50 girls each, and 18 looms.  The other
mechanics are employed in working to the people of the
parish.

   Houses.-In 1740 there were 224 houses in the parish.  Of
these 51 have been pulled down, and the ground they occu-
