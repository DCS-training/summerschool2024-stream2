oats, grass, etc.  The muirland farms are chiefly for sheep, 
which are thought of a very good kind, and the farmers 
here are particularly attentive to this article, so important 
as a national concern.  The quantity of sheep, horses, cat-
tle, etc. is very variable, many having different farms in 
this and other parishes, on which they do not reside, and
thier mode of stocking of course frequently changing. 

   Church, School, and Poor.-The stipend was augmented
in 1759 to L. 1000 Scotch.  The victual stipend being at 
the ordinary conversion, the heritors willingly consented 
to the augmentation, provided the minister restricted him-
self to the sum.  Mr Hay of Spott is patron, and titular of 
the teinds.  The church and manse were repaired in 1790. 
The parish schoolmaster has L. 100 Scotch, and the other 
usual emoluments.  The average number of scholars is a-
bout 40.  The numbers of poor on the roll amounts to 13. 
They are maintained by the interst of L. 200 Sterling, and 
400 merks Scotch, mortified by Lord Alexander Hay of 
Spott, along with the weekly collections.

*The reason of this great number of baptisms, was that Mr Wood, then 
non-jurant minister at Dunbar, baptised many childeren at Spott.-The num-
ber at present would be greater, but few of the Secedess register their bap-
tisms. 
+Of this number, there may be about one half from other paralies.
