   Character, etc.-We have our good qualities as well as
our bad.  Publicly to expose the one might give offence, and
could do no good.  To praise the other might appear osten-
tation and flattery.  It is, however, but justice to mention,
that the people are sober and industrious, and attached to
the King and Constitution, and to the Presbyterian form of
worship and Church Government.  The men mostly betake
themselves to country work, or to employments connected
with husbandry.  Few of them enlist in the army, and not
many of them engage in the seafaring line.  The women are
thristy and laborious, attentive to their families, and are much
employed in spinning worsted and woolen yarn; particu-

1764, there were only or 10 clocks in the parish, whereas,
at present, there are above 60.

apparent disadvantages, though the writer of this account is
by no means sanguine in his expectation of that effect.

bly subjoined, as probable sources of improvement, and me-
lioration:-1st, If the public school were situated more in the
