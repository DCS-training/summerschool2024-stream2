	Jail--There is a jail in the town, under the government of the
magistrates. But it has, for a long course of years, been in so in-
secure a condition, that none have staid in it but such as were
prisoners de bonne volonte. An act of Parliament, however, has
been obtained for the erection of County Buildings at Lanark,
including a Prison for the Upper Ward; and the foundation stone
was laid on 21st March 1834.
	Fairs.--Seven fairs are held at Lanark every year. The one
on the last Wednesday of May, old style, is for black cattle; that
on the last Wednesday of July for lambs and horses; and the one
in October, on the Friday after thd Falkirk tryst, is for horses and
black-cattle.
	Inns.--There are 53 persons licensed to keep inns in the parish.
Of these, however, 14 are merely spirit-dealers, and do not sell any
kind of liquors but in the way of retail over the counter. The
Clydesdale Hotel in this town is one of the handsomest and best
kept inns in Scotland. A few years ago, the shareholders expend-
ed L. 2400 in adding to it an elegant assembly room.
	FueL.--Fuel is excellent and cheap. Coal is brought from the
adjoining parishes, some of it six, and the rest nine miles distance,
and is laid down in the town at an expense of from 4d to 4 1/2d per
cwt. A few peats are also cast in the adjoining moor.

	April 1834.
