fish. Porridge generally for supper, or potatoes pared, boiled, and
mashed with butter. Scones made from a mixture of oats, pease,
or beans, with wheat or barley, ground fine, and denominated
" mashlum" are in general use, and form a wholesome and palatable food.
        Although the greater part of the manufacturing population have
for some years had to contend with low wages, and often a scanty
supply of work, provisions have been low, and articles of clothing
cheap,--and the majority of the members of families being engaged
in some employment, with industry, temperate habits, and frugal
management, the working classes have been enabled to enjoy a rea-
sonable share of the comforts of society. The great body of the
people may be said to be contented in their circumstances. The
people are in general of an intellectual character. The majority of
them are moral in their habits, and strictly attentive to thier reli-
gious duties.
        Poaching.--A number of years ago, the parish was infested by
a gang of notorious poachers, persons of idle, drunken, disorderly
habits and proflogate manners. These, however, have been broken
up andd dispersed, so that there is not above one or two individuals
at present in the parish addicted to this demoralizing pursuit.
There is still some salmon approaching, although it is decreasing.
Smuggling and pawnbroking are alike unknown in this parish.
        During the last three years there were 21 illegitimate births in
the parish.

The number of imperial acres of land either cultivated or occasionally in til-
lage is,                                                          12,287

then parctised, produced little but weeds; an in order to raise
corn suffiecient for the subsistence of the population, it was neces-
