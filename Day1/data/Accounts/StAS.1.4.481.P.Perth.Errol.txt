     of Errol.

St Madois on the W.  It is 5 1/2 miles in length, and near-
ly 3 in breadth; perfectly regular and compact, and in-
cludes a large and a fair portion of the carse of Gowrie.
From the one end to the other, it stretches over almost the
whole breadth of the carse, from its commencement at the
foot of the hills, to its termination by the Tay; and
though it is in general level ground, there are several e-
minences in it, which add much to the beauty of the fi-
gure.  The soil is of excellent quality.  It varies accord-
ing to the situation.  The low land, which may compre-
hend two-thirds of the parish, is in general a strong clay;
the rising ground, and particularly that in the neighbour-
hood of the village of Errol, is a rich black earth; and
towards the W. end of the parish, the soil is of a lighter
nature, inclining to a brown sand.  The whole country is 
naturally wet, and it is the draining and improving of it
within these last 50 years, which has contributed so much
to its value and fertility.  The climate, of course, could
not be considered as the most desirable.  It was damp,
and attended with such diseases as are common in a heavy
atmosphere.  Some time ago, the ague was a very pre-
valent complaint; it has now in a great measure disap-
peared; but a disease still more fatal seems to have come
in its stead.  Consumptions, which formerly were rare,
have of late been very frequent, although, from the state
of cultivation, it should be thought that the air is much
more falubrious.  But what is remarkable in the carse of
Gowrie, the people who reside in the higher parts of the
country are not found to be the most healthy.  The in-
habitants of the low and marshy grounds, indeed, may be
more liable to rheumatic complaints, but they have been
often observed to enjoy the longest course of life.
