the parishes of Tibbermuir, and Aberdalgie.  On the south,
by the parishes of Forteviot, and Dunbarny.  And on the
south east, by the parish of Rynd.

cient seat of the Earls of Kinnoul.  The castle of Pittheveless,
an ancient seat of the Lords of Oliphant.  Feu-house, a feat

   The old castle which belonged to Ross of Craigie, has long
been demolished; but in the site of it, there is a pleasant and
pretty populous village.  The village of Craigie-mill, where a
great brewerie is established, is also populous.
