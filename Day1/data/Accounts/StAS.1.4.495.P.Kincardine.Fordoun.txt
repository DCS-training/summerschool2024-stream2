north side of the parish is hilly and mountainous, the soil
light and shallow, and not so fertile as the other.  In the
plain, the air is moist; towards the hills, dry.  The most
prevailing diseases are agues and fevers; but, as within
these few years much of the stagnated water has been
drawn off, and the lands drained, these diseases are not so
frequent as formerly.  There are several mineral springs,
but none of any considerable reputation.  They are some-
times drank by those in the neighbourhood, who are af-
fected by stomach or gravelish complaints.  The most re-
markable mountains are the Grampian Hills, which bound
the parish to the N. and run through the island, from A-
berdeen to Dumbarton.  They are covered with heath
and rock.  There are some quarries of freestone, used for
building.

     Population, etc.-According to Dr Webster's return the
numbers were 1890.  In the year 1771 there were about 2400
people in the parish; now (1790,) there are onley 2258; of
these are about 1158 males, and 1100 females.  The annual
average of births is from 70 to 80; of deaths from 60 to
70; of marriages from 16 to 20.  There are 267 below  7
years of age, and 1991 above that age.  There have been
some few instances of persons who have reached the age of
90, and 1 or 2 who have exceeded 100.  Of the Established
Church are 2001; Episcopals, 106; Seceders, 151.  The
cause of depopulation seems to be the union of farms.  The
number of inhabited houses is about 470; 5 persons at an
average to each.  There are several villages in the parish.
That of Auchinblay contains about 100 persons, and there
is a weekly fair in it chiesly for cattle, from Michaelmas to
Christmas.  The village of Kincardine, in the west end of
the parish, contains about 70 persons.  From this village the
