                        ON THE COUNTY OF INVERNESS.
INVERNESS-SHIRE is one of the largest counties of Scotland,
extending, from nortb-east to south-west, 85 miles, and from
north-west to south-east, about 55 miles.
   It is bounded on the south, by Aroyleshire ; on the north, by
Ross-shire ; on the cast, by Banff and Aberdeenshires; and ex-
tends on the west to the Atlantic Ocean, including, in this direc-
tion, several of the Western Islands. The whole area of the
county is computed at 4600 square miles, or 2,944,000 acre,
500,000 of which are under cultivation. A chain of salt and
fresh-water lochs, in the line of the Caledonian Canal intersects
the county from south to nortb, forming Glen More, or the Great
Glen of Scotland ; and the river Ness, rising Out Of the loch of
the same name, and, after traversing a very short space of country,
empties its waters into the Moray Fritb. The greater part of the
countv is extremely mountainous, consisting of heath and pasture
land; the fertile and arable portions being in the glens and valleys.
The county is naturally portioned out into several of these glens
or districts; such as Lochaber, on the south, adoining Argyleshire;
Glen Garry, Glen Morriston, Glen Urquhart, Gleneig, to the west-
ward of the Caledonian Canal; Arisaig, Moydart, and Stratbglass,
to the north ; and on the east, Glen Roy, Badenocb, and the
valley of the Spev. Most of these valleys and districts are watered
by their respective streams.
   The extensive Island of Skye, the Harris, Benbecula, North
and South Uist, Barra, part of Lewis, and some other small islands
are included in this county.
   The principal inland lochs are, Loch Ness, Loeb Oich, Loch
Lochy, Loch Arkig, Loch Laggan.
