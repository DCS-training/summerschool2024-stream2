of grain and roots.  Flax is raised only in small quantities,
and for family use.  Oats, barley, peas, potatoes, and
turnips, are the chief articles of crop.  All sorts of garden
stuff for the kitchen are produced in abundance.  Agricul-
ture has certainly arrived at a considerable state of im-
provement, yet little wheat is sown.  There are some
ploughs sitted up with wheels in the English fashion.  But,
in general, they are of the construction common throughout
Scotland, with iron heads, and the boards upon both sides
covered with plates of iron.  The inconvenient ploughs,
with clumsy timber heads and rough unshod boards, which
were formerly used here, are now entirely laid aside.  The
number of ploughs employed in the parish are about 60.
There are between 70 and 80 carts, and 2 post chaises.
The number of black cattle is supposed to be about
1000; and that of the horses 200.  These, and a few sheep,
are the chief domestic animals.-Seed-time usually com-
mences about the middle of March; harvest in the begin-
ning of September.  The parish annually supplies the neigh-
bouring towns of Stonehaven, Montrose, and Brechin, with
large quantities of meal, barley, etc.-The price of provi-
sions has been increased to nearly double within these 20
years.  Beef, mutton, and veal, are now sold at 4d. a-
pound, and every other article of provision in the same
proportion.-Labourers in husbandry earn from 9d. to 1s.
a-day; masons and joiners from 15d. to 20d.; tailors some-

ster's hourse, are from L. 6 to L. 7 a-year; of a female ser-
vant from L. 3 to L. 4.

   Rent.-Houses are let at from 6 to 7 per cent. on the
rate at which they are built.  The best arable land is ren-
ted at a guinea an acre, byt sometimes higher.  The best pas-
ture ground at L. 2, 10s.  Land of an inferior quality at
