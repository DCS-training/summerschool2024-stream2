accommodated there.  Some of the fires being neglected,
had, before the discovery was made, communicated with
the roof.  This being of lead, poured itself down in all
directions, so as to preclude any attempts to save it.  The
burning of the palace happened the same day that the
church of St. Ninians was blown up.  The explosion of
the latter was sensibly felt here, and gave rise to various
conjectures, till intelligence of the real cause was received.
   The Duke of Hamilton is now honorary keeper of the
palace.  The emoluments connected with that office are
enjoyed by an English gentleman of the name of Carter.

   Church.-This building unites elegance with strength,
and may be regarded as a complete specimen of Gothic
architecture.  Its length from E. to W. is 182 feet.  The
breadth, including the ailes, 100.  The height about 90
feet.  The time of its erection cannot be ascertained.  It
may probably be referred to David I., who distinguished
himself so signally by structures of that kind.
   The steeple is adorned with an imperial crown, which
has a fine effect from whatever point it is viewed.  The
out side of the church was adorned with several statues,
and the niches remain; but, in the height of antipapal
zeal, all the figures were demolished, except that of Mi-
chael, which escaped probably from its being placed higher
than the rest, rather than respect to him as the tutelary
angel.  That he was reputed so, appears from the stately
church dedicated to him, from one of the wells, which
bears his name, and the town arms, which exhibit him
with this inscription: Vis Michaelis collocet nos in coelis.
But whatever the people here might, in ignorant times,
attribute to his influence, it may be presumed they now
build their hopes of admission to heaven on a surer basis.
