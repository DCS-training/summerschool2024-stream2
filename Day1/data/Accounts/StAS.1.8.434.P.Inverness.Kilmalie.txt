     Statistical Account

The number of members of the Established Church, is 3715,
-of Papists, 103,-and of Nonjurors, 407.  It is not long,
since the number of Papists amounted only to 35.  The in-
crease is owing to their flocking into Maryburgh, from the
neighbouring countries, when dispossessed of their lands.-
Until the year 1779, the living was worth no more than 52 L.
10 s.  Sterling annually; neither was there any allowance made
for communion elements; and even yet, it is only 69 L. 10 s.,
and 3 L. 6 s. 8 d. for communion elements.  There is no manse.
The heritors allow, in place thereof, and for deficiency of
glebe, the sum of 11 L. 13 s. 4 d.  An excellent parish church
was built, in the year 1783, which cost; 440 L.; and, last year,
another was built, in Maryburgh, by the Duke of Gordon
and the inhabitants, that cost somewhat more.  The Duke of
Argyll has always been reckoned the patron of the parish;
but, it is said, that he has made over his right of patronage to
Locheile, with whom the Duke of Gordon disputes it.  Prin-
cipal Campbell, of the University of Glasgow, was predeces-
sor to the present incumbent.

   Schools.-The parochial school is at Fort-William; which, if
not the most centrical place, is at least the most populous in the
parish.  Here, the languages and mathematics are taught.  The
number of the scholars, attending, is about 150.  The salary is
16 L. 13 s. 4 d.; which, with the school fees, session-clerk's sa-
lary, and the dues for christenings and marriages, will be equal
to about 90 L., or 100 L.  Sterling annually.  Besides this school,
there are 5 others, on the establishment of the Society for pro-
pagating Christian Knowledge.  To one of there, they grant
a salary of 22 L, and to rest 12 L. each.  There is also a
catechist, employed between this and Kilmanivaig parish, with
a salary of 12 L.  Sterling.
