     of Criech.

parish stretch far into the hills and moors, lying between Criech
and the parish of Eddrachylis, and may be reckoned upwards
of 40 measured miles.  The breadth of the parish is very un-
equal.  In some places it is but 2 miles broad:  in some 5,
and in the top of the parish, it may be from 5 to 10 miles
broad, and upwards.  The parish of Criech lies on the N.
of the Kyle or Frith of Tain, and the river Ockel.  The
Kyle slows about 11 miles above the church of Criech:  The
river Ockel, discharging itself into the Kyle, separates it from
the parish of Kincardine for 10 miles.  The parish of Criech
lies opposite to the parish of Kineardine, but stretches about
six miles farther eastward, opposite to the parish of Edder-
town, separated from there parishes by the Kyle and the river
Ockel.  Its length may be seen to be very great, from exa-
mining any common map of Scotland.

   Soil.-The soil of the parish is light and thin, except in the
E. end of it, where there is deep loam; and some meadows on
the Kyle, and the tides of rivers in the top of it, The arable land
mostly lies on the Kyle side, on a hard gravel.  In many places
the gravel, when dug and mixed with dung, proves excellent
manure.  As the soil is thin, and lies exposed to the south,
the barvest is in general very early, much more so, than in
the low country, or in places farther to the south.  There are
hills and moors back from the Kyle, where the tenant's cattle
are pastured in summer.  The hills, for the most part, are
covered with heath, with many interjacent spots of green
grass, especially near small rivulets.  The face of the parish
is hilly.  Perhaps, not a thirtieth part of the parish is culti-
vated.

   Climate and Distempers.-The climate is very various.  In
the east end of the parish, it is as temperate as on the coast of
Suthertarrd.  While the weather is dry and good in the east
