   Pasturage, Sheep, etc.-From a survey of the above tables
it appears, that there are only about 711 acres of the parish
of Denino under real crops.  There are fully 180 acres of
perfect moor in it, of no use, unless perhaps for planting, of
which it is hitherto destitute.  The parish is, however, adorn-

scribed ed for cherishing the cold grounds, where they flourish in
beautiful and plentiful variety.  There are, in the last place,
generally about 40 acres of fallow in the parish; so that, if
from 2280 acres, which the whole district of Denino contains,
we deduct 991, the number under corn, fallow, ect. there
will appear a balance of 1289 acres of natural and artificial
pasturage; upon the last division of which, great numbers of
excellent cattle are fed, during the summer, by the graziers
and either occasionally disposed of, to the itinerant merchant,
or driven to the country markets.  The number of sheep in
the parish does not exceed 20; they are kept and fed by some
of the farmers, for their own use only, during the summer.

table of the annual produce, it appears, that the parish must
do considerably more than maintain its inhabitants.  The ave-
rage prices of the several species of grain, therein specified,
