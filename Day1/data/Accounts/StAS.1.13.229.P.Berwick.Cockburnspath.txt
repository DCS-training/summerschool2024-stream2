skate, whitings, flouders, lobsters, and crabs, etc.  Had-
docks, which for some years had disappeared, have this
spring been again found in considerable quantities, but the
price is greatly advanced.  For may years, the best had-
docks were sold at 6 d. the score, and now they fell at from
2 s. to 5 s.  The herring-fishing is sometimes very advan-
tageous; in some seasons, above 100 boats have been col-
lected at the Cove, and been very successful.  The white
fish is in general sold to carriers, who take them to Mus-
selburgh, from whence they are carried on women's backs
to the Edinburgh market.  The lobsters have, for these
many years, been fold by contract, at a fixed price for cer-
tain sizes, to Mr Fall of Dunbar, who shipped them off to
London.  About 40 years ago, an attempt was made by
Sir John Hall of Dunglass, to clear a bason, and make a
harbour at the Cove.  The wall was confiderably advan-
ced, when a strong wind from the N. E. raised such a
heavy sea, as almost entirely destroyed the work, and it
was not again renewed.  A road had been cut through a
rock, for an easy access to the shore, by which carts still
pass under ground, about 60 yards.  Cellars were also cut
out of the solid rock, and would have been very useful and
commodious.

   Roads.-This parish has the peculiar advantage of being
intersected by public roads, which afford easy and conve-
nient communications to all quarters.  The great eastern
road from Edinburgh to London by Berwick, passes
through the parish, cutting it nearly from S.E. to N.W.;

south; and a new road is lately begun, but not yet open-
ed, by which it is proposed to form an easy and short
communication between East Lothian and Berwickshire,
along a valley, which passes near Renton, in the parish of
