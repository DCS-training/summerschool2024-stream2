the weeds appear again, never fails to produce a good crop.
But what is also of great advantagte, it leaves the ground
cleaner and mellower, and in a fitter condition for wheat,
or any other crop, than a complete fallow.  Those who
grudge the few seeds, that may be turned up by the plough
or the harrow, have only to cause a boy replace the plants,
on the face of the furrow, where it may be necessary.
   A considerable quantity of grain, of different kinds, has
been annually exported from Moray in general, principally
from the ports of Findhorn, Lossiemouth, and Germach, to
London, Leith, and the mouth of the canal at Carron.  Last
year, above 10,000 bolls were shipped from those ports.
This is almost the first export in any quantity, since 1783,
when by the failure of the crop in 1782, about 100,000
bolls of corn and meal were imported to both sides of the
Moray frith.
   The whole low part of the county of Moray is fruitful
in corn, and the parish of Elgyn, among the rest.  Besides
what is exported by sea, and sent to the Highlands, the
licensed stills in the county, consume a great quantity.
There are 19 of these stills, measuring in all 635 gallons,
which, by law, are intitled to distill 3863 bolls of bear an-
nually, and a brewery, established of late in this town,
malts above 1500 bolls.  Were the smuggling of foreign
spirits into this country effectually suppressed, the exporta-
tion of corn would probably greatly diminish, if no total-
ly cease.
   Many years ago, the land was tilled by 6, 8, or 10 oxen,
in a plough, and sometimes by 2 or 4 oxen, with 1 or 2
horses.  The late Sir Robert Gordon, of Gordonstown,
about 30 years ago, introduced the practice of plowing with
only two horses, managed by reins, without a driver.  This
