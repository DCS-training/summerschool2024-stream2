     NUMBER XVII.

     (COUNTY OF BANFF, SYNOD OF MORAY, PRESBYTERY
     OF STRATHBOGIE).

     By the Rev. Mr James Simmie.

     Situation, etc.

   The parish of Rothiemay is bounded, on the E. and
N. E. by the parish of Marnoch; on the S. and S. E.
by Inverkeithnie, Forgue, and Huntly; on the W. and
S. W. by Cairny; on the N. and N. W. by Grange.  Its
greatest length is from 7 to 8 miles; its greatest breadth
from 5 to 6.
   The northern part of this parish is inferior to the rest,
both in fertility and beauty.  Beside some hilly ground,
and some plantations of fir, it consists of a large plain, con-
taining partly arable, partly pasture-ground, and an exten-
sive moss that supplies with fuel, not only the parishioners,
