grain is ripe sooner than the other.  In defence of this
custom it is alleged, that if, owing to the weather, one of
the kinds fail, the other will be tolerably good.  Every ex-

inclusive.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants in the year
1755, by Dr Webster's account, was 993.  At present, it

   Church, School.-The parish kirk is in good repair; the

of which, in every point of view, much accords with the
