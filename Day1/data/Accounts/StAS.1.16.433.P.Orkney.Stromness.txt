     of Sandwick and Stromness.

   The great disproportion of males to females in the vil-
lage of Stromness, is occasioned by the young men going
abroad to various parts of,the world; to the Greenland
fishery, the coal-trade, Hudson's Bay, and many are to be
found in his Majesty's navy.

   Baptisms and Marriages.-To evade the fees to session-
clerk and officer, and also the late tax upon registration, or
through mere inattention, many parents neglect to have
their childrens names inferred in the parish-register of
births.  The number of burials cannot be ascertained, as
there are no dues to the session-clerk therefrom, and conse-
quently no regular account has been kept.  The baptisms
and marriages recorded for 3 years are as follow:
