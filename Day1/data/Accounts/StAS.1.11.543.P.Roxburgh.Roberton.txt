   School.-A new school-house was built in 1790.  The
schoolmaster has the ordinary legal salary, some perquisites as
session-clerk and precentor, and a small fee from the heritors,
for uplifting and distributing the poor's money.  Till some-
thing be done by the public to render country schoolmasters
more comfortable and independent, the important office which
they bear, cannot be filled by men of education, of talents,
and consequence enough to benefit society, as they, with some
encouragement, might do.

   Poor.-The average number of poor on the roll, young
and old, may be about 32.  They are supplied by collections
made in the kirk and quarterly assessments.  A sum is always
kept in hand for occasional supplies; and, if such fund should
fail, the minister has hitherto had the approbation of the he-
ritors for taking credit, till such fund be replaced by the col-
lections, or by a new assessment.  The expence of their main-
tainance for the current year is 124 L.

Population.-The return to Dr. Webster, in 1755,
   was                                                 651
The number of inhabitants, of all ages, in 1791, and
   1792, was                                           629

<FOOTNOTE>

*Formerly there were several hamlets, of which no vestiges now remain.
The greatest collection of families, in one place, does not exceed 5 or 6.  There
is no village, and no licensed retailer of spirits in the parish.  The expence of
rearing houses is the great obstacle to population, and appears to be one cause
also of the advanced price of labour.  Cottages that fall down are seldom
rebuilt.
