   Fishery.-About the year 1722, JOHNSHAVEN seems to
have ranked among the first fishing towns in Scotland; 26
boats were then employed in the fishery, 13 of which car-
ried each from 8 to 10 tons burden, the other 13, from 5 to
6 tons.  A large boat's crew, including one or two boys, ge-
nerally consisted of 10, a small boat's, 8.  Three of the crew
were called skippers, who had a share in the boat, kept her in
repair, and became bound to indemnisy the proprietor of the
town for the sum of 100++ merks Scotch, which he advanced
to assist in building the boat; and also to pay a yearly rent of 2 L.
10 s. Sterling.  To defray this expence, the skippers were en-
titled to every fifth fish taken, besides their own deal or share.
large boats were employed from the beginning of May till
the first of August, in catching cod, ling, etc. or in what is
called the out sea fishing, from the fishing ground lying at the
distance of 40 or 50 miles from shore.  In favourable wea-
ther, they generally continued one, two, or three nights at
sea.  During the months of August and September, they
brought a sufficient quantity of coals and peats from the
Frith of Forth to supply the neighbourhood through the
season: after which these large boats were laid up for win-
ter.  The small boats were then employed in catching had-
docks, whitings, etc. till the end of February, when the
near great fishing, about 8 or 10 miles from land, commen-
ced.  In this they were engaged, always leaving their lines
at sea one night or more, according to the weather, till the
beginning of May, when the large boats were again launch-
ed into the deep.  The great fish were purchased by Mon-
trose merchants, salted and sent up the Mediterranean.  The
