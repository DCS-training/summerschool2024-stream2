In that year Dundee,was taken by the English, and a detachment 
ê3Åê3
äwas sent to Forfar, who broke open the prison, pillaged the town,
and burned all its charters and records. In 1665, a charter of
novodamus was granted by Charles II. And honourable mention
is made, in enumerating the privileges conferred on the burgh, of
the conduct of Provost Strang in protesting in Parliament, in 1647,
against the delivery of the King's person to the English. The
records of the town-council, which are preserved, begin with the
year 1660.

Lower. It was built by one of the Earls of Northesk; and the
present family of Carnegie of Lower and Turin are descendants
from him.

In 1717, registers of both descriptions just noticed are begun, and
continued to the present time.
	Public Buildings.--There is a town and county-hall situated in
the centre of the town, and in the same building, for the present,
is the jail for both civil and criminal prisoners, which has been
declared wholly inadequate and unsuitable for carrying into opera-
tion the new system of prison discipline. Not many years ago,
the proprietor's in the county applied for and obtained an act of
Parliament for erecting a sheriff-court-house, sheriff clerk's of-
fices, record and jury-rooms, &c. which were erected at an expense
of nearly 1:5000. They are commodious and handsome. They
are situated in the centre of the town. Ground has been purchased
for the erection of a new prison, a little to the north of the town,
on the property belonging to the burgh, and the work is com-
menced.
