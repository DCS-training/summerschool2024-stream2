where there is generally a market for grain, victual, etc.
when it is plenty; and in the neighbourhood of the fertile
countries of Boyn, Enzie and Moray, from whence, and
by importation, a supply can be obtained in wet and late
seasons, when the crop fails in Stryla; and that it possesses
the means of improvement by lime, so near, and in such
plenty.  But the disadvantages are many; a cold, wet,
and late soil and climate, and consequently uncertain crops;
short leases; no encouragement to tenants to improve
their land, to inclose or build good houses; heavy and op-
pressive mill-multures, which take between an eighth and
a ninth of all that the tenant carries to the mill, and even
of what he buys, in times of scarcity, if it be manufactured
within the sucken.  The tenant also is obliged to pay 10 d.
for every boll of oats carried to the shore, and sold some-
times as low as 7 s. and never above 12 s. the boll, and e-
very farm pays a certain number of bolls of barley, for
what barley is sold, and for keeping in the mill-water;
notwithstanding which, the tenants are compelled to per-
sonal service, for keeping in the mill-water, and to per-

and upholding the mill, if required so to do; and to carry
the mill farm-meal to Macduff, 17 miles distant, which
they are generally called to do in the spring season.  This
servitude amounts almost to a prohibition to improve, as
it is at least a tax of 12 per cent. upon the produce of im-
provements; besides, the tenants are liable to be called to
give an account upon oath, before the baron-bailie, what
they have bought or sold for three years back; and if a
man's memory, who cannot keep accounts, has failed him,
and he conscientiously refuses to take an oath, he is char-
ged arbitrarily.  Such a mode of proceeding is surely con-
trary to the essential principles of justice, and very hurtful
to morals, as frequent oaths, (especially where the interest
