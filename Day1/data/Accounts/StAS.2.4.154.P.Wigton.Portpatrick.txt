	"Portpatrick, " says Chalmers, (Caledonia, Vol, iii. p. 409,)
   "Owes its increase to its having become the port of communica-
tion with Ireland. It was only in 1662 that a regular post was
established between Scotland NAd Ireland through Portpatrick;
and then only once a week. Formerly the harbour at Portpatrick,
in its natural state, was a mere inlet between two ridges of rocks
that advanced into the sea; and as there is a prodigious swell
from the west, upon the mouth of this creek, without any elbow
to protect a vessel, it was then only practicable for small flat-bot-
tomed vessel to navigate here; and it was necessary for every one
that arrived to take the ground; and all the people nf the place
collected and drew thd vessel on the beach, out of the influenced
of the waves. In order to remedy this inconvenience, a very fine
pier was built; but this having also been found insufficient, a pro-
ject is now in opdration, under the authority of Parliament, (1820,)
for very greatly improving the harbour of Portpatrick; so as to
afford perfect security and the convenience at this frequented passage.
There is a reflecting light-house at Portpatrick, and another a
Donaghadee on the Irish side, both which were built before 1790.
Portpatrick forms one of the creeks of the port of Stranraer."
   The "project" referred to in the above extract began to be
executed in March 1821, under the superitendence of a board
of commissioners apointed by act of Parliament, and consisting
chiefly of gentlemen belonging to the neighbouring district. A
harbour greatly more extensive than the former, and comprehend-
