bottoms of the valleys of Glenlochy and Glendochart, which
are subject to the overflowings of the rivers of Lochy and
Dochart running through them.  These rivers, being sud-
denly swelled by the rains, descend frequently with consi-
derable impetuosity, overflowing their banks, to the no small
prejudice of the fields and meadows which lie along the sides
of them.  The surface of the ground in the parish is gene-
rally unequal  The bottoms of the valleys are mostly level,
consisting chiefly of meadows and arable ground.  The hills
rise with a gentle slope, and are cultivated and inhabited in
many parts a good way up.  They rise, in many places, to a
considerable height, and carry rich grass to the very top.  In
the higher parts of them, it is generally interspersed with
pretty rank heath, which the shepherds of late years have
been at pains in burning, and the sheep, since the more ge-
neral introduction of them into the country, contribute to
keep under.

   Lakes and Rivers.-Loch-Tay, by the side of which a great
part of the parish of Killin lies, is the only remarkable lake
in the country.  It is a fresh water lake, 15 English miles in
length, and reckoned about a mile in breadth.  It lies from
west to east, and out of it the river Tffues. There is
another lake at the west end of Glendochart, called Loch-
dochart.  It lies also from west to east, is about 3 miles in
length, and forms the boundary betwixt Strathfillan and Glen-
dochurt.  The river of Fallen fals into the west end of it,
after running for 3 miles through Strathfillan, and the river
of Dochart issues out of it, which runs for 8 miles through
Glendochart, before it joins the Lochy and enters into
Loch-Tay.  The river of Lochy, runs for about 10 miles
through Glenlochy, and these rivers of Lochy and Do-
chart evidently give their names to each of the valleys
