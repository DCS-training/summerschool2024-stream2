     Statistical Account

portioning of custom-house fees, and the shortening of de-
lays incident or usual there, will then be objects of corre-
spondent magnitude.  But the STATISTICAL ACCOUNT is
not meant as a magazine of grievances.  May providence
avert greater than we have felt, perhaps khan we have ima-
gined!

   The author of this article, having thus noticed every thing
in the parish, where he does his duty, that he conceives help-
ful to public utility, and connected with the patriotic work
he would wish to support, claims from the reader that in-
dulgence, in respect of literary endowment, which may well
be looked for, by one who appears in print, from no view of
profit or of praise, but (like many reverend gentlemen) from
compulsion.  Minus aptus acutis naribus-If it is now ac-
cepted, he hopes it may be a while before he has occasion to
repeat the above apology.  Devoid of those brilliant talents,
and ill supported by that profound erudition, which Doctors,
Chaplains, and Almoners only possess, the humble parson of
Buittle doubts if he has persuaded the world, that in his
humble parish, "all is for the best."-Happy should he be, in
believing, that the sense of the public admitted things to be
tolerable.
