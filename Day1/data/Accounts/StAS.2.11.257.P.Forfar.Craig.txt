    Manufactures.--In the manufacturing line, there is nothing car-
ried on here to any great extent. The reason may be, that the
great object of pursuit in this district is agriculture; and that the
situation of the parish, much elevated and remote from rivers, does
not furnish the water that would be requisite for extensive bleach-
fields, and for the operation of mills." There are, however, thirty-
six males employed in manufacture in the parish.
    Several years ago, small quantities of kelp were manufactured on
the coast, but the process has for some time past been entirely dis-
continued.
    Navigation.--Several inhabitants of the parish are joint proprie-
tors of ships sailing from the port of Montrose, but there are no
vessels which can be said to belong to the place. Many of the re-
sidents in Ferryden and its vicinity are employed as seamen in na-
vigating the Montrore shipping, and especially in the vessels en-
gaged in the north-sea whale-fishing. Recently, however, the
greater proportion of the crews of the whalers are taken on board
from Shetland, where the hands required are easily procured at lower
wages; but our fishermen are ready to ascribe to this plan the di-
minished success of the whale ships from this quarter, in conse-
quence of the inferiority, as they allege, of the Shetlanders to our
fishers, as vigorous and adventurous boatmen.
    The only navigable river is the South Esk, which separates the
parish from the town and harbour of Montrose.
				V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
    The nearest market-town is Montrose, which is separated from
the northern boundary of the parish only by the river South Esk,
and to which there is access by a magnificent suspension bridge.
    Means of Communication.--The means of communication are,

<FOOTNOTE>The value of the grain is estimated at the average prices for the years 1830,
1831, 1832.
          About fifteen years ago considerable quantities of flax were raised on almost
every farm in the parish; but for several years past none has been sown.
