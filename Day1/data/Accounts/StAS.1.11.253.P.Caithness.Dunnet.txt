handed wheels, and are making astonishing progress with
them.

   Agriculture.-It is supposed, that there are about 1600 acre
in cultivation in the parish.  The only grain cultivated is
oats and bear, with a very small quantity of pease.  Of late,
however, considerable quantities of potatoes have been raised,
particularly in the farm of Dunnet, where the soil is well
adapted to that root, the benefit of which was much felt in
the late bad years.  Small quantities of lint are raised also in
different parts.  The quantity of grain raised is sufficient to
support the inhabitants, and admit of an export of about 500
bolls of bear, and the same quantity of oatmeal, per annum.
Of the householders, 194 occupy small farms.  Most of these
have one plough, and a few of them two; but the farms of
some are so small, that two or three of them unite in furnish-
ing cattle, to labour their joint possessions.  There are 190
ploughs in the parish, besides 14 on 4 farms laboured by the
proprietors*.  The tenants ploughs are generally drawn by
4 horses, or oxen, yoked a breast.  That practice appears
ridiculous to strangers: But a better acquaintance with the
people's circumstances would lead to a more favourable opi-
nion.  The cattle are very small and ill fed; and hence their
strength is not sufficient for drawing a plough, if they were
yoked in any manner, where part might have an opportunity
of throwing the whole burden occasionally upon the rest.  This
practice, however, is attended with the inconveniency, that
one of the cattle must walk on the plowed ground.  Of this

*These 4 farms contain about 220 acres; which, being taken from the
above 1600 acres, the remaining 1380, laboured by 190 ploughs, is about 7 1/4
acres per plough, on an average.
