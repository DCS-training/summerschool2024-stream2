ing in with this method, there is now very little bear raised
for the market, but only a small quantity for family use.  In-
deed, oats is the crop most to be depended on by the farmer,
as being a more hardy grain than bear, a more certain crop,
and always commanding a ready market.  Pease are seldom
sown.  Though luxuriant crops of them can be raised, yet the
rains that generally fall about the autumnal equinox, lays
them flat with the ground, to the loss of both grain and fod.
der.  Beans are sown by many farmers, only in small quan-
tities.  From the grounds along the water, large crops are
got.  Wheat is not sown by the common farmers, though
some gentlemen in the parish sow it in small quantities for fa-
mily use, and have returns from 30 to 40 Winchester bushels
the acre.  It is sown after a fallow or potatoe crop, and the
seed generally ploughed down with a shallow furrow, and
lightly harrowed.  This method is preferred, as hereby the
seed being deeper buried, winter or spring frosts, are not so
ready to throw out the plants; and it is also thought, that if
the crop is luxuriant, by having a deep hold of the ground,
it is not so apt to lodge.  Clover-seeds are but seldom sown.
A few who sow them, after proper preparation, have found
great profit from them, both in enriching their hay crops,
and adding greatly to the value of pasture-grass.  It can
scarcely be told, to what extent, an acre of good red clover
will go, in feeding cows and horses in the house, when 2 or
3 crops are taken from it.  There is surely no such cheap
way of feeding horses in summer, and having plenty of milk
from cows, as by allowing them red clover in abundance, not
to mention the dung that is hereby saved.  But, till cleansing
the ground from weeds by fallowing, be more frequent than
it is, little advantage will be gained by sowing of clover-
seeds.  Fallowing is not practised in this parish by common
farmers, but by a few gentlemen it is going on, and whether
