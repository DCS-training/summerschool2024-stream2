of the plant being exposed, receives its proper nourishment.
in Nevay, rows of trees are planted in the hedges, which
embellish the country, but eventually must be prejudi-
cial to the thorns, and the adjoining part of the fields.

   Manures.-Beside the dung of the farm-yards, and com-
post, consisting of weeds, ditch-scourings, ruins of mud-
walls, etc. considerable quantities of marl are used.  This
excellent manure, whose qualities and operation are now
well understood, is fetched from the mosses of Baikie and
Meigle.  The originaI price is 8 d. per boll, containing 8
solid feet.  Sixty bolls are allowed to an acre; but, by many
experiments formerly made in the parish of Bendochy, it
appears that a larger proportion will not injure the soil, if
it be not overcropped.  Marl incorporated with compost an-
swers better than when mixed with farm-yard dung.  It is
usually spread on the surface of fallow, or on grass, some
time before a field is broken up.

   Live Stock.-Little attention is paid to the different
breeds of animals.  141 horses are used for the purposes of
husbandry; but most of these are purchased from distant
counties.  No black cattle are employed, though a few are
reared.  Sheep are entirely banished.

   Mines, etc.-Near Castletown there is one mineral
spring, and another on Sidla, a mile southward of Essie;
but their qualities and virtues are unknown.  A small vein
of silver ore, too inconsiderable to he wrought, was disco-
vered several years ago in the south-east corner of the pa-
rish.  An excellent freestone quarry, in the parish of Ne-
vay, at the foot of Sidla, has been lately neglected.  The
stone is of a light grey colour, and admits of a fine polish.
