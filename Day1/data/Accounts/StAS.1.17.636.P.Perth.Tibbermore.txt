lately introduced, has obtained a decided preference, and is
now almost universally in use*.
   Upon the wet grounds, the seed time is often retarded by
rains.  In the year 1793, many of the farmers had it not in
their power to begin the lowing of oats till the month of
May; but this year, viz. 1796, some oats have been fown in
the first week of March-the one the latest, and the other
perhaps the earliest seed time that is remebered.  In ordi-
nary seasons, the sowing of oats is begun in the first week of
April, barley in the first week of May, and wheat about the
middle of September.  The improvement of the soil, and
the practice of a more regular husbandry, have rendered our
harvest season somewhat earlier than formerly.  It is com-
mon to begin cutting wheat about the end of August; bar-
ley in the beginning of September; and the other corn in
course, without intermitting the harvest work.  The average
crop of oats upon a Scotch acre is 5 bolls; of barley 7; of
wheat 9, all Linlithgow measure.  About 1 boll and 2 pecks
of oats produce a boll of meal.  The average price of oat
meal, barley, and pease is 15 s. for the boll; of wheat, one
guinea+.
   Nearly all the farms are inclosed and subdivided with
ditches and hawthern hedges, but all the inclosures of this
kind are hitherto insufficient; and this, it is believed, must
continue to be the case, till much more effectual means be
employed for protecting and rearing the young hedges, and
especially for saving their shoots from being croped by the

plough.

+These may perhaps be accounted the average prices, with-
out making allowance for the extraordinary prices of crops
1794 and 1795.
