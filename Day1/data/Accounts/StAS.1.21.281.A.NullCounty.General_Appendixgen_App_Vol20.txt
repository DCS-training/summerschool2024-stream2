rent of the country: and this difference must be ascribed to
the patriotic and benevolent exertions of Sir John Sinclair.
   There are two very necessary bridges in these parishes;
one over a water that runs into Laxforth Voe, and the other
where the Loch of Strome communicates with the Voe of
Binnaness.  These bridges are at present in very bad order.
To open a more tally communication with the town of Ler-
wick, Mr Ross of Sound, aided and supported by Mr Scott
of Scottshall, the sheriff-substitute, has done a great deal to
make a good and commodious road.  This, over mountains
and vallies of the deepest moss, was at first thought imprac-
ticable, and every obstruction was thrown in his way; but,
in spite of difficulties and discouragement, he persevered, un-
til he had formed a road about 16 feet in breadth, and ex-
tending from the parish of Tingwall to Lerwick.  He is now
covering it with clay and gravel; and so much of it as is thus
covered, looks well, and promises duration.
   The remains of antiquity in these parishes are hardly worth
notice.  At Scaloway there is an old ruinous castle, built in
1600 by Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney; and in some other
places, the ruins of Pictish casttes, and Popish chapels, are to
be met with.
   The minister's glebe is on a rising ground, at the north
end of the loch of Tingwall, three miles north from Scallo-
way, and two south from Laxforth Voe, and in sight from
both.  The manse and kirk stand on the highest part of this
rising ground.  The kirk was built in 1788, and the manse
in 1795; and both are in good order.  The soil of the glebe
is excellent; and its being so remote from the sea, renders
it the most proper spot in this country for experiments in
agriculture: but the want of inclosures, in a country where
there are no herds, and where, the herding act has hardly
been heard of, must operate powerfully against all agricul-
