turnips or potatoes, have got no footing yet but among gen-
tlemen-farmers.

   Implements of Husbandry.-All the implements of or-
dinary husbandry, are now made more substantial and com-
modious than formerly.  Box-carts are coming in use for
kellochs, and single draughts are preferred to double, which
ill suit the strength of our small horses.

   Manures.-There are no manures in common use but
compost dunghills, in which they intermix earth, clay, or
water-sand from the burns, with stable-dung and ashes:

   Seedtime.-What and rye would shoot before winter, if
sown as early in warm as in cold or stiff soils, and would not
be easily kept from cattle if they were not sown late; they are
laid down from Martinmas to the end of December.  Oats
and pease from 12th March to 12th April.  Oats are short,
and pease a poor cover, when early sown here, being too for-
ward to have the full benefit of the July rains.  Barley is
sown from 10th May to 10th June.  Of late, it has been
sown in February and March, in dry seasons, and grounds
in high order, which gives the weightiest grain; but, in
other cases, the latest is the thickest and most plentiful crop.
Flax is sown in April,-and pulled; and potatoes are mostly
planted in that month.

   Harvest.-Harvest commonly runs from 20th August to
12 October, new stile.-A state of the crop and live-stock,
of 1793, is subjoined here, being the amount of particulars
noted down at every house, on the report of the people,
comprehending the mains of proprietors, and not omitting
the flax and potatoes of trades-people and day-labourers; by
