flat ground, through which it runs, under water, but very
seldom does any considerable damage, as the current is very
gentle.  There are two or three small lochs near the church,
in which there are some perches;  but the fish are not in such
plenty as to make it worth while to carry them to market. 

   Quarries and Stones.-The stone in this parish is of a very
hard quality.  There is a large quarry wrought in Aber-

and build dykes with them.

in the low country.  The sheep were formerly small;  but

annually imported from the fourth, the species is greatly im-

   Popuation.-In the year 1787, the number of souls a-
