cularly on that fine extensive bank of the Mulbuy, called
Auchterflow.  In the Northern vale, there is a good deal of
moss, on a tilly or clay bottom, of a bad quality and general-

hill tops consist chiefly of a black sandy soil, covered with
poor short heath, and a few moor stones intermixed, much
better adapted for plantations of the Scots sir, than for pas-
turage.

excessive use of spiritual liquors.

   Sea Coast,-its Advantages and Productions.-The Northern
part of Scotland derives many advantages from those beauti-
ful arms of the sea with which it is intersected.  Of these
the parish of Avoch is not without its share.  The frith
washing it nearly on two sides, makes the air much more
falubrious; without those fogs and that piercing coldness,
which the inhabitants of the East coast of Scotland complain
of, from the neighbourhood of the German Ocean.  It also
makes the snows sooner melt in winter; and prevents immo-
derate heat in summer, by that agreeable and refreshing cool-
ness, which every flowing of the tide sends forth.  It affords
likewise employment for many of the inhabitants, and adds
