remuneration and support to those who are engaged in them; and
all who are of sober and industrious habits are well able to live
comfortably, and to bring up and educate their families in a decent
and respectable manner. It has, however, been generally remark-
ed, that those who receive the highest wages are commonly the
most idle and dissipated, often neglecting both the maintenance
and the education of their families.

  The harbour at Leven is entirely a natural one, and is formed
by a creek at the mouth of the river. At spring-fides, it admits
vessels of about 300 tons burden, but it is rather difficult of ac-
cess, owing to the banks of sand, which are frequently shifting
by heavy sea storms, or floods in the river. There is a small quay,
lately built, where the ships are unloaded; but it is altogether in-
sufficient for the increasing trade of the port.

              V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

  Market-Towns.--The only town in the parish is Leven, with a
Population of above 2000. It lies on the sea shore, At the mouth
of the river of the same name, and consists of two principal streets
running parallel to each other, with a variety of bye-lanes. Weav-
ing of linen is the staple trade of the place, and affords steady em-
ployment to the inhabitants. A board of police, according to the
Act of Parliament, has been established here, for some years, and
its labours are chiefly directed to the cleaning and lighting of the
  FIFE.
