bouring mill, together with the difficulty of procuring feed
in this inland situation.  There are a few farms having ex-
tensive meadows along the Spey, which are extremely
productive of grass, but liable to frequent overflows; to re-
medy which one of the most extensive meadows has been
lately surrounded with an earthen bank by the proprietor,
which rescues it completely from the summer and harvest
floods, so that rich crops of corn can be now with safety
raised, where the grass was formerly precarious.  The
gentlemen of the parish have begun of late to lime their
lands, which has answered extremely well, producing
luxuriant crops of corn and grass; but the inferior tenants
cannot be prevailed on to adopt this mode of farming,
though very sensible of its benefit, alleging as a cause
their poverty and shortness of their leases, from 5 to 9
years.  It might be for their benefit that the proprietor
would article in their leases, that so much must be limed
annually.  The parish abounds with fir, birch, alder,
and a few oaks; one proprietor only has an exclusive right
to the woods on his own estate, who has lately let a lot of
it to a Company, which will probably bring him L. 2000
before the expiration of the lease; the other woods are
subjected to a servitude, (i. e. all the feuars have an equal
privilege), which is a great loss to the proprietors, and,
upon the whole, a disadvantage to the tenants, as on this
account no melioration is allowed for houses, and now
all the principal wood is mangled and destroyed by this
libertine mode of cutting, so that they can hardly be sup-
plied from them with the necessary timber.-The old Scots
plough is generally used; the gentlemen use the English
plough, from which they find a great benefit.  All the
farm-work is carried on with horses, of which they must
have a great number on account of their fuel, which is at
a great distance, and difficult of access for those on the N.
