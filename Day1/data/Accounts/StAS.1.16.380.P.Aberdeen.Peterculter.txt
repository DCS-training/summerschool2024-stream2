   Antiquities.-The hill where the two men were killed
by lightning, is commonly called the Hill of the Old-town.
It does not rise to a great height, and has a pretty exten-
sive plain on the top, partly cultivated.  On the N. E.
end is the farm of Oldtown, and the farm of Hilltown on
the S. W. end. Betwixt them lies a heath.  On the N. W.
side of it, a wall and ditch run from N. E. to S. W. about
3 quarters of a mile, along the slope of the hill, which is
there separated from the public road by a small valley.
From each end of this wall, and almost at right angles to
it, ramparts had been carried S. E. towards the river Dee,
which is about a mile distant from the angular points.
Farm-houses, huts, folds, and tillage, render these ramparts
indistinct; but it is manifest that they had not been carried
all the way to the river.  The inequality and rocky na-
ture of the ground would have rendered that a difficult
work.  It is probable that there were then thickets and
places of boscage on the river side, and they might have
cut down trees to complete the barricade in these parts.
At the N. E. and S. W. angles, there had been half-moon
work constructed.  The top of the bank is, in some places,
8 or 9 feet above the bottom of the ditch.  In most pla-
ces the height is about 6 feet.  But in the course of cen-
turies, much of the wall must have tumbled down, and
much of the ditch must have been filled up.
   No history, to which I have access, makes mention of
this military work.  Tradition has done no more than
transmitted some names.  The rampart is called "Nor-
"man's dike;" half cultivated lands adjacent to it, are call-
ed "The Norman faughs."  A large fountain, close to
the eastern rampart, bears the name of "Norman's well."
These names, together with the form and situation of the
work, serve to shew that it has been a Danish encampment.
For we know that the Danes and Norwegians invaded
