   Stipend.-This remote parish is celebrated in the Eccle-
siastidcal Annals of Scotland, for its process of augmentation,
on teh decision of which, in a great measure, depended the
income of the ministers of Scotland.  The question was ve-
ry briskly litigated before the Court of Session, and was af-
terwrds appealed to the House of Lords, by whom it was
decided favourably to the wishes of the clergy; in conse-
quence of which, the stipend was finally modified at L. 578,
16s.  Scotch of money, and 108 lisponds of butter, with
L. 40 Scotch for communion-elements.  Each lispond of
butter is computed at 30 lb. consequently, in all, there are
3240 lib. of butter payable to the minister.  The usual
conversion is at the rate of L. 4, 16 s. Scots per lispond.

   State of Property.-The best account of the state of pro-
perty in this district, is to be found in the following proven
rental, as ascertained in 1791, in the course of the process
of augmentation.
