     Statistical Account

that these ordinances shall not be administered, without cer-
tificates from the clerk, bearing, that the facts of births, con-
tract of marriages, etc. have been duly entered in the records
of session.-In the body of the parish, for some years past,
the births did not exceed 17 per annum.  The number of
baptisms, during last year, was 47, and of marriages, 17.  It
is difficult, at present, to ascertain the deaths that annually
happen in the parish, as some, in the detached bounds above
mentioned, bury their dead in the burial grounds of adja-
cent parishes; and of late, others have been so wise as to in-
ter in ground within the district, recently set apart for that
purpose.  The number of burials last year was 21.

   Food, Fuel, Diseases, etc.-The principal food of the peo-
ple, in general, is potatoes, of which they now raise great
quantities.  Along with these they have butter, cheese, milk,
and fish; and such of them as are richer have sometimes
mutton and beef.  They are well provided in fuel, the mosses
which cover a great part of the parish furnishing them with
peats; and, in the winter nights, the moss fir, when dried and
cut into stakes, affords a strong, though not a clear light, and
serves them instead of candles.  The most prevalent distem-
pers are rheumatisms, fluxes, consumptions, and fevers of the
nervous and intermitting kinds, all which may be attributed
to the moistness of the air, the damp situation of the houses
in general, and their low and confined structure.  The small-
pox used to make terrible havock, till, about 5 years ago, a
gentlewoman, by introducing innoculation, was the means of
preserving many lives.  She innoculated 99 with her own 
hand, and paid them such attention, during the progress of 
the malady, that, except one, they all recovered.
