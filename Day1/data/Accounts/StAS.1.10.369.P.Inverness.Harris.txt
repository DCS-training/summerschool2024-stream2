beef salted for winter and spring provision.  The industrious
tenant, even of a farthing land, if not unfortunate, can have
of all these a competency suited to his rank, from the vari-
ous produce of his little farm, from the first of harvest to the
last of the spring season, and may pay his rents by his earn-
ings at summer labour, either in manufacturing kelp or en-
gaging in such other employ as he can procure.  He may
either purchase from a merchant, or rear on his own ground,
some coarse flax, which is manufactured into shirts and other
linens for the use of the family, by his wife and daughters, as
their winter evenings amusement.  In the same manner is he
cloathed warmly and decently from the fleece of his little
flock.
   The third class of the people, whom we have denominated
cotters, are tacksmens servants, constantly employed in the
labours of the farm.  They have generally grass, on the same
pasture with their master's cattle, for one milch cow with its
followers, i. e. a three year, a two year, and one year old, a
working horse and breeding mare, besides sheep, in the num-
ber of which they are seldom restricted, and a farthings di-
vision of land for corn and potatoes with its proportion of
sea-ware for manure.  They have also a kail-yard, fuel, and
a weekly allowance of a peck of meal  They are allowed a
day in the week to work for themselves, which, with the help
of their families, is sufficient for raising and repairing their
crops.  A grieve, or overseer, and grass-keeper, if married
men, and holding lands in heu of wages, have more in pro-
portion to the weight of tim several charges committed to
them.  Having no rents to pay, and being seldom under the
necessity of buying meal, unless she harvest prove very bad,
they live on the whole better than the tenant of a farthing
land.
