serted to their credit, that in them a marked change of
manners in point of civility and good breeding is very vi-
sible, which must be observed with pleasure by every one
who has the happiness of society at heart.  The time has
been, and at no distant period, when a Seceder not only
thought himself, but boldly declared himself to be better
than his neighbour, whilst fourness of temper, and fullen
morose manner were his distinguishing characteristics.
To be chearful and happy in innocent amusements, would
have subjected those of this fect to the censure of their
brethen, and vengeance of thier clergy, and to have smi-
led on a Sunday, or associated with a churchman, would 
have been deemed impiety.  The writer hereof, however,
can fay with confidence, that, in the discharge of his duty,
when visiting his parish, he went into every house with-
out distinction; and that the Seceders, with perharps one
exception, received him as cordially, and listened to his
prayers and admonitions with as much decency and atten-
tion as his own hearers.  The rancour of contending sects
now happily begins to subside; and whether such change
proceeds from a different behaviour, being inconsistent
with their worldly interest, and exposing them to the ri-
dicule and pity of every liberal and good man, or from
novelty having loft its influence, or from the divisions a-
mong themselves, or from their now entertaining more ra-
tional and enlightened views of true and undefiled reli-
gion, or from all or several of these causes united; still the
effect is pleasant and the praise to which the Seceders are
in this respect entitled, cannot in justice be withheld.
