upon the chief entry to the tower.  At present it is ruinous,
but forms a very beautiful object in the lake.
   In this parish there is a Roman camp, a little to the west-
ward of the house of Lochore, which is still remarkably en-
tire, although, in some places, it is levelled and defaced.  Its
form is nearly square.  There appear, on the north and west
sides, three rows of ditches, and as many ramparts of earth
and stone.  There is a round turret on that side which is
next the loch, the total circumference measuring about 2020
feet.
   It has been conjectured, with much probability, that this
was the spot where the ninth legion was attacked, and nearly
cut off, by the Caledonians, as we have it narrated by Taci-
tus in his life of Agricola.  The present proprietor of Loch-
ore, in prosecuting the plan mentioned above, for draining
the lake, having occasion to cut some ditches immediately
under the camp, the workmen have dug up several antiqui-
ties, which are evidently Roman, particularly the head of a
Roman spear.  Just by the camp is a village called Blair,
which, in the original, is said to signify locus pugnae, or a
place where a battle has been fought.
