er extent, are sown in the open fields, which is bringing win-
ter herding more into use; and the quantity of ley-grass is
much increased.
   After 3 years rest, they have 2 good crops of oats before
barley, with the benefit of better summer feeding for their
cattle, an increase of milk, and enlargement of the breed, in
consequence of resting the ground.  Potatoes were little
known before the year 1745, and, when tried, yielded no
crops but in lazy beds, or new ground that sent up no
weeds.  It was long before they learned to keep them pro-
perly clean.  Now, nobody misses plentiful crops; and they
are the best improvement in the cultivation of our corn
fields, where, by some, they are trenced down, with dung,
by the spade, but many have discovered, at length, that,
with clean keeping, the best crops are after the plough.
The farmers give ground to every cottager for his dung and
culture, which has greatly lessened the consumption of grain,
and is the chief subsistence of the labouring poor.  The po-
tatoe crop is succeeded by wheat or barley, with sown grass;
and where grass is not sown in potatoe-ground, they have 2
crops of oats after the wheat or barley; then they take
barley, pease, and 2 crops of oats again.  Flax is commonly
sowm after barley; and wheat sometimes after sown grass,
when broke up.
   The tillage is much better since the introduction and ge-
neral use of English ploughs.  There is one indisputable fact,
which I can only ascribe to the potatoe culture, and increase
of grass and resting, that the barley crops are not nearly so
much choked as formerly by the gool or yellow gowan,
which is almost banished here, in comparison of former times.
But, with our sown grasses, we have got a plentiful importa-
tion of ragweed.
