   Church and Stipend.-The collegiate church of Biggar was
built in 1545, by Malcolm 3d Lord Fleming, Lord High
Chamberlain of Scotland, and largely endowed by him for
the support of a provost, 8 prebendaries, 4 singing boys, and
6 poor men.  It is built in the form of a cross: the fabric is

in money, 3 chalders of oat-meal, and 1 chalder of barley;

L. 3:8:0.  Lord Elphinstone is patron.-A Burgher meet-
