     Statistical Account

These frost mists are observed to attract each other; and
wherever they rest, they destroy vegetation when in a certain
state, or where their baleful influence is not counteracted by
particular circumstances.  The half of a field contiguous to
the running water or moss is often destroyed, while the more
remote half, on the same level, or part equally near, but more
elevated, remains safe.  In part of a field of potatoes in the
line of the attraction of two mists, the stems became black
and soft like soap, while the neighbouring drill remained
green and vigorous.  These frost mists manifest their noxi-
ous quality first on the potatoe stems, second crop of clo-
ver, and pease.  It requires a greater degree of intensity in
the frost to hurt other crops:  It scarcely affects turnips.  The
stems of the potatoes and clover grow black and soft, and fall
down; the leaves, and the pods of the pea, are spotted with
white spots.  The potatoes is supposed to grow no more,
though the roots are safe; the pease, in proportion to their
greenness, are soft, wrinkled, and watery, become of the co-
lour of a pickled olive, and acquire a disagreeable sweetish
taste:  When threshed, the frost  bitten are distinguished from
the sound by throwing them into water; the sound sink, the
others swim.  A field of oats, when frost bitten, acquires in
a few-days a blueish cast; and barley, if early frosted, as in
1784, remains erect in the head, which acquires a redish
brown colour, or, if later, a deadish whiteness.  The kernels,
when unhusked immediately after the frost, are wrinkled,
soft, and watery, and, after a while, grow shriveled and dry.
The kernel of frosted oats, even if threshed in spring, when
examined between the eye and the light, appears cloudy, and
not of that uniform transparency which found grain posses-
ses.

   In the morning after the frost the vegetables are stiffened;
