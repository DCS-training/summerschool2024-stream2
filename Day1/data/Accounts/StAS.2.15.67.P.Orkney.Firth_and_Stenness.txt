                      PARISH OF FIRTH AND STENNESS.

                 PRESBYTERY OF CAIRSTON, SYNOD OF ORKNEY.

                  THE REV. WILLIAM MALCOLM, MINISTER.

                    I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
           Extent, &c.-THESE united parishes are situated in the mainland
	of Orkney, having Kirkwall on the east; Orphir on the south;
	Stromness and Sandwick on the west; Harra and Rendal on the
	north. The extreme length is about 9 miles; the breadth vari-
	ous. The face of the parishes, in general, is not very agreeable,
	owing to the many moors and hilly ridges covered with heath and
	peat moss to the summit. The whole extent of coast, in both pa-
	rishes, including the small islands of Damsay, and the holm of
	Grimbister in the bay of Firth, is about 10 miles. The shores
	are low and flat.

                              II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
	   Parochial Register.-A register of baptisms and marriages has
	been regularly kept for a long time.
	   Land-owners.-The chief of these are,-Mrs Stewart, Burness,
	(liferentrix,) valuation, L. 140, 19s. 6d.; Earl of Zetland, L. 37,
	18s. 6d.; James Baikie, Esq. of Tankerness, L. 27, 10s.; and
	between fifty and sixty smaller proprietors.
