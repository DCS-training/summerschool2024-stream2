oats, bear, and potatoes, with a small quantity of peese, rye-
grass, clover, and flax.  Seldom, however, do the crops,
though apparently strong and heavy, come to perfection;
owing to the high winds, frosts, and mildews, to which this
parish is very much subject.  The unconfined wandering of
sheep, and other cattle, in the winter time, is a strong check
to the sowing of much rye-grass and clover.  Nor is the
cultivation of lint less discouraged, by the careless or disho-
nest management of it at the lint-mill; the quantity returned
usually bearing so small a proportion to what has been sent
thither, as to exceed all belief, and in some instances to be
perfectly shameful, and to carry the appearance of jest, banter,
or insult, as well as of fraud and plunder.  This, however, by
no means alludes to the lint-mill at Morton.

   Improvements and Disadvantages.-Within these 20 years,
agriculture has been carried on here to a much greater extent
than formerly, by means of lime brought from a quarry, be-
longing to the Earl of Dumfries, about 5 miles from the cen-
ter of this parish.  At present, however, it seems to be much
on the decline.  For most of the land capable of improve-
ment has been limed, and will not so well admit of a repeated
operation in that way, except where the soil is dry, and af-
ter a crop of turnips or potatoes.  The struggle, too, with
an unfriendly climate still subsists; though no doubt it might
be greatly diminished by means of ditches, quick-set hedges,
and broad belts of planted wood, at convenient distances, and
in a proper direction; as it is usually observed that, under
this kind of shelter, even the frost makes no impression, when,
in exposed situations, juicy plants are quite blasted all around.
Yet, effectual and valuable as this species of improvement
would certainly be found, it is more than can be expected
from tenants, whose leases extend no farther than 19 years;
