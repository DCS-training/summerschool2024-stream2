  The black-grouse and moorfowl are found in the moorland dis-
trict of the parish. Partridges are plentiful. This season, that
beautiful little bird the golden-wren has made its appearance. In
the short days of winter, it is very active in examining the chinks
of the trunks of old trees, and pouncing upon the unsuspecting
insect that had laid itself up for the winter. The yellow wagtails
commonly build their nests in the heaps of coals that are placed
near the mouth of the coal-pit. They have a strong attachment
for their young ones. Last year, a coal heap required to be re-
moved, and in it was found a yellow wagtail's nest, with young
ones in it. The old birds showed great anxiety at the removal of
their brood: they followed those who bad the nest. A shelve
was put up in a pig-sty, and the nest placed upon it, and the old
ones came and fed their young, until they were able to shift for
themselves. They seemed to pay no regard to the inhabitants of
the sty. It seldom happens that such opposite characters are
found sleeping in the same dormitory.
   The wild duck frequents the small lochs of the parish; and the
wild goose is sometimes to be seen in Loch Coulter.
