nearly as large as the ball of a pocket pistol.  They were
generally bought up, from those who fished for them, by
people from Brechin; and it is said that this trade turned
out to good account to some individuals engaged in it.
More than twenty years ago it was given up; some say,
that there was not the same demand for the pearls as for-
merly.  It is asserted, however, that the shells were nearly
exhausted, by reason of the great number of hands employ-
ed in collecting them.
   The only remarkable mountain in this parish is St Ar-

It is a small hollow, surrounded with moorish ground.  At

earth, of 150 or 160 stones weight, have been thrown out
from the adjoining ground, without any visible cause.

depth of a foot and a half, or two feet, there appears a

a good red ochre.  I have been informed by one who has
resided many years in the neighbourhood, that such erup-
