nants above the kirk, where two thirds of the parish, an

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the num-

more than 100 within these 10 or 12 years past, owing to 
decayed farmers and others having removed to manufactu-

males 736, females 788, under 8 years of age 306.  There 
are 2 Episeopalrans, upwards of 100 Roman Catholics, most-

parish of Glengairden; all the other parishioners are of the 
Established Church*.
