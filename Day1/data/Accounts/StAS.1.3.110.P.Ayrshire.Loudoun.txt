improved by lime; and a small part is light and gravelly.
The rent of the arable land, about thirty years ago, was
from 5 s. to 10 s. it is now from 10 s. to L. 1: 4: 0 per acre;
near the villages an acre gives two, and some acres three
pounds.

   Prices of Horses, Labour, and Servants Wages.-Working
horses, twenty years ago, sold from L. 10 to L. 16, and now
from L. 16 to L. 25.  The wages of men servants are now L. 7
and L. 8 annually.  Some labourers, that have houses in the 
villages, or near farmers houses, are occasionally employed.
Their wages in winter are 1 s. or 8 d. and their victuals, in
summer 1 s. 2 d.  Masons of late receive 1 s. 8 d. per day,
and house-carpenters 1 s. 6 d. besides their victuals.  Women
servants receive from L. 1: 5 to L. 1: 15 per half year.  There
are about 100 ploughs in the parish, mostly of the old Scots
kind, with improvements.  Milk cows sell, near the time of
calving, from five to seven or eight guineas.

   Produce and Prices of Grain.-The parish produces more
provisions than serve the inhabitants.  The tenants trans-
port meal, butter, cheese, and veal, to Edinburgh, Glasgow,
and Pailey, etc.  The average price of meal is 11 1/4 d. per
peek, for twenty years past; bear 19 s. per boll of eight
bushels, for the same period.  Butter from 10 s. to 12 s. per
stone,-skimmed milk cheese, when perfectly new, gives 3 s. 4 d.
and in winter 4 s. per stone iron weight; sweet milk cheese
is from 6 s. to 8 s. per stone.  Butcher meat of all kinds never sells
high in our little village; whenever it is high, every thing is 
carried to the great towns.  Lamb, when early, is sold from
10 s. to 20 s.; veal brings 8 d. per pound etc.  It is a pro-
fitable branch to the farmer to fatten his early calves; when
two or three months old, they bring from L. 2 to L. 4 each.
