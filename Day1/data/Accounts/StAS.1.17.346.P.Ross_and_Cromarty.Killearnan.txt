   Rent.-The valued rent of this parish, including that of
Wester Kessock, annexed, quoad sacra, to Kilmuir Wester, is
1873 L. 12 s. 7 d. Scots.  The real gross rent exceeds 2000 L.
Sterling.

   Population.-In order to ascertain the comparative popu-
lation betwixt the years 1755, (when the return was made
to Dr Webster), and 1795, it is necessary to observe, that its
boundaries have undergone considerable alterations, in con-
sequence of a decreet of the Court of Teinds, passed in the
1756, annexing the neighbouring parish of Suddy to those
of Killearnan and Kilmuir Wester.  The most accurate me-
thod will therefore be, to compare the returns of the three
parishes of Killearnan, Suddy, and Kilmuir Wester, as stated
in the 1755, with those of Killearnan and the united parishes
of Kilmuir and Suddy.
