means the White Promontory.  It is singular, indeed, that
in almost all languages, the words ness, noss, nose, have al-
most the same meaning.  These united parishes are situated
in the Mainland of Shetland, and not far from Lerwick the
capital.  The parish is about ten miles in length, and in
some places five in breadth, besides some detached islands,
inhabited by fishermen.  Some of these islands are four
miles distant from the main parish, from which they are se-
parated by a dangerous sea.

   Population.-By the return to Dr Webster, in 1755, the
population of the united parishes amounted to 1412, of all
ages.  At present there are 352 families, and the number
of inhabitants is 1786; of which 1431 are examinable per-
sons.  The population has therefore increased to the amount
of 374 souls.

   Churches.-There are two places of public worship, at
the distance of three miles from each other, which are regu-
larly attended by the minister, and by the people in their
respective neighbourhoods.  It cannot be expected, that in
so remote a district, two churches in one parish could be re-
markable for their construction.

   Manse.-The manse is situated on the most frequented
road in Shetland, being a thorough-fare between the town
of Lerwick and all the western parts of Shetland, and the
town of Scalloway and all the northern parts.  It is the
only manse or gentleman's house in the country that is not
situated near the sea, and, consequently, it wants all the ad-
vantages of fish and fishing-boats, of such essential conse-
quence in so northern a situation.  This, with the scarcity
of sheep-pasture in the neighbourhood, is a great loss and
inconvenience to the minister.
