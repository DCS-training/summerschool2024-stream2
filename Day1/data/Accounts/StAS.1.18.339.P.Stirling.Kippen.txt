mined in 1763 to have two established schools; the salary was
advanced to L. 115 Scots, of which L. 75 is allotted to the
schoolmaster at Kippen, the remaining L. 40 to the other
teacher.  In the year 1782 a schoolhouse, including a
dwelling-house for the master, was built at Claymires.  It is in
sufficient repair and tolerably commodious.  The school-
master at Kippen is but indifferently accommodated.  In for-
mer times, a house was occasionally rented for the school,
and the master was seldom accommodated with a dwelling-
house.  The school was held in the church for some time
previous to its reparation in 1779.  Since that time a house
has been rented, on a long lease, for a school-house, and dwell-
ing-house for the master; neither of which, however, are
very commodious.-In the school at Kippen, are taught
reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, Latin, and
church music.  The whole emoluments of the schoolmaster,
including his salary and fees as session clerk, may amount an-
nually to L. 25 or L. 30 sterling*.  As the distance from the
two established schools is more than 4 miles, the inhabitants
of the intermediate district find it convenient to employ a
teacher during the winter months to instruct younger children
in the elements of reading and writing.  The number of
scholars last winter, when the schools were most frequent,
was at Kippen 60, at Arnprior 36, at Claymires 64.
