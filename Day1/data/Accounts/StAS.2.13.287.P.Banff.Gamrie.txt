   remains yet a large proportion of waste ground that might be
   brought under cultivation with advantage.
      The extent of the Troup estate, according to a late survey, when
   reduced from Scots to imperial acres, is as follows:-

                   Imp. acres arable   Do. pasture    Do. wood or    Roads, stances
                     or cultivated.     or waste.     planting      of houses, &c.
   Troup estate,             4665        4655            721           184
   Whitehill and
    Greenskains,              960         502              0             9
        Whole,              502.5           5157         721           193

      Altogether Troup, Whitehill, and Greenskains, are generally
   considered as amounting to half the parish, both as to extent and
   value of land ; and the following may be taken as a fair average
   calculation of the whole in imperial acres:-

  Acres cultivated,             10,000
	Acres pasture or waste land,	10,000
  Acres in wood,                   750
  Acres in roads, houses, &c.      300
      Of the 10,000 acres waste land,. about 3000 or 4000 may be
   capable of tillage, and would yield a fair remuneration for capital
   laid out on it. The remainder, from the mountainous nature of
   the ground, want of water on the heights, and other causes, may
   be considered irreclaimable.
