     Statistical Account

the greater part of which is a sandy beach, with a, beautiful
and rich carpet of grass, to the very sea-mark.  From every
part of this coast there is a beautiful prospect of the Frith
of Clyde, land-locked, as it were, on all sides, by the coast
of Cunningham, island of Bute, island of Arran, Kintyre,
the coast of Ireland, and the coast in the parishes of Kirkum,
Ballantrae, Colmonel, and Girvan.  The scene, varied by
the different height and appearance of the above coasts, with
the many small island interspersed along them, renders the
whole view most delightful.  What adds to the beauty and
grandeur of the prospect, is the noble rock of Ailsa, set
down in the middle of the Frith.  This coast commands the
nearest, most distinct, and regular view of this rock.  In a
clear day, it is easy to discern the remains of a castle upon it,
with several roads diversified by spots of verdure.  It stands,
in a circular form, about 15 English miles from the shore,
and belongs to the Earl of Cassillis*.
   The half of this coast towards the north is very favour-
able for sea-bathing; partly because the sea gradually deep-
ens for a considerable way, while the bottom is perfectly
clear of all rocks and stones; but chiefly because it lies at
a considerable distance from any fresh water, being 8 miles
south from the river of Doon, and 4 miles north from that
of Girvan.  At present the principal inconvenience for bath-
ing, is the want of proper habitations.

Dailly, being annexed to a Barony, the property of the Earl
of Cassillis, in that parish, yet the tacksmen of it have, from
time immemorial, resided in this parish.
