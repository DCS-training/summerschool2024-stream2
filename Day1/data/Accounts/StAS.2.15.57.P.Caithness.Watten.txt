number of which are now annually shipped to Leith, Newcastle,
and London. Great advantages have also followed from the spi-
rited exertions of the county gentlemen to improve the breed of
cattle, sheep, horses, &c., by giving annual premiums to the ex-
hibitors of the best stock. So successful, indeed, have these been,
that this county need not now dread a competition in these mat-
ters, open to all Scotland, as was amply shown at the Highland
Society's meeting at Inverness in 1839.

                      V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Market-Town.-There are no market or other towns in the pa-
rish. The nearest market-town is Wick, distant eight miles.
   Means of Communication.-The means of communication en-
joyed by the parish are, one post-office, (at the bridge of Watten),
being a sub-office to Wick,-twenty miles of turnpike roads, (along
seven miles of which the mail passes daily, and a carrier twice a-
week), and various bridges, all of inconsiderable, size, excepting two
at Watten and Dunn.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is very inconveniently
situated, being distant from the north-east extremity of the parish
only one mile, and nearly nine miles from the south-west. The
date of its erection is unknown. It appears from the session re-
cords to have been repaired in 1714. Since that period, it has
received several repairs, and was propped with wooden supports
two years ago. It is in a very bad state. It may accommodate
from 700 to 800 persons, and the sittings are all free. The
manse was built in 1778. There is a glebe of 24 acres worth
about 15s. per acre, and the amount of stipend iis 14 chalders,
half meal and half barley, with L.10 for communion elements.
There is no Government church, Dissenting, Seceding, Episcopa-
lian, or Roman Catholic chapel in the parish. There is one mis-
sionary in the Highland part of it, supported partly by the Royal
Bounty Committee, and partly by the people; also, a cate-
chist. The number of families attending the Established Church
