courser in the wool; at this moment there is not the smallest
vestige of our country breed remaining, all the stock ewes in
the parish being black faced and coarse wooled:  Two causes
have been assigned for the total neglect of the native breed:
1st, Since the rise of the flesh-meat took place, it hath been
the object of the graziers to pay more attention to the bulk
of the carcase than to the fineness of the wool. 2dly, About
the year 1763, a new mode of grazing was introduced; the
face of the hills being appropriated to the feeding of black
cattle, it was found that our native breed of sheep were not
fond of the course grass in the muir, constantly seeking after
the short bite on the Campsie Fells, it became absolutely ne-
cessary, therefore, if we were to follow this system of gra-
zing, to procure such a breed of sheep as were fitted for the
muir ground.
   At present, the wool in this parish I believe to be as good
as any wool of the weedsmuir breed of sheep; when smear-
ed with tar and butter, it fells betwixt six and seven shillings
per stone;-white, as it is termed, fells at ten shillings per
stone; we expect eight pounds of clean washed wool out of
the stone of that which was smeared; and twelve pounds
from the white wool It is chiefly sold to the country peo-
ple in the neighbourhood.  The grazing of black cattle upon
brae ground, is perhaps as well understood in this parish, as
in most places of Scotland; above 900 are fed annually in
this district, either for the butcher, or the Falkirk market;
perhaps 300 of these may be wintered; the remainder bought
in at the Whitsunday markets.
   The winterers graze in the open fields, during the whole
winter season, and are fed once or twice a day with coarse
hay, made of sprats and grass,-gathered in autumn amongst
the cows feet in their pasture; the graziers commonly begin
