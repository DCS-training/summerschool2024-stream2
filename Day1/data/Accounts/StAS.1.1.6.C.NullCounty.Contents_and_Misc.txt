fore thought most advisable to throw as much varie-
ty as possible into the First Volume, that the Reader
might be enabled to form some general idea of the
State of the Kingdom even from this part of the
Work.  Whether the same plan is to be persevered
in, or whether more regularity and connexion are to
be attended to in future, will depend on the unani-
mity and dispatch with which the Clergy transmit the
necessary information to the Author.

   The variety of business, both of a public and of a
private nature, in which I have of late been engaged,
has prevented me from arranging or abridging, so
completely as otherwise I should have done, the an-
swers included in this Volume; and, indeed, that
part of the Work must be attended with considerable
difficulty, unless the Clergy in general will do, what
many of them have very successfully executed, name-
ly, transmit their accounts prepared for immediate
publication.  Answers to the Queries, however, which
have been circulated, are still requested; but, where
it is equally convenient, it is certainly more desirable
that the Clergy should consider the Queries merely as
a key to inquiry; and the models which are now set
before them, together with the annexed Analysis, will
be of service in pointing out the best mode of draw-
ing up the Statistical Account of the different di-
stricts.
