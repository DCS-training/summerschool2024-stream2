   Poor.-There are 60 on the poor's roll; but there is no
fund established, as the law directs, by assessment on the land-
ed property, for their maintenance.  The only parochial fund
for their relief, is the annual interest arising from 70 l.  Ster-
ling, mortified by gentlemen who were heritors of the parish,
and the weekly collections at the church, which amount 10 a-
bout 4 l. a year.  The poor here, as is the case with most
of the poor in the northern counties of Scotland, also
alms, not only at the dwelling houses of the inhabitants of
their own, but of other parishes.  It is much to be wished, that
every parish would enter into a resolution to observe the law
for maintaining their own poor, when they cannot work, as
vagrants and sturdy beggars, who are the pests of society, and
may well be called the public robbers of the poor, would
thus be effectually detected and discountenanced.

   Lakes.-Lochness and its environs furnish excellent mate-
rials for a beautiful landscape.  It lies E. N. E. and W. S.
W. and is 22 miles in length, and from 1 to 2 1/2 in breadth.
The depth, in the middle, is from 60 to 135 fathoms.  The
flowing, occasioned by continued rains, and melting of snow,
is from 8 to 10 feet perpendicular from the low water mark.
The loch is so deep at the sides, that, except at the points of
Torr and Foyers, a ship of the line might fail within her
length of the shore, from end to end, on either side.  The
wind being confined, by the great height of the hills, on both
sides, as it were in a funnel, blows almost always either
streight up or down the loch, a circumstance must against
the navigation of it; as is likewise that of the heavy squalls
which blow from all the glens and gullies, when the wind
inclines either to the north or south.  A decked vessel may
turn to windward, from one end to the other, in moderate
weather in 3 days, but must anchor every night.  There is
