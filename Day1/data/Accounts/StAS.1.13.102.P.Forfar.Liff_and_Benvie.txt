     Statistical Account

the intersections of the neighbouring parishes, the form of
Liff and Bervie is very irregular.  It may be reckoned, on
an average, 3 miles in lenght, and the same nearly in 
breadth.  The ground rises with an easy ascent for the
space of 3 miles from the river Tay, except towards the
S. E. where the end of the hill of Balgay, which is very
moderate in height, and either wholly planted or cultiva-
ted, and a low narrow dale, extending from thence west-
ward through the village of Bervie, intervence.  Along
this agreeable exposure, are interspersed houses, trees, and
fields in culture.  The higher grounds form, as it were, a
ridge, stretching somewhat obliquely from W. to E. Be-
hind these, is a bleak, extensive tract of moor, where are
some thriving plantations of sir, but hardly any mark of
improvement or cultivation.  This moor falls northward
in gradual declivity, and forms, with the opposite grounds,
part of that Strath or valley, which beginning in the parish
of Lundie, and extending eastward a few miles, is called
Strathmartin, an appellation given to one of the parishes
adjoining this district.  In the middle of this strath, runs
a small and rapid stream from the loch of Lundie, which
meets an additional supply, collected here from the hills
above Auchterhouse, and is then called the water of Digh-
ty.  This brook is the northern boundary of these united
parishes, dividing them from Auchterhouse, and is nearly
parallel to the course of the Tay, the Principal boundary

this account of the united parishes of Liff, Including Invergowrie and
Bervie.
