pence attending the several works necessary for putting the
country in immediate possession of a navigable communica-
tion, upon the Rack mill, upon the river Devon, to the
ports of Cambus and Manor, upon the tideway of the Forth,
and from the tideway to Gartmore, upon the upper Forth,
and to the mill of Cardross, upon the river Goodie.
     Resolved,
   VI.  That it be recommended to Mr Callander, as soon
at this paper is printed, to circulate them among the noble-
men and gentlemen concerned in the success of this naviga-
tion; and that he do write to them, at the same time, to
know their opinion of the utility of the proposed measures,
and how far they will give their assistance towards carrying
them into execution.
     Resolved,
   VII.  That, upon allowance obtained from the Honourable
Trustees for Manufactures, another meeting be held, in the
hall of this office, on Monday the 31st January, 1774; in
order to receive the several opinions of the gentlemen in-
terested, and to open a subscription for the purpose above
mentioned.  And they direct that these resolutions shall be
printed and circulated, together with the report and esti-
mates.
