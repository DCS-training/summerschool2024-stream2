a period by far too short to rouse the exertion of the tenant,
and induce him to employ that labour and expence, in melio-
rating the soil, which he might have in his power.  Proprie-
tors of land, it is presumed, would find it ultimately to the
advantage of their estates, did they give more scope to the
farmer, by granting him a lease of triple the ordinary time.
In such a case it might be stipulated, too, that the proprietor
should receive a certain sum of money upon the expiration of
an ordinary lease.  At the commencement of the latest leases
the rents have been nearly doubled.  The land, at an average,
brings about 16 s. per acre, though some farms are let at above
20 s. per acre.  The number of acres in the whole parish, by
a gross calculation, is about 2400, without including the com-
mons; and the present rent is 2214 L.

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-Remarkable instances of longevity
have seldom occurred.  A poor woman died a few years ago,
who must have been 116 years, from what the remembered
to have seen.  The situation of the parish is healthy, there
being no marshy ground or stagnant water, nor any thing to
obstruct a free circulation of air.  There are no diseases pe-
culiar to the place.  Nervous and hysterical disorders are said
to be much more common now than formerly, owing, with-
out doubt, to the way of living, particularly to the more fre-
quent use of spiritous liquors and tea.  The prejudices against
inoculation are far from being removed, especially among
the poorer sort.

   Town, Roads, etc.-COUPAR is divided by a rivulet, which,
turning the mills of Kethock, with two others in its course,
falls into the Isla* , about 5 miles to the westward.  The
