from a variety of causes, the peculiar tenets of that persuasion
took early a deep root in this neighbourhood.  A great va-
riety of opinions have sprung up since that period.  We have
Burghers, Antiburghers.  Cameronians, Bereans, and persons

breathes, polishes the ferocity of nature, and smooths the
ruggedness of the human heart.  Men have discovered, what
they ought always to have known, that their opinions, with
regard to speculative points, are often as different as their
faces; and that the harmony of society, and the intercourse
of life, ought not to be interrupted by the one more than by

"another."
