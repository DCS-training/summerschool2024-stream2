     Statistical Account

ritual and temporal interests of the people are carefully at-
tended to by the Hon. Baron*.
   Of the 22 farmers who occupy the lands in this parish,
eight farm pretty extensively, the rest are small tenants.
Eleven or twelve in the village of Roxburgh are called
cotlanders, possessing from his Grace the Duke of Roxburgh
about two acres of land each, together with a house, yard,
and liberty of pasturing their cows in an adjacent loaning.
This, along with their own industry in some trade, enables
them to bring up their families pretty comfortably.  They
have no lease of their lands, but their rents are seldom rai-
sed, and they are almost never turned away, unless they be-
have ill, or prove troublesome neighbours.  All of them
have families, which being, in general, trained up in the
path of virtue and industry, promise to be useful members
of society.

   Animals.-This parish contains about 160 work, 9 or
10 riding horses, and several young ones to preserve the
stock, 600 black cattle, and 4000 sheep, all good of their
kind, though not distinguished in the neighbourhood either
for size or value.  Birds of all kinds, usually met with in
this country, appear here in their proper seasons.-The
Tweed and Teviot are the only rivers in the parish, and
abound with various kinds of fish, especially salmon, whose
prices are generally regulated by the Berwick market.  A
small purple-coloured trout prevails much here, very deli-
cious to eat, and is said to be peculiar to Teviot.  Such
quadrupeds as generally frequent the southern parts of
Scotland, appear in various corners of this parish, and af-
ford the sportsmen plenty of game in the season.
