     Statistical Account

   Situation, Extent, etc.-Deer is situated almost in the
centre of the district of Buchan, and is bounded on the N.
by the parish of Strichen; on the E. by Lonmay and
Longside; on the S. by Cruden and Ellon; and on the W.
by Newdeer.  From N. to S. its greatest extent is 10
miles; and its mean breadth may be 5 1/2 miles.  The high
road from Aberdeen to Fraserburgh cuts it longitudinally,
and intersected, by the roads from Banff and Old Meldrum
to Peterhead.  One branch of the river Ugie runs through
the middle of the parish; the other branch enters it for a
short way on the N. E.  These, and the other streams in
the parish, turn 13 corn-mills, 3 fulling-mills, 2 lint-mills,
and a set of bleaching machinery.

   Surface and Soil.-There is no hill of any considerable
altitude in this parish.  Irregular ridges of rising grounds
run through it in every direction, forming a multitude of
vallies equally irregular.  Some of the uplands are covered
with heath, and a poor kind of grass; others are planted
with wood; many of them are cultivated; and most of
them susceptible of cultivation.  The braes, and lower
parts of the parish, are in general best cultivated, and well
adapted either for corn or pasture.  An irregular plain of
considerable extent, lying round the church and village of
Deer, is reckoned one of the best summer scenes in the
north,

   On the north of this place lie the woods of Pitfour,
abounding with beautiful scenery; in the middle of which
stands the seat of James Ferguson, Esq. present Member of
Parliament for the county.
   The soil is generally light, upon a gravelly, clayey, or
rocky bottom, abounding with small stones.
