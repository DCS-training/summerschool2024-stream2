and when those parts which were thought to be made,
were neglected for a few years, and allowed to fall into
disrepair, they became the worst fo the whole, at least,
softer than what has remained untouched.  The length
of the principal line, from the public road at the head
of Lochfine, to the S. point of this parish at Aird La-
mont, may, at a moderate computation, be reckoned
above 40 miles.  Of that more than the half is now
completely finished through the parish of Kilmorich and 
the united parishes of Strachur and Stralachlan, and 
they are now working towards the borders of this 
parish; as there is a proper undertaker now em-

next season.  It is also intended to look out for an un-
dertaker to contract for the bridges, which will be many
in number, but none of any great size; without which
the roads, however good, would be entirely useless, as
there are may small waters impassable to wheeled ma-
chines.  Besides this great line, there is another cross
road through this parish, which is now nearly finished.
It comes off from the great line from Inverary to
Campbeltown near Lochgilphead, crosses Lochfine at the 
ferry of Otter, traverses this parish near the N. end;
that of Glendarual at the low or S. part of it; enters
the parish of Inverchaolan at Lochstravon-head, and 
comes to the Clyde at Dunoon, a village on the Cowal
side, about 6 miles from Greenock.

of this parish.  The best anchorage places are in the 
Kyles of Bute, which, as was already observed, is a 
narrow found that divides this parish from that island.
In a variety of places upon either side of that found, a
