   Manufactures.-If we except linen yarn,
and coarse linen cloth, and kelp, which
with propriety may be considered as the

which were formerly manufactured of
Orkney materials, to the great benefit of

triumphed over those difficulties that arose from vulgar pre-
judice; it was diffused pretty generally among the islands;
and is said in years of extreme dearth and scarcity to have
preserved the lives of some poor people, who otherwise would
have died of want, and certainly made those who were em-
