     Statistical Account

sheep, reared on these farms, is a cross breed between the Ga-
la Water and the Tweedsmuir, a species somewhat shorter
than the Cheviot, though longer than the Tweedsmuir.  But
a gentleman from Edinburgh, now in possession of one of
the farms, has much improved the breed by crossing it with
the Cheviot.  He tried also a Spanish ram, but found it did
not answer.  The wool, per stone, of late years, has sold at
from 7 s. to 11 s.  But nothing, perhaps, would more con-
tribute to the improvement of the breed, as well as of the
wool, than the laying down those lands, which are sown
with corn, in pasture grass.  This would, upon the whole,
be even as profitable for the farmer; for though his gains
might be sometimes less, yet they would be much surer.
The reason is obvious-In this high part of the country, the
crops in general are so very late, that they never come to
full maturity.  Besides, they are liable to so many risks,
from winds, frost, and rain, which crops in a lower climate
are not exposed to, that they are seldom got in in good con-
dition.  It sometimes, however, happens, that a dry season,
such as the last has been, may enable the farmer to get in
his corns pretty soon, and tolerably ripe; but this happens
so very seldom, that it is truly surprising, that any man of
consideration should ever venture to run the risk, especially
as his lands might be otherwise laid out, to nearly an equal,
and a more certain advantage: But a lucky season, like a
lucky chance at cards or dice, induces the muirland farmer,
with the gamester, still to venture another stake.

   State of Improvement, etc.-The lands in general are well
cultivated, and many of them inclosed.  This high state of
cultivation is, in a great measure, owing to the spirited ex-
ertions of the late Mr HAMILTON of Fala.  He first set
