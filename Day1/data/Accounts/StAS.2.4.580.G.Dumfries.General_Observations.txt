which early varieties are in use, dividing the labours of seed-time
and harvest, and ripening on late and cold soils. The gardener's
flora has also, but on a smaller scale, been cultivated and improved.
Our wild-flowers are sometimes attractive, especially when the bees
enjoy the full tide of richness and beauty in the clover fields, or
on the purpled heaths; and every watered and rocky cleugh has
its indigenous and beautiful flowers, and the natural meadows are
also beautiful and attractive in season.
	29. The Apiary is too little considered; but no farmer or cot-
tager should want bee, especially as a mode of obtaining the purest
honey without killing the bees, is known and simple; that is, when
the hive is about to cast the first or second time, opening a hole
of from four to six inches diameter in the top, and setting on an
empty skep above, which will soon be filled, and may be removed,
and the place closed up in due time. A bee-master should have
bushes in his garden, and flowering herbs. Bees may be over-
stocked, but in conveying the pollen of plants, they may be useful
in promoting the economy of nature.
