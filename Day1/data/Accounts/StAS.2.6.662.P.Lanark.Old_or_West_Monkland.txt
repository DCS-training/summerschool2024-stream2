pipes, which diverge from the main or supply-pipes by which the
air is transmitted from a large air-receiver, alluded to in a former
page.  These tubes are connected with the main-pipes leading
from the air-receiver, and are cased in brick-work, and heated from
below.  The air passes through these tubes, which are heated so
as to be red hot, and enters into the smelting furnace at a tempe-
rature from 600&deg; to 612&deg; Fahrenheit.  This last and great im-
provement is now universally adopted, and it is to the Messrs
Baird, especially to James Baird, Esq. of Gartsherrie, that we are
indebted for an invention as new and important in the history of
heated air, as Watt's invention was in the history of the steam-en-
gine.  The Messrs Baird were clearly entitled to a patent had they
thought fit to apply for it, but these gentlemen have generously
sacrificed self-emolument, and that in various ways, greatly to their
own loss.
   The following tables will give some idea of the comparative ad-
vantages; and progressive saving accomplished by this great disco-
very.  In 1829, when combustion was produced by cold air, there
was required :

   In furnaces blown with air heated at 450&deg;, and fusion being
produced by coke, the results were-

   It appears that the introduction of hot air into furnaces has been
attended with great saving; 1. by admitting of the use of raw coal
instead of coke ; 2. the saving of fuel used in smelting is in propor-
tion to the temperature to which the air is raised; 3. hot air has in-
creased the make of the furnaces by more than one-third, and has
of course saved much expense in the article of labour; 4. one
steam-engine can blow at least four blast furnaces instead of three.
