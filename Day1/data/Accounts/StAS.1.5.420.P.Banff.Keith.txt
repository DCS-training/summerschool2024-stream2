decline in the yarn trade arises from three causes, the pre-
vailing demand for cotton cloths, which are now afforded
at a very cheap rat; the advanced price of Dutch flax,
the only flax used by our manufacturer of yarn, and a ve-
ry large importation of linen yarn from Ireland to Glas-

manufactured by them was of good quality, owing to which
it had fallen into disrepute; this last cause, however, will soon

according to a regular plan, still adhered to; on which there
now stands a large, regular, and tolerably thriving village,
called New Keith, containing 1075 inhabitants.  The feus
contain 30 feet in front by 70, at a fen-duty of 10 s. per
annum.  This village is the residence of all the manufactu-
rers of note in the parish: according to the success of their
business, therefore, it must either prosper or decline.  It
enjoys the benefit of a well frequented, and plentifully
supplied weekly market; it has, therefore, provisions of all
kinds in plenty, and at a moderate price.  It has also 4 an-
