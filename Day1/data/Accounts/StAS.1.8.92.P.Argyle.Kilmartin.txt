any part.  It abounds with trouts and salmon.  The fishing, to
a certain extent, is the property of an heritor of this parish.
There is a pecular species of fish in it, called black trouts,
which are short and thick, black in the skin, and red in the
fish.  The incumbent has seen one of them that weighed 16 lb.
and when cut up, two small trouts were taken out of it
entire, one of them measuring 12 inches, the other 10.
This fishing, however, has not hitherto been so very produc-
tive, as to make it an object worthy of much public notice.

   Sea Coast and Fish.-The extent of coast will be from 7 to
8 miles, nearly S. and N., formed by an arm of the sea,
called Loch Craignish.  The sea, by which the south part of
this parish and North Knapdale is bounded to the W. and
N. W., is formed into a strait by the Island of Jura, which
divides it from the Western Ocean.  The shore is, for
the most part, high and rocky, except the Bay of Crinan, and
the end of Loch Craignish, (which are fine flat sand), and few
other smaller creeks.
   There is a species of fish taken on this coast, which goes
by the general name of Grey fish.  They are of different
sizes, most of them much larger than herrings.  They are
generally caught in the evening and morning, with rods and
lines, but not in great quantities; though they are very use-
ful, contributing not only to the support of those, who reside
within a mile or two of the coast, during the summer, which
is the scarcest season, but affording them also light in the win-
ter by their oil.-There are likewise in the Bay of Crinan, cod,
ling, turbot, soles, etc. in great abundance; hut the people
are not skillful in catching them.-Herrings are frequently
taken in Loch Craignish and Loch Crinan, though not to any
great extent; also the finest oysters that are any where to be
found, and in great plenty.  In the former, about 6 years
