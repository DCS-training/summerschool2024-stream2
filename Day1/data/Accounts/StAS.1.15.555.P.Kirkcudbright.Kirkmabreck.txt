about 15 miles.  It is about 3 miles broad, for about 6 miles
from its entrance, and then gradually diminishes as it extends
into the country, and divides the shire of Wigton from the
Stewarty of Kirkcudbright.  There is good anchorage in
several places of the Bay, but in particular a little below Cree-
toun (the only town in the parish) to which a ship of 500
tons may come and ride in safety: it has a kind of soft blue
clay bottom, and makes a very safe harbour.  The fisheries,
though not very considerable, are yet worth mentioning; in
the Spring and Summer months, there are a good many sal-
mon taken, and in the Harvest and Winter, there are a con-
siderable quantity of whiting, cod, and flownders got, by
means of what the people call coops, or large creels, so plac-
ed in the water that the fish run into them as the tide ebbs,
and are taken out at low water; so that with these, and a few
shell fish, which is also got in the Bay, this part of the coun-
try is generally well supplied.  There is also a considerable
quantity of sea weed got upon the shore, (which is for the
most part flat and sandy) which by some is made into kelp,
and by others used for manure.  Much more might have been
said of the advantages of this as a maritime place, had an
abler pen been employed to describe them.
