ing 265 capable of attending school; and admitting that 177 do
so, there must be 83 who are not recieving regular public instruc-
tion at any of the schools in the parish.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.-There are in this parish several
mortifications for the support of the poor. In 1615, James Mar-
quis of Hamilton, in conjunction with Mr John Howison, minister
of Cambuslang, mortified a sum of money, the yearly interest of
which was directed to be employed for maintaining in an hospital
in Hamilton eight poor men, two of whom were always to belong
to the parish of Cambuslang. Gabriel Hamilton of Westburn, in
1700, mortified 600 merks, the interest of which was to be laid out
in buying shoes and hose to the indigent. James Glassford, Esq.
of the family of Douglaston, mortified L. 106, in 1828, the interest
of which amounts to L. 1, 10s. for providing clothing to poor child-
ren attending school, and to the more necessitous and better be-
having poor. There is an annual collection for coals, which
amounts to about L. 3, and Mr Farie, tacksman of the Duke of
Hamilton's colliery, usually furnishes twenty-four carts annually at
his own expense.
	The number of poor upon the ordinary poors' roll is 58, including
widows, 15 of whom have families, perhaps about 100 persons in all.
The regular contributions are L.100 in six months, or L. 200 per
annum, which is at the rate of L. 3, 1Os. each per annum, or if 100
in all be dependent on these funds, it will be L. 2 each. Only one
twenty-seventh of the population are paupers, and the greater por-
tion of these are rendered incapable of earning a livelihood from
debility or old age. The collection at the church door, for the
last five years, was as follows: In 1830, L. 31, l1s. 8 1/2d.; 1831,
28, 16s. 9 1/4d.; 1833, L. 23, 8s. 0 3/4d.; 1834, L. 25, 16s. 5d.;
1835, L.25, 14s. 2d. Total L. 135, 9s. 1 1/4d. Average, L. 23,
1s. 9d. The sum of L. 23,. 1s. 9d. per annum will average 218
halfpennies every Sunday; and if 450 be the average attendance,
scarcely one-half of those who attend put any thing into the plate.
The average amount to those who contribute regularly wil not ex-
ceed 2s. per annum.
	The mortcloth dues for the last six years during summer and
winter were as follows:
