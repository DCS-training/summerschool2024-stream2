but there is seldom work performed in this way.-The price
of beef, mutton, and pork, is at present, at an average, about
2 d. per lib.; of a goose, 1 s. 2 d.; poultry, 4 d. each; which
is double, in some instances treble, their value, at the period

and the weaving of linen cloths, however, seem to be daily
more and more increasing in the country.

and, as to spirituous liquors, the encouragement given by the
legislature to the erecting of a number of small distilleries,
seems to be very unfavourable both to the health and morals
of the lieges, especially on account of the consumption in
