   Page 487, line 2 d from the top, for weasels, white rats,
read weasels or white rats:  White-rat is the Scots name for
weasel.-Page 491, line 1st, dele &.-P. 491, about the mid-
dle, instead of 'building new churches," etc. my representa-
tion was, 'for erecting or establishing new parishes.'  Build-
ing new churches, without clergymen to officiate in them,
would be a nonsensical idea.-P. 493, line 5th from the bot-
tom, instead of 'Roman fortifications,' foisted in I know not
how, read simply 'fortifications:' for no Roman ever forced
his way to the west beyond Tayindrom, Scotia dorfsum, or
Druim Alabain; so that Roman fortifications would confound
all history.-P. 493, line 4th from the bottom, instead of
'fusee' read 'fosse.'-P. 495, line 7th. from the top, insert,
(as in the original MS.) 'This was probably the horn of the
'bison, a creature of the cow kind, of old an inhabitant of
'some northern regions.'-If agreeable, you may add the
following dimensions of a skull of the cow kind, found at
Lismore since the publication of the Statistical Account, and
now lying at Lochnell house.  The dimensions are perhaps
not to be matched in the natural history of Britain.
