     were all slaughtered without mercy, by the superior numbers of their
     foes;-and, accordingly, there is a small eminence at a little dis-
     tance called "Druim nan Cairnan," or the hill of tumuli, where
     the remains of the slain are supposed to be interred. But as there
     is no other specimen of such monuments in the island, it is more
     probable that the stone was erected (as the foreign sounding name
     "Clach an Trushial" may imporQ to commemorate the fall of
     one of those famous invaders, who were wont to commit depreda-
     tions on this island; perhaps some mighty Dane, or one of those
     "sons of Lochlin," of whom the "Bard of other times" delight-
     ed to sing, particularly when laid low by the hand of his father,
     the mighty Fingal.
                        III.-POPULATION.
         Of the parish of Barvas, as at present constituted, the popula-
     tion cannot be correctly ascertained previous to the year 1821.
     Every census formerly taken included the district of Cross, now
     detached. The earliest on record thus taken of Barvas and Cross
     together was Dr Webster's in 1755, when the population was
     1995; by the former Statistical Account, the number of souls then
     was 2006. In 1821, it was 2568; and in 1831 it amounted to
     3011. The population of Barvas alone, since the disjunction, will
     in twenty years more, at its present rate of increase, equal that of
     both parishes, as stated by Dr Webster, or, in other words, in one
     century will be nearly doubled. This rapid increase arises from
     a general inclination to marry young-from the want of any outlet
     for the superabundant population by emigration or otherwise,-and
     from the numerous subdivisions of lots consequent on this accumu-
     lation.
