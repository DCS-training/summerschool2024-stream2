     of Carnock.

     NUMBER XL.

     PARISH OF CARNOCK.

     (County and Synod of File-Presbytery of Dumfermline.)

     By the Rev. Mr. ALEXANDER THOMSON.

     Origin of the Name.

   IT is not known, when, either the parish, or the village
from which it is denominated, received the name of
Carnock.  But it is probable, that this happened at the time
When the Gaelic was the prevailing language in the Lowlands
of Scotland.  In that language, the words Cair, or Cairn,
and Knock, (of which Carnock is supposed to be a compound),
signify a Village, or Collection of Houses adjoining to a small
bill, which is very expressive of its situation.  The adjoining
eminence of Carneil Hill seems to have been the spot where a
battle was once fought, probably during the time of the Da-
nish invasion, in 1039, or 1042*; and perhaps derived its
name (Cairn-Neil) from one of the chieftains who fell on that
occasion.
