to shoes; 95 in making boots and shoes for exportation, and
200 in supplying the consumption of the town.  The value
of boots and shoes exported may be about 4385 L.  As the
demand for tanned leather has, for some years, greatly increas-
ed, considerable difficulty is found in procuring raw hides,
and the price of oak bark is doubled.  This business is upon
the increase.  Two new enterprising and active companies
have of late engaged in it, so that probably it will be more
than doubled.
   Two companies are engaged in manufacturing cordage of
all kinds for shipping, and ropes for all the various uses of
the country.  They employ about 30 persons, and they also
carry on the whole business of ship-chandlers.  Soap was some

foolish attempts to undersell their richer English neighbours.
It may here be mentioned, as an article of curiosity, that soap
making was an art known in Dundee as far back as the

   Within there 3 or 4 years, the manufacture of glass has been
introduced, and the company engaged in it have erected two
glass-houses; one for bottles, and the other for the white kinds
of window glass.  They employ in the business 100 persons,
and last year it yielded to government a duty of 3046 L.  Ma-
ny persons are also employed in manufacturing tobacco and
snuff; and one company is engaged in a sugar house, but of its
