     of Crossmichael

Some drowers turn from L. 30,000 to L. 35,000 per annum.
With respect to other provisions, this parish does more than
supply itself.  At Dumfries there to a ready market for fat,
swine, which are bought up and cured for the use of the,
English.  Some barley, and a very great quantity of oats and
oat-meal, are annually sent by land carriage to New Galloway
and Damellington, to supply the moor country, and still
greater quantities are shipped at the foot of the Urr and the
Dee, for Liverpool, Whithaven, and the manufacturing towns
in Lanark and Renfrewshire.  Hares and partridges abound
here, and they are even increasing, although none of our he-
ritors are so attached to the game laws as to make an annual
publications in the newspapers, of their determined purpose
to become the avengers of blood on the iniquitous generation
of poachers.

   Roads.-About a mile of the great military road (made by
government) from the English border to Portpatrick, passes
through the footh end of this parish.  Some years ago, the
statute labour was converted by act of parliament.  The in-
habitants of this district pay at present the maximum, which
is 15 s.  Sterling for each L. 100 Scots valuation.  Several
good lines of road have been fixed on, and some of them are
about half made.  There is still much room, for improve-
ment.  there are no turnpikes in this, or in the neighbour-
ing county of Wigton.  Turnpike roads would be very ac-
ceptable, if the ceremony of collecting money at the toll bars
could be dispensed with.  It is doubted how far they would
be expedient on any other terms.  If they shall take place,
manures ought otbe exempted, and a very moderate tax
should be laid on cattle, where the trade in them is carried
on to so great an extent.
