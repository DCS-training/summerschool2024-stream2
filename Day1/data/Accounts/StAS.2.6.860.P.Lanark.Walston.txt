              Amount of population in  1755,  -  479
                                       1791,  -  427

was 488.  Of these, 89 reside in the village of Walston, and 196
in the village of Elsrickle; the remainder in the country.
   There are five proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50
and upwards.
   The number of families in the parish is 102, and the number of
inhabited houses the same.
   The favourite games of the district are quoits and curling, in
which this parish can boast of its fair proportion of good players.
   The people, on the whole, enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the com-
forts and advantages of society; are moral and religious, and con-
tented with their situation and circumstances.
   The population comprehends, I cattle-dealer, I gamekeeper,
1 carrier, 2 surface-men, 1 toll-keeper, 1 innkeeper, 1 mason, 1
stocking-weaver, 1 cooper, 4 shoemakers, 3 tailors, 1 carpenter,
3 smiths, and 31 weavers, and there are employed in agriculture

is now referred to in the Church Courts, as a precedent for refusing translation un-
der particular circumstances.  To those better acquainted with it, however, it affords
such a proof of factious opposition to a meritorious minister, as to establish that the
people may err in their opposition, as well as patrons in their selection.  Indeed it
form counterpoise to the case already alluded to in Walston, and if the parish of
Walston feels at this day the effiects of the one.  the parish of Dunsyre has been
thought to be still labouring under the consequences of the other.  The factious op-
ponents of Mr Molleson's translation to that parish, after being worsted in the Pres-
bytery synod, where the case was thoroughly understood. obtained a victory in the
General Assembly, where its specialties could not be so well known, and the pa-
rishioners of Dunsyre at this day can best tell what thanks are due to those who re-
sisted the settlemen of Mr Molleson among them.
