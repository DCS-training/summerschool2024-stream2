in its immediate neighbourhood.  Peats and pit-coal are
the common fuel; the latter is obtained in plenty from no

barley has been found to answer as an article of crop.  The
inhabitants are, in general, a stout, healthy, cleanly, good-
looking people, not ill educated, and still impressed with a
great and serious respect for the ordinances of religion.

   Markets and Roads.-The nearest market towns are, Ayr,
Irvine, Kilmarnock, and Mauchlin.  The cross roads are
numerous, well laid, and kept in good condition; but with
this disadvantage, that they are conducted without any dis-
tinction, indifferently up heights, and down into hollows.
Ayrshire, abounding in coal and limestone, demanded for
the conveyance of these, good roads, at a time when, in other

   Minister and School, etc.-The present parish minister of
Tarbolton is the Reverend Mr Ritchie.  The church is in
a decent condition.  A new manse has just been built for
the present incumbent.  The value of the benefice does
not exceed L. 150 a-year, nor yet fall greatly short of it.
The parishioners, from the highest to the lowest, give a
decent and diligent attendance at church.  The parish
schoolmaster's emoluments may be about L. 50 a-year,
Latin, arithmetic, writing, the reading of English, are taught
in the school.
