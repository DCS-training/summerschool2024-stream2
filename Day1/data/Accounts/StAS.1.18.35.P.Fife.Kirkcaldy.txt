from the Highlands of Scotland.  At that time the average
price, including freight and carriage, was about L. 5: 10 per
ton.  But British bark having within the last 3 or 4 years
advanced almost to double the former price, (from L. 8 to
L. 10) it has since been found necessary to import a great
proportion of what is used here, from Germany and the Ne-
therlands.  The leather, which is of all the usual denomina-
tions, viz. bend, crop, shoe-hides, cordovan, saddler's lea-
ther, etc. is sold in the neighbouring towns and country, in
the north of Scotland, in Perth, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and
occasionally in London.  The annual sales have for some
years produced at an average from L. 7000 to L. 8000.  The
duties paid on this branch produce annually about L. 470.
The wages of a tanner, which are nearly double to what
they were 30 years ago, run in the week from 6 s. to
10 s; those of an industrious currier will average 15 s.

   Cotton-spinning.-The spinning of cotton, chiefly for woof,
has been carried on here for 8 or 9 years; and till this year
with considerable success.  In 1792, 110 hands, reckoning
men, women, and children, were employed in the town;
besides those who were employed by manufacturers of this
parish, in the neighbourhood.-At present, the number is
reduced to 75. These prepare and spin about 1100 lbs. of
cotton in the week, or about 57,000 lbs. in the year.  This
quantity is spun into 32,000 spindles of yarn; which at the
average price of 4 s. per spindle, yields L. 6400.  The yarn is
spun on the common jenny; of which instrument 29 are em-
ployed.  The carding is performed on cylinder cards, moved
by horses.  The weekly wages paid to the whole hands em-
ployed amount to L. 12.
   Before this year, a considerable quantity of the yarn spun
here was sent to Perth, to be wrought into callicoes.  At
