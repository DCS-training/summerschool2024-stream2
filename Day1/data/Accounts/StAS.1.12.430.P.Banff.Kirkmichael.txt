try, in general, exhibits a bleak and gloomy appearance.  In
crossing the centre of it, few cheering objects attract the eye
of the traveller.  From detached hills covered with heath,
and destitute of verdure, where here and there a lonely tree
marks the depredations of time, he naturally turns with a-
version.  But, should he happen to pass after a heavy fall of
rain, when the numerous brooks that intersect the country
pour their troubled streams into the roaring Avon, he must
commiserate the condition of the inhabitants, at such a sea-
son, precluded from the rest of the world, and even from en-
joying the society of each other.  Frequently in winter, the
snow lies so deep, that the communication between it and
other countries, becomes almost impracticable.  The banks
of the Avon, however, are pleasant enough, and in different
places tufted with groves of birch, mixed with some alder.
This being the largest stream that waters the country, from
its source to where it fall into the Spey (the Tuessis* of An-
toninus's Itinerary), it flows over a space of 24 or 25 miles,
including its windings.  In the parish, there are 2 other lesser
streams, besides a variety of brooks; the one called Conlas,
from cuthin, narrow, and glas, green, and the other, ailnac,
from eil, a rock, and nidh, to wash.

   Climate.-From its elevated situation, the numerous brooks
by which it is intersected, and its vicinity to the Grampian
mountains, it might naturally be expected, that the atmo-
sphere of this country has little to recommend it.  Of this,
the inhabitants have sufficient experience.  Their winters are
always cold and severe, while their summers are seldom warm

<FOOTNOTE>

*Tuessis, from Tuath, north, and uisg, water, by way of eminence, being
the largest river in the N. of Scotland, it was afterward called Spey, from
Spadha, a long stride, in allusion to the length of its course.
