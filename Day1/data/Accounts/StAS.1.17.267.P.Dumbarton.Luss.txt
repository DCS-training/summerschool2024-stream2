   Roads, Ale-houses, etc.-The roads have of late been much
attended to, and are at present in good repair.  In the 1786,
an act of Parliament was obtained for converting the statute
labour of this county into money, which has had good ef-
fects.-There are 9 licensed ale and whisky houses, and one
inn.  Four years ago there were 5 licensed stills for distil-
ling whisky; now there is but one of 36 gallons.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The principal disadvanta-
ges, under which this parish labours, are the great expence
of fuel, the scarcity of natural manures, and the high price
of labour, and of every necessary of life, owing to the neigh-
bourhood of so many great manufacturing concerns; but
that neighbourhood, on the other hand, is a great advantage
to such as have any articles to dispose of.

   Hints for Improvements.-Woods in general, and oak
woods in particular, are now become valuable every where,
and especially upon the banks of Lochlomond.  Whatever,
therefore, relates to their improvement, must be well wor-
thy the attention of every proprietor.  An acre of oak wood
here, at an average, is worth from 10 s. to 12 s. a year;
which is a much greater return than could be had from as
much ground of equal quality in any other way whatever.-
The first great object to be attended to, is the inclosing the
great body of the wood with a sufficient stone dyke.  The
temporary wooden fence, which is commonly raised round it
every time it is cut, seldom lasts above 4 years, and often a-
mounts to one third, sometimes to one half the expence of a
stone wall.  The wood thus inclosed should, as soon as cir-
cumstances wilt permit, be taken entirely into the proprie-
tor's hands, whose interest it will be to encourage the natu-
ral growth of oak, ash, holly, and other valuable timber, and
