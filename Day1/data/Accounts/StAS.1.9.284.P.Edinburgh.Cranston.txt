of land runs from 5 s. to 30 s. an acre, and a few fields of
good quality are let so high as L. 2 the acre.  A mildew
infects the banks of the Tyne from Cranston to Pencait-
land, and sometimes does material damage to wheat and
oats.  The lands about Ormiston generally suffer more
than any other part of the tract where it prevails.  The
rent of the parish is about L. 2800 Sterling, and the va-
lued rent is L. 6208: 1: 4 Scots.  The rent of the smallest
farm is L. 35, and of the greater L 300*.

   Population, etc.-The population, according to Dr
Webster's report, was 725.  From an exact survey made
in the 1792, the number of souls amounted to 839; males,
376, females, 463.  After extracting 3 different periods
from the parish register, the number of births stood as fol-
lows: from 1715 to 1726, the males were 112, and the
females 144, total 256; from 1739 to 1750, the males
were 106, and the females 111, total 217; and from 1779
to 1790, the males were 90, and the females 95, total 185.
The average of male births, therefore, for the space of 30
years, is somewhat more than 10, of female more than 11,
and of both, nearly 22 yearly.  From this extract, how-
ever, it would not be a just conclusion to infer, that the
number of births, and consequently the population, has
been on the decrease; because every year, on account of
the secession, the neglect or poverty of parents, several
births are omitted to be inserted in the parish register.
The average of marriages, for the space of 10 years, a-
mounted to 8, but the register where they are inserted has
not been kept with any exactness.  There are 3 villages
