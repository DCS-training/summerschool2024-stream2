their families, keep a few good milch cows near them; and a
very few substantial tacksmen raise all the good cows which are
now sent to market.  The great proportion of cattle that ap-
pear in market are stinted in growth, by the bad management
of the farmer.  There scraggy impoverished beasts are picked
up by the monopolizers already mentioned; they are turned
for a season upon the desolate land; and, in process of time,
become somewhat better; when they are turned off to make
way for a new fleece.  Cattle, properly pastured, bring at an
average L. 5 a head at market; but there impoverished and
stinted cows never exceed the price of L. 3: 10.-Were the
monopolizers restricted to one, or two farms at most, it would
in a great measure cure this evil, and would, at any rate,
be the cause of rearing better cattle, and in greater numbers.
   The people employed in cultivating the ground are general-
ly in indigent circumstances; but farmers and day-labourers ne-
ver enjoyed better times.  The most of the young men go to the
buss-fishing for one half of the year, and return with good wa-
ges: such as stay at home at day-labour receive between 1 s.
and 14 d. per day.
   The produce of the parish consists of oats, bear, and pota-
toes, black-cattle, sheep, and horses.  The rent is above L. 3000
sterling.  In the year 1765, it did not amount to much more
than one-half of this sum.
   The number of tenements are 61;-of black-cattle 1200;-
of sheep 1400;-and of horses 200.  The quantity of grain
raised annually is considerable.-The heritors arc 12 in
number.

   Stipend, Poor, and Population.-The tiends of the parish a-
mount to 262 bolls of victual, and L. 18 sterling of money:
out of which the incumbent receives 72 bolls of victual,
