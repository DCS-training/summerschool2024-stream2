cent rocks.  The lands on Loch-laggan side, though higher,
and lying in a still wetter climate than that of the valley in
the center of the parish, yield a surer crop, being less liable
to frosts and mildews, owing to their lying on a stratum of
lime.  The climate here is very variable; every two ot three
miles makes a sensible difference; and it rains on the one
side of the river, when it is dry on the other.  It is the high-
est and most island parish in Scotland.

   Produce.-The vegetable produce is oats and barley, rye,
and potatoes.  The ground on the river side, if allowed to
remain out of culture 7 years, yields excellent crops of black
and white oats, without any manure.  When prepared for
barley, it requires a very great quantity of compost manure.
The nubmer of black cattle in the parish may probably be
computed at about 1600.  The ground is laboured by hor-
ses, generally of the country breed, of a middling size, and
very hardy.  In former times, it was usual ot send many of 
them to market; but now the parish hardly raises a sufficient
number for labouring the ground, owing to the introduction
of sheep, and consequently the advanced value of hill-grass.
The average quantity of meal made in the parish, in ordi-
nary good years, is 2450 bolls; but the crop of 1782 did
not exceed 850 bolls.  The sheep-farms in this parish are
not above four or five.  These sheep-farms at present sup-
port about 12,000.  The other farms, on which there are a
mixture of black cattle, sheep, and horses, will not support
above 2000 sheep.  In whole, there are about 20,000 sheep
in the parish.  People in general judge it more profitable to
reduce their number of black cattle, and, as much as pos-
sible, to increase their sheep.  The best and largest wedders
sell from 12 to 15 or 16 s.; and an ordinary wedder, of the 
smallest kind, which the general run of tenantry rear, sells
