having it removed to pave the way for the improvement of the
Lochar moss. It is hoped, that these will lead to more solid ad-
vantages than have accured from former surveys. A very able
one was made by Smeaton in the year 1754; but, from some cause
or other, it evaporated in speculation. It is also in contemplation,
to form a road through the moss between Glencaple quay and the
Annan road, where it passes Mousewald kirk. Except about a
mile near Caerlaverock manse, and a small rise on the Mousewald
side of about half a mile, the rest of the road would be a dead level.
The execution of this projected improvement would be of great
advantage to Caerlaverock, and the country on the Mousewald side,
more especially as a wooden jetty is projected, lower down the Nith,
for the benefit of the steamers, and other vessels, which, from their
burden, cannot, at all states of the tide, make Glencaple quay.
The expense of this would be about L. 200, and it is likely to be
soon effected. The mail between Dumfries and Annan used far
as it lies in this parish, is still tolerably good, and has lately re-
ceived considerable repairs; but after it enters Ruthwell, all traces
of a road have been nearly obliterated by the invasions of the Sol-
way. Were a new road made from Bankend bridge to Annan,
and the other improvements alluded to also executed we would
have little to complain of, in respect of roads. The road to Dum-
fries from Glencaple, which runs along the banks of the Nith, is
nearly level, and in tolerable repair.
