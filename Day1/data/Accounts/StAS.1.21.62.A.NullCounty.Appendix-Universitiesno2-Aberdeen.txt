     Statistical Account of the

   Regents in Arts.-The six students in theology were elec-
ted by the three doctors above mentioned, the sub-principal,
grammarian and regents, and admitted by the principal.
These students were elected tanto tempore quod ad doctoratus
gradum in eadem facultate valeant promoveri, quod erat ad sex an-
nos tantum; after which they were to remove and make way
for others.  The founder appointed such a number of them
as should be chosen by the Principal and sub-principal, ad re-
gentiam in artibus.  After a trial of somewhat more than 30
years, this perpetually changing set of teachers in the arts
was found exceedingly inconvenient; few of the students in
divinity made such progress during the prescribed term of six
years, as to be found qualified for the degree of D. D.; and
besides, the time of continuance of the regency was considered
to be so short, that when one set had accomplished their
course, others could not be found to succeed them.  These
inconveniences having been represented to Pope Paul the
Third, by William Stewart, bishop of Aberdeen, his Holi-
ness, by a breve indulti, anno 1538, prorogued the term of six
years; and allowed these regents and students in theology to
continue to reside in the college, and exercise their functions,
until others were found willing and fit to succeed them, and
as long as the bishop of Aberdeen for the time should think
proper.  We shall see afterwards in what manner these regu-
lations of the Pope tended to introduce the present perma-
nent establishment of the regents.

   Duty of Sub-Principal and Regents.-The sub-principal and
regents were to instruct their scholars in the liberal sciences,
in the manner practised by the regents in the university of
Paris.  The branches taught were logic, philosophy and me-
taphysics.
