                   I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   PRIOR to the year 1650, the parishes, now named as above,
were annexed to the neighbouring parishes of Lochgoilhead and
Inverchaolain,-Strachur to the former and Stralachlan to the latter.
   Name.-The ancient name of Strachur was Kilmaglass, sig-
nifying the burying ground of Maglass, (Macgklais) or Grey's-
on, who was the saint honoured with the religious devotions of
the inhabitants of this locality.  Stralachlan means the Strath of
Lachlan, and derived its name, as is said, from that of the princi-
pal heritor of that district,-Maclachlan, or Lachlan's son. T he
remains of a castle of some antiquity still exist.  Stralachlan was
formerly called Kilmorrie, from Kil and Muire, the Virgin Mary-
   Extent, &c.-The parish as such lies longitudinally from north-
east and south-west. Its length is 19 miles: its breadth varies
from 6 miles to about 3.  Its boundaries on the east and north-
east are the united parishes of Lochgoilhead and Kilmun; the
south, those of Kilmun and Dunoon, and the parish of Kilmodam;
on the west and north-west, Lochfine.
