     Statistical Account

There is a Magbiehill pea, procured by the Lord Chief Ba-
ron's father.  The pease crop is always precarious at Linton.

   The land under the plough in Linton parish may amount
to 700 or 800 acres, of which two-thirds may be outfield*.

   The outfield is teathed by folding the black cattle in sum-
mer over night, to keep them from the corns, and by folding
the ewes when they are milked.  The folds are sometimes
limed in October, after the cattle are housed:  The land is
then ploughed; the lime falls to the bottom of the furrow,
but is brought up again by ploughing deeper next season.
Three crops of oats is reckoned moderate cropping after a fold.
On new limed solds some farmers take four oat crops, then a
crop of pease, which will grow on outfield after lime, though
not otherwise, then another crop of oats:  The land is then 
left to gather fod as nature shall direct.  Twenty bolls of
shells, or at most twenty-four, is the dose for an acre.

   The croft land+ is variously treated.  The approved ro-
tation introduced by James McDougal is a rotation of four,
viz, turnips with dung; then barley or Magbiehill oats sown
with grasses; then a crop of hay; then Magbiehill oats.  If
the turnips are eaten on the field by sheep, this still farther
enriches the land; so that, in all probability, at the next go-
ing over, half the dung might be sufficient to raise a good
turnip crop, and set the rotation agoing.  The spare dung
might be employed in converting some of the outfield into 
croft.  Under this rotation of four, potatoes are raised in
stripes through the turnip field; so that the land is dunged
and paddled by the sheep which eat the turnip.
