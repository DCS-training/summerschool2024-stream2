     The Statistical Account

739. it is probable a great steeple stood in the middle of
the cross: the view of the ruins seems to confirm this.
   The floor of the body had been of tile, and the windows
of baked glass.  Pieces of both are yet dug up amongst the
rubbish.  The side aisles are paved with stone; yet seen, on
digging.  There is still so much standing of the edifice, as
will shew the exact dimensions both as to the height, and
form, and great variety of pilasters, carving, and other orna-
ments.  Close by the church, near to the east end, stands
tile charter or chapter house.  The lower part is a fine vault,
entering from the church, and probably served for a vestry;
above which there has been a square room, the roof long
since taken off, where it may be supposed, from the name,
the abbot and convent kept their chapterly meetings.  This
work is very strong, and closely built.  To the west of the
great entry of the church is the abbey gate, in form not un-
like that at Edinburgh, but less; the walls above mostly
standing: and west from that, on the south-west corner, are
the walls of the regality prison, which have been very strong,
having below two vaults, one above the other.  Besides all
these, there is now standing, and inhabited, but in bad re-
pair, a part of the abbot's lodgings, with the vestiges of all
the other buildings, which composed several square courts,
close by.
   The Earl of is heritable baillie of the regality.  His
deputes keep the head courts in the gate of the monastery,
and their ordinary courts in the new church.  He is not
in use of exercising any civil jurisdiction, nor of judging of
riots within the town; although, in crimes of moment, that
are tried by juries, or that subject the criminals to great fines,
lie doth.
