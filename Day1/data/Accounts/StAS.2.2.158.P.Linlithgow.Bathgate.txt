scription, "Here lies the body of James Davie, who was shot at
Blackdub, April 1673, by Heron, for his adhering to the word of
God and Scotland's covenanted work of Reformation, in opposi-
tion to Popery, Prelacy, perjury, and tyranny."
   Eminent Men.-Dr Fleming, the celebrated naturalist, and
now Professor of Natural Philosophy in King's College, Aberdeen,
is a native of this parish.
   Land-owners.-The chief land-owners are the Earl of Hope-
toun; Colonel Swindel Norval of Boghall; Mr Marjoribanks of
Marjoribanks; Mr Hart of Kirkton; Captain Sandilands of Cous-
ton, &c.
   Parochial Registers.-The registers of this parish are somewhat
voluminous. They had been well kept, except about the com-
mencement of the present century. Portions, however, have been
lost. The register of births begins in 1672, and, with a blank
between 1684 and 1687, and another between 1694 and 1721,
continues to the present time. The register of proclamations
also begins in 1672, and is perfect with the omission of but two
years to 1767; from that date to 1789, a record is possessed only
for six years; from 1789, the register is complete. The register
of deaths begins 1698, and continues to 1710. From 1710 to
1769, a record is preserved only for eighteen scattered years.
From 1769, the register is complete. Of the Records of the
Kirk-session's Actings, Vol. 1. embraces the period from 1633
to 1645, and from 1647 to 1650; Vol. ii. from 1672 to 1689.
In other three volumes, the record is complete from 1694 to
1792. From that year to 1820, only some loose scrolls of mi-
nutes are in existence; but from 1820 to this day they are com-
plete.
   Antiquities.-"Near Bathgate," says Penney, * " are me-
moriat remains of Druid worship." The writer of this notice
gives the statement as be finds it, but does not know to what it
refers.  In the stone coffins already referred to, some copper
coin's were found.  There have also been turned up, in different
arts of the parish, coins of Edward L, Queen Elizabeth, and
Charles IL
   Modem Building.- Building goes on steadily in the town of
Bathgate. The principal recent buildings are the, Academy, a
distillery, brewery, and gas-work.  Freestone, either from the
