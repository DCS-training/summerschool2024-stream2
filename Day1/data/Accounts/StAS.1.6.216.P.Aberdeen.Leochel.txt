the flourishing state of manufactures at Aberdeen, which draw
off many people from this and the neighbouring parishes.

   Manufactures.-The knitting of worsted stockings is the
principal manufacture of this parish.  It is carried on by
almost all the women, by many boys, and several old men.
-Different manufacturers from Aberdeen bring out wool,
and give the people from 1 s. to 3 s. for spinning the wool
