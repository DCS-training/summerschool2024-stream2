sea trouts are likewise killed in it, from 2 lib.  to 4 lib.  weight.
And, in the season, salmon are caught from 5 lib.  to 20 lib.
About 20 or 30 years ago, salmon were found in Dovan in
great plenty; but, from the illegal and murderous manner of
killing them with spears, at an improper season, their num-
bers of late have greately decreased. As there are but few
or none killed now, but by gentlemen in the way of sport,
or by some of the poorer sort of the people, for the use of
their families, the prices cannot well be ascertained.

   Bridges.-There was a very good stone bridge over the
Dovan nearly opposite to the church; but some years ago it
was carried down by a flood. At present, a wooden bridge is
about to be put over it, near the same place, by the volun-
tary subscriptions of a few public-spirited persons in the
neighbourhood; which will be of very great convenience
to the people in this place, particularly upon the sabbath;
as many of the parishioners have to cross the Dovan in their
way to church.  The want of a bridge would not have been
felt so much here 20 or 30 years ago, as the people in this
place were very expert at crossing the river on stilts.+ And
there are still some who cross it in this way.  But since the
time that the bridge was built, this practice has been gene-

   Climate and Diseases.-The air in this place is remarkably
pure and healthy; the country being free and open, neither

++These stilts were two branches of a tree, of a proper strength, with a
cleft or small branch preserved in each, of a sufficient wideness to receive a
person's foot, about 18 or 20 inches from the root end. Upon which the
person being mounted, with a foot on each cleft or projecting branch, and the
top or small end of the stilt in each hand, they stalked through the river at
the fords. This they called stilting.
