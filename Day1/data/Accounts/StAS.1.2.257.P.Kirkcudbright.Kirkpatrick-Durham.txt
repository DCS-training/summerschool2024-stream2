intention of this society is to provide a source of relief for the
sick, and the old, for widows, and orphans.  The system on
which the society proceeds, is this;-every member, at his en-
trance, pays down as 6d.-and, as long as he continues a member, 
he gives in 6d. every month, which is added to the general
stock.  This money, under fixed and public regulations, is
distributed by the office-bearers of the society, to such as are
found to be proper objects of relief; and the office bearers,
who are annually elected, are responsible for their manage-
ment, during the continuance of their office. Societies of this
description are becoming frequent in different parts of the coun-
try, and they seem to deserve encouragement;-because the
delicacy of the human feelings will be less hurt, when supplies
are received from a source of this kind, than when received
from the ordinary sources of charity:  and likewife they will
tend, in a great measure, to supersede, at least in this part of
the island, the necessity of other charitable institutions; and to
prevent the existence of those heavy taxes for the relief of the
poor, which are so much, and, on some accounts, perhaps, so
justly complained of, in the southern part of the united king-
dom.

   Fair and Races.-There is an annual fair in the parish, on
the last Thursday of March.  It is held in the village before
mentioned; and in the afternoon, when the busines of the
day is mostly concluded, foot races, and other diversions, are
exhibited, for the entertainment of those who chuse to attend
them.  This fair has increased most remarkably for the last 5
years; and if the manufacturies, which are begun this years,
should have any tolerable degree of success, it is probable that
they will still increase more and more.  About 4 years ago,
a course was prepared, in a field adjoining to the village, for
sorse  races, which have regularly taken palce every year since
