the Sabbath; and farmers, with their wives and servants,
convened in parties for drinking, fighting, and scolding, on
the Lord's clay during divine worship.  Such irregularities
would now cause horror.

   Disadvantages-One disadvantage under which this parish
formerly laboured, was the want of opportunities of giving
their children education, from the inconvenient form and
circumstances of the place.  That is now remedied, to a cer-
tain extent, by a school appointed under the Society for pro-
pagating Christian Knowledge, (whose institutions are produ-
cing admirable effects), above two years ago in one quarter,
and by a private school established since, by the aid of one of
the proprietors, in another.  The encouragement of the pa-
rish schoolmaster is pitiful, and, from the alteration of cir-
cumstances, in no respect what it was originally intended to
be.  Another disadvantage, which probably never can be re-
medied, so far as to render this corner the seat of any exten-
sive manufacture, is scarcity of fuel.  The mosses are gene-
rally steep, and far distant; and the labour of preparing and
carrying home peat, etc, is excessive; and even these are
nearly exhausted.  Montrose, the sea-port town, is distant
about 12 miles, which greatly enhances the price of coals.
The proposal, however, to remove the coasting duty, is a
most gracious and seasonable motion, and, we may hope, will
contribute, with other circumstances likely to happen, to al-
low that useful article at a reasonable rate.  Other fuel is
turf, cut from the muirs, and broom, which is of service,
while the improvements in agriculture allow any to remain.

   Poor.-The number of poor, upon an average of the last
6 years, is 12.  The average of the sum distributed to them
for the same period, 18 L.  The session funds arise, in part,
