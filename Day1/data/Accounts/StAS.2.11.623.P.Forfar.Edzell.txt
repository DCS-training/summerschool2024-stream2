the building. Tradition reports, that this tower was built and in-
habited by a family of the name of Stirling, from whom it descend-
ed by marriage to the Lindsays of Glenesk.  The round tower
on the north, and the other parts of the castle, appear to have been
built at different periods after it came into the Lindsay family."
  Edzell was one of the mansions or castles which Oliver Crom-
well, in 1651, occupied with a garrison. It ceased to be a resi-
dence in 1714 or 1715, when its owner left it. It was partially
occupied in March or April 1746, by Colonel John Campbell,
then a very young man (afterwards the late venerable John Duke
of Argyle), whose duty it was to skirt along the braes with the
Argyle Highlanders, while Duke William marched north through
the heart of the country.
  At Colmellie, on the base of Mount Batteck, are two so-called
Druidical circles, one with a portico or entrance, enclosing an
area of 45 feet by 36, the other less.  At Dalbog there was
another circle, of which only one stone is now standing.

                    III.--POPULATION.
         The population in 1791 was        963
                           1801,          1012
                           1811,          1057
                           1821,          1043
                           1831,           974
                           1841,          1076

   Toward the end of seventeenth century, the population
would seem to have been much as now. In 1684, and several
years after, the baptisms appear to be regularly inserted, and the
number was much as it is now,-24 per annum.
   Proprietors.-There are two proprietors, neither of them resi-
dent: Lord Panmure, who has six-sevenths, and John Gladstone,
Esq. of Fasque, who has one-seventh, being that part of the pa-
rish in Kincardineshire, formerly a parish by itself, called New
Dosk, and to which a burying-ground is still attached.

                           IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Planting.-Under wood there are about 200 acres (imperial.)
About 90 acres, chiefly larch, was planted about forty-two years
ago, and is now yielding profit.
   About 1060 imperial acres am wastes, yielding little pasture.
Perhaps one-third is improvable. There are about forty-six
square miles of hill, all within this parish, chiefly brown heath,
with occasional more kindly patches from water springs, or allu-
vial soil.
