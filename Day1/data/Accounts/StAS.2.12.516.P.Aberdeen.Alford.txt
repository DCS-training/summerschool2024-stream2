manufactures and commerce is brought together in immense mas-
ses, that powerfully strike the senses, and its magnitude is readily
allowed.  That of agriculture is dispersed, in relatively small
parts, over an immense extent of surface; and the total amount,
although, including the value of the land, it vastly outweighs that
of all other real capital, is too often overlooked by the statesman
and political economist.
   In the following table, the value of the cattle is deduced from
a careful determination of the average value of some stocks, by
persons of competent skill ; the prime cost of the horses in the
same manner; the value of the farm-steadings is ascertained by
some which are of the common construction, recently valued by
arbitration; that of the fences by the common well-establisbed
rate; and that of the machines, implements, harness, &c. by in.
quiries of the original makers.
