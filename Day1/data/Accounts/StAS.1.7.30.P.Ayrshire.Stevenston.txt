three years, and rest six.  But, if they choose to manure as
inclosure every third year with a specified quantity of dung,
they may continue to plow it as long as they please.  Of
their own accord they lay down all the ground they rest with
grass-seeds, chiefly rye-grass, the seed of which they have
themselves, raising tolerable good crops of it on every kind
of ground.  The clovers, especially the red, does not suit their
particular kind of clay; not that it is too strong, but there is
something in the soil adverse to it, which no manure nor cul-
tivation can conquer.  On the loams, the gravelly, and even
the pure sandy soil, there are crops of grasses railed abundantly
rich and luxurious.  The farmers pay their rents chiefly from
the dairy.  The turnip husbandry is never attempted, for a
reason easily guessed at.

   Oats is the principal grain which they sow.  It covers,
perhaps, three fourths of their plowed ground.  On the rest
they have bears or barley, and beans, fown at the usual times.
For ten years past, the farmers and proprietors have begun
to sow a little wheat, under the disadvantage of being obliged
to carry it 14 and 18 miles to a market.  This is in part re-
moved, by wheat mills erected nearer them.  In consequence
of the very superior profit of this grain on our dry grounds,
the wheat culture is increasing every year.  It is seldom or
never fown here after a thorough Summer fallow, but after
a potatoe fallow, the rows of the potatoes four feet distant,
the spaces between them plowed four or five times, from the
beginning, of June to the beginning or middle of August,
when the rows become luxuriant, and begin to unite.  This,
besides the preparatory plowings and dressing of the ground
in the Spring.  They use, for fallowing and planting the
potatoes, a small plough of the Scotch form, drawn by a sin-
gle horse.  Another practice they have very lately learned,
