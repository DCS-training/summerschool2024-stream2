           It cannot be said that there is any distemper, disease, or species
        of rickness peculiar to this parish, and we may regard it rather as
        remarkable for health and longevity than otherwise.  Several of the
        parishioners have, from time to time, attained very advanced ages,
        one of whom, a female, died in the month of August last, in the hun-
        dredth year of her age.  It may not be improper to notice here a
        fact, which we consider worthy of record, namely, that in the year
        1832, when that scourge of the human race, cholera, was permitted
        to visit this country, and to commit its mournful devastations in
        some of the neighbouring parishes, the inhabitants of this parish
        were not only mercifully preserved from that direful visitation, but
        the mortality here that year did not much exceed the half of the
        average annual mortality for the seven years immediately preced-
        ing, or for that of the four years that have since elapsed.
           Meteorology.-The prevailing winds are from the W. and S. W.,
        and it is from these points we have the greatest quantity of rain.
        We have also occasionally very heavy rains from the east, and in the
        spring months we have frequently cold and stormy weather from
        that quarter.  A register of the weather has been regularly kept
        here for many years, at an elevation of about 300 feet above the
        level of the sea, from which we have constructed the following

           Hydrography.-The Almond which is a bold and rapid cur-
        rent, though it intersects a portion of the parish at Lynedoch, is
        rather a boundary to this parish than a river belonging to it.  It
        takes its rise among the hills which lie between Loch Earn and
        Loch Tay.  It winds its way through the steep and rugged moun-
        tains of Glenalmond, receiving in its course the numerous tribu-
        tary streams which descend, through the extensive tract of Logie-
        almond, from the hills on the north,-passes this parish,-becomes
