   Wild Animals.-There are hares, rabbits, and some foxes
in the parish.  We have the swallow, the wood-cock, the
cuckoo, and other migratory birds, in their seasons.  Part-
ridges have not been so numerous for some years as they
formerly were.  The moor-cock and hen are natives, and in

fuel used in almost every family.

last season.  Oatmeal sold at 2 s. 8 d. a stone, of 17 1/2 lbs.; yet
none that the writer knows of were in danger of perishing
for want.  The meal is now selling at 2 s. the stone, and the
price is expected to be still lower, as there has not been, per-

and barley, in this part of the country, than the present,
which, within the bounds of the parish is now [October 21.]
almost gathered in, and in excellent order.

   Character, etc.-The inhabitants of Westerkirk have long
been remarked for decency and regularity of conduct.  They
are, in general, religious without superstition, and charitable
without ostentation, and temperate almost without exception.
None of the poor are reduced to the necessity of begging
bread: in what they receive from the parish, and what they
