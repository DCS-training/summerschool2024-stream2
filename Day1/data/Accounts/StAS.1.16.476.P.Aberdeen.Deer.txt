     Statistical Account

   In the south-west side of the parish, there is abundance
of that species of quartz called felt-spar, or rombic quartz,
both above and below the surface of the ground.  The
late Mr Garden of Troup, to whom the estate belonged on
which it is found in greatest plenty, sent a specimen of it
to a glasshouse in Newcastle, which was approved of, and
a considerable quantity was in consequence exported; but
the expence of land-carriage, or some other cause, soon put
a stop to this branch of commerce*.
   Pieces of crystalized quartz are likewise met with occa-
sionally; the purest in the form of regular hexagonal
prisms, pointed at the ends.
   A dark blue, and a very white granite, are the stones
most used in building.

   Church, Poor, and School.-A commodious church, suf-
ficient to contain 1400 persons, was built in the year 1789,
for L. 700 Sterling.  The stipend may be valued at L. 80
Sterling.  The glebe measures 29 1/2 acres nearly; the
greatest part of it good land.   Mr Basil Anderson is the
present incumbent.  The crown is patron.
   There is a Seceding meeting-house in the parish, and an
English Episcopal chapel, where most of the gentry in the
parish and neighbourhood attend.  There are 29 men and
47 women presently upon the poors list+, who receive from
6 s. to L. 2 each per annum, in small sums quarterly.  The

   +In the year 1751, as appears by a minute of the session, the number
of poor on the list was 31, and the yearly collections did not then exceed
L. 46, 16 s. Scots, of which L. 28, 4 s. went for clerk and officer's fees.
Yet so much was this at that time accounted, that a scheme for maintain-
ing the poor in their own houses, by assessments on the heritors and te-
nants, was unanimously rejected by the session, one principal reason being,
that it would reduce the ordinary collections to a trifle.
