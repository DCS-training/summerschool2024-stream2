     of Moulin.

Ardle, formed by the junction of the two last mentioned
streams.  These two divisions of the parish, are separated
from each other, by a hill of inconsiderable height, and about
four miles over.  They lie in a direction nearly parallel to
each other.  The Strathardle division extends in length
about 7 miles from N. W. to S. E. and in breadth 6 1/2 miles.
The length of the Atholl division, from N. W. TO S. E. is
7 miles, its breadth varies from 4 to 6 miles.

   Soil, Climate, and Diseases.-The greater part of the pa-
rish is mountainous, with several high and abrupt preci-
pices, though there are no mountains of extraordinary
heigh.  The hills are almost wholly covered with heath.
Those of Glenbriarachan and Glenfernat, yield the most
grass; affording pasture for several flocks of sheep.  The
arable land is, in general, sloping, but not very steep.-In
the Atholl district the soil is tolerably deep and fertile.
The fields round the village of Moulin, a space of a mile
and a half long, and half a mile broad, are among the most
fertile in the Highlands of Perthshire; the soil in the
Strathardle district is shallower, and yields lighter crops.
The air is  dry and extremely heathy.
   Chronical distempers are very rare.  Sudden cold or heat,
or violent exercise, sometimes occasions fevers.  The itch,
which used to be very frequent, has, in a great measure, dis-
appeared, owing, chiefly, to cleanliness of clothing.  Des-
tructive epidemical distempers are also extremely rare.  In-
oculation for the small-pox, which is beginning to be practi-
sed among the lower classes, is almost always successful, in
preventing the fatal effects of that disease.
