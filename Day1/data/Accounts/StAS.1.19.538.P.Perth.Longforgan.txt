pose, which he will find a much better plan for agricultural
economy, than letting the crop remain longer upon the
ground to ripen the seed.

   Clover Seed.-It has been attempted to grow clover for
seed in this parish, but not with such success as to encou-
rage the experiment.  For this purpose, to have it as pure
as possible, the first crop was early cut, that every other
vegetable, which had a chance of seeding with the clover,
might be destroyed.  The second crop then was to give
the seed:  But this made it often too late in the season for
ripening; and after all, the difficulty of separating the seed
from the husk was exceedingly discouraging.  Whether the
threshing-mill would do this more effectually, remains to
be tried.

   Winning Hay.-It is a common practice in this country,
after their hay is cut, to let it lie for several days in the
swarth, as it is called, without touching it; the only rea-
son given for which is, that it will turn a shower in that
state better than when teased out, and left open upon the
field.  The least reflection may convince any one, that this
is both false reasoning, and bad practice.  The great ob-
ject in making hay, is to dry it as quickly as possible, with
all its native juices in it; and the most obvious method for
this purpose is, not to let it rest one moment after it is cut
down, but to continue turning and turning it constantly till
dry; and if it should get a shower during this operation,
when lying loose and open, the rain will pass through it, and
be soon dried up by a succeeding breeze and fun; and, at any
rate, there is every probable chance of coiling, i.e. putting it
in cocks, or getting it stacked in safety sooner by these means
than otherwise.  It is well known, that rain destroys the na-
tive juices of every plant, if exposed to it for any time; and
when hay is suffered to lie in the swarth, that part of it
