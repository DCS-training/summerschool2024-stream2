  Ale-houses.-There is a nice inn in the parish, kept by the fer-
ryman at Erskine ferry, and, in addition, there are no less than
five public-houses in the parish, one or two nf which are by no
means well conducted. In a country parish such as this, the prac-
tice of licensing any one who applies to the quarter sessions, with
a certificate from a justice of peace, without requiring from the
kirk-session a certificate of moral character, is felt to be an into-
lerable nuisance.
   Fuel.--The fuel chiefly used is coal and peat. The latter is
cut in this and the neighbouring parish of Inchinnan, in the moss
belonging to Messrs Maxwell of Dargavel, and Alexander of
Southbar, and is partially used both by cottars and others; but
coal is also used in every house, however poor, and is sold at 9d.
per cwt. There is no coal fit for use to be had nearer than
Paisley, but, as the Glasgow coal is equally cheap and of a better
quality, it is generally preferred.

                  MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
  Since the last Statistical Account was written, there has been
a decrease in the number of public- houses to the amount of three,
and there is certainly much less drinking now among the inhabi-
tants than formerly. Since then, however, it is matter of deep re-
gret, that family worship, formerly almost universal in the parish,
has been very much neglected, or discontinued, and that the num-
ber of illegitimate births has been on the increase, while the pledge
of marriage usually given in such cases is rarely redeemed. The
scenes of drunkenness, Sabbath profanation, and horrid blasphe-
my, with which an unsophisticated country population has been fa-
miliarized, by a residence among them of the very worst descrip-
tion of English, Irish, and Highlanders, to the amount of 1500 or
2000 persons employed on the railway, for the last two years, have
been productive of the most blighting and pernicious effects, both
on old and young, which it is to be feared, in many cases, will never
be fully eradicated.
