for nineteen years.  That abject servitude, formerly so pre-
valent, was evidently contrary to honest industry and real im-
provement.  While such a system prevailed, it was much
against the interest of a good husbandman to improve his
farm, as if he did another offered a higher rent, or grassum
for it, and reaped the fruit of his labours and exertion.

   Rents.-The tenants pay their rents partly in money and
partly in kind, as in grains, lambs, cocks, hens, chickens,
eggs, etc.  Proprietors, whose tenants go to the fishing,
generally get a small present of fish on their coming from
sea, since what was called katerfish has been abolished.  The
old iniquitous feudal practice, by which the landlord thought
himself entitled to take the heriel horse from a poor widow,
on the death of her husband, is now unknown.  The rent
of the best arable land here is from 10 s. 6 d. to 15 s, per
acre.  In addition to the usual rent, fines, or what is here
called boads, grassums, or entry money, are sometimes ex-
acted.-There are only 9 heritors in the parish, the great-
er proportion of whom are non-resident.

   Tacksmen.-There are about seven principal tacksmen, or
great farmers, in the parish, who hold leases of the proprie-
tors at stipulated rents, and who exact from the subtenants
and cotters the rents and services that would otherwise be
payable to the proprietors.  But sometimes the landlord, in-
stead of letting his estate to a tacksman, keeps it in his own
hands, and manages a part of it, called the Mains, by an over-
seer and servants, with the assistance of the tenants and cot-
ters*.
