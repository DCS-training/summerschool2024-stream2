at large, exposed to all the severities of hunger and cold, to
the depredations of ravenous birds of various sorts, especially
carrion crows and eagles, to dogs which here abound, and to
thieves of the human kind more ravenous and destructive
than any of them.  The breed is so puny, that 5 s. is consi-
dered as no bad price for a sheep fit for the knife in autumn.
Few of them have any horns; their faces are white or grey,
and their tails are remarkably short;-they bear at a medium
a merk, or a pound and a half of excellent wool, which is
valued here at little more than 6 d. and from the best infor-
mation, they seem to be the same kind with the sheep in
Shetland.  Notwithstanding their want of food and of being
tended, and all the disadvantages under which they labour,
they are much more prolific than those in almost any other
part of the kingdom.  Two lambs at a birth is common,
three we may sometimes meet with, and if the pasture be but

which is sometimes the case, the mothers have milk suffi-

pleasant; and of such of them as are compelled by hunger or
led by custom to feed upon sea-ware, the carcase is black and
dry, and when cooked the taste of the mutton somewhat resem-
bles venison.  A fact respecting these animals, which is as
well vouched as it is curious, must here be mentioned.  In
the little uninhabited islands, or holms as they are called,
which are here in considerable numbers, sheep, especially
ewes, are put where they remain the whole year for pasture.
If in the spring about lambing time, any person goes into the
island with a dog, or even without one, the ewes suddenly
take fright, and through the influence of fear it is imagined,
instantly drop down as dead as if their brains had been
pierced through with a musket bullet.  Such as die in this
