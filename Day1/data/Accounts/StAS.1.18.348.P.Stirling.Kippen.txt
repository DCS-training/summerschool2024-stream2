crops on these high grounds are seldom adequate to the la-
bour and expence bestowed upon them.  What shall we
think of the situation of that land, and of those who labour
it, from which an increase in the proportion of 3 to 1 is
reckoned an excellent crop?  The inferiority of the oats and
barley produced on such grounds, is also experienced both
at the mill and market.  It would certainly be better if
more of the higher part of the dryfield were thrown into
grass.  If the tillage indeed were altogether abandoned, these
lands in a short time would be overgrown with heath or
broom.  But this might easily be prevented by occasional
cropping.
   It would be a great improvement to drain those fields
which are most injured by water.  In some places indeed
the rock comes so near the surface, that such a measure is
impraticable.  But in many places it might be adopted
with great advantage.  So extensive an undetaking however
could hardly be carried on by ordinary tenants on a 19 years
lease.  It would therefore be the interest of the proprietors
to give them some proper encouragement.  A laudable ex-
ample of this kind is set by Mr Stirling of Garden, who
agrees to be at the expence of casting the ditches, and the
tenants are bound to fill them up with stones.  Wherever
this improvement is attempted, care should be taken that the
ditches be of sufficient depth.  They ought to be 3 feet deep,
and filled with stones as near the surface as that the plough
cannot touch them.
   Too little attention is paid in general, to a proper rotation
of crops.  The dryfield cannot well bear more than two white
crops successively.  Those therefore who go on to take three
or four, certainly impoverish their grounds.  A greater pro-
portion of the farm should be laid down in grass, and other
green crops occasionally interposed.  This will be more at-
