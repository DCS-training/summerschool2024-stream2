and ordinary education, yet possess a degree of judgement and
knowledge, both in spiritual and temporal matters, exceeded
by few.  They enjoy life very happily, and are seemingly
pleased with their situation.  Till of late years, their dwelling
houses were very uncomfortable; but now they are making
great improvements in them, particularly when they receive
any assistance from their landlords to excite, or to enable
them.  One great bar to improvement is the shortness of lea-
ses.  They are seldom given for more than nineteen years;
and, in many cases, (where the lands are strictly entailed)
cannot be granted for a greater lenght of time.  This affords
but little scope, and less encouragement, to extensive or ex-
pensive exertions.

the purpose of carrying manure, etc. particularly one up the
river Dusk, to join the shire of Ayr to that of Wigton, and

*In the planning, and the laying out of the public roads, very
great improvements have taken place, in this neighbourhood.-
The road from Girvan, down the north side of the water of Stirr-

Knockdolian hill, to the bridge of Ballantrae, is in a line of six-
teen English miles, through a hilly country, and yet so conducted
that there is not a single pull in the whole of it; whilst, at the
same time, it is carried through a most beautiful country, diversi-
fied with wood and water, hill and glen, and every species of sce-
nery, that can delight the eye of a traveller.
