nister, no less than 23 persons have been lost between Dul-
cy bridge and the post-road.  The loss of lives from this
cause claims attention; and the only method that can be
pointed out, to prevent it, is to erect a bridge between the
two boats, which would render the communications both
safe and easy.  This parish is a hilly mountainous district,
covered with heath, and furnishes little of any other kind
of pasture.  There is much wood in it, consisting of firs,
birch, and what is called weeping birch, alder, hazel, ash
and some oaks.  The birch, alder and ash are manufactu-

white oats, Scotch bear, rye and potatoes.  The soil seems
to be unfit for any other kinds, being shallow and thin,
covered with stone, with a hard gravelly bottom.  There
is seldom above the third return, and the crop is much ex-
posed to the frost.  It is supposed lime might improve the soil;
but the tennants are in general so poor, that they cannot af-
ford the expence of it.  Attempts have been made to dis-
cover limestone within the parish, without sucess.  The
method of labouring seems to have undergone little altera-
tion for centuries back.  The farmers use the small Scotch
plough, drawn by 4 or 6 black cattle, and a small horfes  
or by 4 horfes and 4 black cattle. From the most accurate
accounts, there are about 300 horses, 1000 black cattle,
and 2000 sheep, of the small Scotch breed; a larger kind
of those last have been tried, but is generally thought a
