terest is distributed, at particular seasons of the year, among
the poor at large, belonging to this parish.  The family
of Hedderwick, mortified a small sum to the poor at large,
both in the town and country parish, and another to pur-
chase for the poor in the country parish, Bibles and New
Testaments.

   The sailor's box is not rich, as many of the mariners
scruple to pay the dues.  It affords, however, to the widows,
-etc. of such as are connected with it, occasional supplies to
pay house rent, buy coals, etc.  Shipwreked sailors, tra-
velling to their own homes, if their story is judged to be
genuine, may also expect some charity from this fund.
   The trades funds were formerly considerable; but some
years ago, they were more than exhausted by a ruinous
law-suit.  By persevering economy, and some donations,
they are at present emerging out of debt.
   As, notwithstanding all these funds, and the generosity of
many individuals, there are some poor persons, belonging
to Montrose, who could not sublift without applying to the
public at large; the magistrates, and church-session, meet at
a particular time of the year, and give out badges to such
as they know to be under the necessity of begging.  These
licensed beggars go through the town the first day of every
month, but are not allowed to beg at any other time, nor
to go beyond the bounds of the parish.  They are sup-
plied so liberally, that they receive nothing from any of
the public funds, except when lying on a sick-bed.  Their
number, at present, is about 40.
   At the same time, as idleness is very pernicious to mo-
rals, especially to the morals of the youth, the council and
church-session give a monthly pension to some orphans, and
other poor children, to restrain them from begging, to 
which they would otherwise be obliged to have recourse.
