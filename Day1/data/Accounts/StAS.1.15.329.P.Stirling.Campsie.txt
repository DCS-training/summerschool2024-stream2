ble depth; then slate, which, at a medium, is from seven to
eight feet in thickness; after which, there is uniformly lime-
stone, being a seam of four feet; then a slate, and then the
coal:  Such is the regular strata in Campsie in sinking for
coal; with this difference, however, that the slate in the North
of Glazert, betwixt the lime and coal, is fifteen feet in thick-
ness; on the South, it is scarcely four; below the coals there
is eighteen inches of a stuff, which the workmen term dalk;
then the white lime, of an inferior quality to the otheir, and
as yet but seldom wrought.
   The coal in this district is full of irregularities, stiled by
the workmen coups, and hitches, and dykes; the truth is, the
coal partakes a good deal of the irregularity of the ground
above, which is very uneven.  If one was to speak in gener-
al terms of the whole coal in the parish, as one fields it might
be said, that the depth was to the South East, and the rise
to the North West; such really being the ascent and declivi-
ty of the lands in this district;-but as there are a number
of gentle swells in the strath, it will happen, that according
as the pit is put down on this side of the swell, or upon the
other side, the dip and rise of the coal will appear favourable,
or the contary.-The dip is sometimes so sudden as to be
one foot in three, in other places, only one in twenty.  Besi-
des these coups and hitches, which are found where the stra-
ta above and below the coal suddenly approach, or retreat
from each other, by this means couping the coal out of its
regular bed, there are complete breaks in the strata, termed
dykes, which cut off the coal entirely in various directions;
these dykes are sometimes observed upon the surface of the
earth, from which they sink down to an unfathomable
depth;-There are two of these dykes in this district, which
are remarkable, and seem to be uniform throughout:  First,
There is a coup-dyke, which runs from West to East; North
