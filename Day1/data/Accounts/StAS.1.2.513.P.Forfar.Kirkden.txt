   Fuel.-This parish, and the neigbourhood, bring most of their
fuel from Arbroath.  The cart load of coals, (72 stones), costs
generally 6 s 8 d. besides carriage; yet this is our cheapest, as
well as best fuel, for there is little peat in this neighbourhood,
and none in this parish.

   Roads and Bridges-The roads have, till last year, been
made by the statute labour, which was, long ago, found alto-
gether insufficent, for making and keeping them in good re-
pair.  The labour of one parish was often carried out of it,
to make a road in another, while the roads, within the parish
itself, were exceedingly bad.

   In 1970, an act of parliament was obtained, to raise mo-
ney by turnpikes, for making certain county roads, therein
laid down.  In this act, the statute labour is converted into
money, at the rate of L 1 :4, sterling, on the L. 100 Scots of
valued rent, to be raised yearly, till the parish roads are made.
By this act, no money can be levied in one parish, to make
the roads of another.
   The turnpike act met with considerable opposition, before
it was carried in the county; as most improvements do in their
infancy; and there are still grumblers: But the gentlemen
now seem all agreed; and the most respectable farmers ac-
knowledge, that turnpikes must be a great advantage in this
county, where roads were formerly, at no time good, and, in
winter, were so deep, as to be almost entirely unpassable.

   Antiquities.-A plain in the parish of Kirkden, between the
Finnyand the Lunan, seems, in day, of yore, to have been often
a field of blood.  There is an obelink in it; and many Roman
urns, with bones in them, have, at different times, been dug
up.  The obelink is niched into a large stone.  There are on
it, some imperfect figures of horses etc.  It is supposed by
