at L. 200, and others at L. 100 a-year; but in general they
are between L. 20 and L. 30.  It seems, however, to be the
plan of the heritors in general, as soon as the present leases
expire, to convert several small farms into one large one.
A third part, at least, of all the grounds in the parish are
enclosed, and the advantages of enclosures, where the
grounds can be watered, ae universally acknowledged.
Hedge and ditch are generally made use of, though stone
sence are found to be the only substantial enclosure.
Ploughing here is performed altogether by horses; light
two-horse ploughts, with iron heads, and cast mould-boards,
prevail universally; and carts drawn by two horses are gi-
ving plae to those drawn by one.  Frew black cattle are
reared in the parish; and no sheep are bred, except for fa-
mily use, but the farmers generally breed what horses they
have occasion for.  The instruments employed in husbandry
have been much improved of late, the farmers being ready
to copy after the most approved models.  Few cottagers
are employed; the labour is mostly carried on by servants
living in the farmers's house, who are looked upon as less
expensive and more disinterested than those who have fa-
milies of their own.  There are 144 ploughs in the parish,
and a proportional number of carts.  Wheat is sown gene-
rally in September and October, and reapead in August and
September thereafter; barley is sown in May, and reaped
in August and Septermber; oats and pease are sown is; 
March and April, and reaped in September and October:
potatoes are planted in April, and taken up in September
and October; turnip are sown about the middle of June.
Corns are reaped about 10 days earlier by the side of the
river than in the upoer part of the parish*.
