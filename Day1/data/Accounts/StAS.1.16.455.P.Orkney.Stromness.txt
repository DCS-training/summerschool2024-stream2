     of Sandwick and Stromness.

   Roads.-There are no made roads through these parishes
but one of two miles in length, which leads from the vil-
lage of Stromness towards the road that leads to the bo-
rough of Kirkwall.  The roads through the parish of Sand-
wick are naturally good, as the ground is dry.  The roads
through the parish of Stromness are, for the most part, bad
in winter, as the grounds are wet.  In one or two places
the roads are scarcely passable on horseback; and although
the inhabitants of two or three parishes must pass by these
bad roads, in carrying the produce of their farms to sale at
the village of Stromness, yet it has never been attempted
to make these roads better; although this might be done
at no great expence of labour.

   Bridges.-There is only one bridge, and that in the pa-
rish of Stromness, at the entrance to the loch of Stenness,
where it communicates with the sea.  This bridge may be
about 100 or 150 yards; it has no arches, but instead of
these, logs of wood are laid across 3 or 4 openings, through
which the sea passes.  It is thought by some, that if the
ground was cleared, a salmon-fishery might be here esta-
blished.

   Millstones.-There is a millstone quarry on the west
coast of the parish of Sandwick, out of which about 10
millstones are wrought annually, at the price of 2 s. for
each inch that the stone is thick in the eye.  From this
quarry most of the mills in the county are supplied.

   Slates.-There is a slate quarry in the south-west extre-
mity of the parish of Stromness, from which from 30,000
to 40,000 slates are annually sold.  They are strong, thick,
and large, last long, and are the best in this county.  They
might be wrought in greater quantity were labourers to be
