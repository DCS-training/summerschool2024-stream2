when newly built, but, after long exposure to the weather, it as-
sumes a dingy grey appearance.  Any attempts that have been made
to employ it for finer purposes have not been attended with success,
as it is too soft to admit of a very high polish.  On the south-west
of the hill, the serpentine crops out in masses of considerable
height, having, at a distance, the appearance of the ruins of old
castles.  On the western extremity, asbestos is found in abundance,
lying on the surface of the different eminences.  Upon the whole,
the mountains of this parish are much inferior in picturesque effect
and rugged outline to the sister district of the head of the Dee.
   Meteorology.-No regular account has ever been kept, so far as
is known, of the meteorology of this district; but it may be men-
tioned that the highest temperature, indicated by the thermometer
within the observation of the writer, during the last seven years,
was 83&deg;, Fahrenheit in the shade, on the 7th July 1833, and he
has been informed, on unquestionable authority, that in 1826, at
Auchernach, it stood at 90/d in the shade.  On the 14th February
(1838), at 8 o'clock P. M., it stood at 8&deg; below zerp, or 40&deg; below
the freezing point. *  No storm of such severity has been known
since 1814, as that in the beginning of the year 1838, which con-
tinued from the 8th of January, with only partial mitigation of
rigour, till the 19th of April.
   The range of the barometer is extensive.  On the 29th Novem-
ber 1838, it fell to 27.50 ; and on the 7th January 1839 to 27.20.
The highest point reached, that we have observed, is 30.50, on
the 10th April 1839.  It is subject to very rapid depression and
elevation, rising or falling sometimes three-fourths, or a whole
inch in twelve or twenty-four hours ; and hence it would
prove a fallacious guide to trust, irrespective of contingent, cir-
cumstances, to the rising and falling of the barometer as an index

<FOOTNOTE>The writer has not a self-registering thermometer, and may not have observed
the lowest degree of temperature that occurred during this very severe storm.  It is
unnecessary to give the temperature of every day, but it is worthy of notice that the
thermometer did not average higher than 24/d at 8 o'clock a. m. from the 15th January
to the end of February.  The following are some of the more escessive degrees of
cold that were remarked, viz.
