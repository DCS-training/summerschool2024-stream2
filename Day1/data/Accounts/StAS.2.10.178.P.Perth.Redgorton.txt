                Ancient Manners.-For a long time after the Reformation, so-
               ciety was in a state of disorder, the contemplation of which is apt
               to fill us with profound astonishment.  The corruption of manners,
               which the depravity of the Popish clergy bad introduced, and coun-
               tenanced, was not so speedily reformed as the errors of their faith;
               and for more than a hundred years after the introduction of Pres-
               bytery, not only the immoralities of drunkenness and debauchery,
               but the grosser and more enormous crimes of adultery, incest, as-
               sault, and Murder, prevailed to an almost incredible exte                  -nt. The
               criminal law against these crimes seems neither to have been regu-
               larly nor vigorously enforced, and the correction or punishment of
               them seems to have been left, in a great measure, to the church.
               The records of our Presbytery, which extend back to 1619, teem
               with such enormities, and present us with strong pictures of the
               corruption of manners,-tbe defective administration of the law,-
               and the ancient power of the clergy.  There are two instances of
               this kind, connected with this parish, which are so extraordinary in
               their nature as to deserve to be recorded.  In 1620, Harry Shaw
               of Pitmurthly, made an assault upon Mr Ynung, his minister, an
               apd and infirm man, because behad executed a summons against
               him, by direction of the Presbytery, 11 pursuit him," as the record
               says, "I invadit him to the danger of his life, having in his handw
               ane rung, with ane long dirk or else ane dalger; and, although the
               poor, old man repeatedly called for mercy, made him *war that he
               would never speak of him before the Presbytery, or by the blood of
               Jesus he should instantly die."  Yet the only punishment inflicted
               for dastardly and cruel assault was, that he should appear in
                                                        4
