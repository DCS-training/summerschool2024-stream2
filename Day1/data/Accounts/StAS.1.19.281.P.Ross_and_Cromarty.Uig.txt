and synod of Glenelg.  The length of the parish is ten com-
puted miles, not including the wide entry of Loch Roag,
which runs into the heart of the parish from the westward;
its breadth is nine miles.  The interior part of it is hilly,
much more so than any of the other parishes in the island,
and along the shore it is almost flat.  In many of the farms
along the sea-coast the soil is sandy; farther back, it is of
a thin light kind, mixed with a little clay, and a great
part of it seems to be the last stratum of moss which has
been cut away for fuel, and which produces forced crops,
with the assistance of sea-weed for manure.  The air is moist,
and healthy to the inhabitants.  The most prevailing distem-
pers are rheumatism, erysipelas, cholics, and epilepsy among
infants from the fifth to the eighth day after their birth;
if they are not affected with the disease before the eighth
day, they are not afterwards subject to it.  The surgeon in
this country declares, that the last-mentioned distemper
proved fatal in every case which came within the compre-
hension of his knowledge, two only excepted, in which
the surgeon attended.  One of the children which escaped,
suffered so much from the violent exertions of the muscles,
during the continuance of the fits, that its arms and legs
are distorted, and the whole frame is in a debilitated state,
and likely to continue so.  It is worthy of remark, that
the infants of such parents as come to this island from the
neighbouring continent or islands, or from any part of Bri-
tain, are not troubled with this affliction, until such parents
reside for many years in this country; and indeed few of
them are at all troubled with it.  This distemper prevails
over all the island.  This parish abounds with small lakes, but
somewhat inferior in taste and flavour to those on the main-
land.  There are four rivulets in which salmon are caught
in small quantities, and used by the inhabitants.  The
