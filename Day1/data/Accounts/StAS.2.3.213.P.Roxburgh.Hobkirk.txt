   The enlargement of farms has been the principal cause of the
late decrease of population,--conjoined with emigration to manu-
facturing towns, and even to foreign countries.
   There is no town, and nothing that can properly be called a vil-
lage, within the parish.

  During the last three years there have been six illegitimate births
in the parish.
  Poaching, especially the snaring of game, prevails to a conside-
rable extent.  Smuggling and illicit distilling are not now practised.
                        IV.--INDUSTRY.
  The estimate hazarded above gives about 19,000 acres for the
area of the parish ; of these, 3400 are in tillage or laid out in grass
parks.  There may be 860 acres in plantations, mostly in a
very thriving condition.  Those towards the upper part are suffi-
ciently thinned and regularly tended; those in the lower part
are sadly neglected, though in many places excellent timber
might be felled with great advantage to the remainder.  We
have already mentioned that firs, beeches, and oaks, succeed best
in this soil.  Admirable specimens of these may be seen at Wells,
Weens, and Greenriver.  More recently, ash, elm, birch, &c. have
been mingled; but few of these have as ydt attained great value.
  Rent, &c.--The average rent of land may be 15s., and none is
let so high as L.2 per acre. The average sum paid for grazing a
three year-old ox or cow L. 6; a two-year old L. 4; a hill sheep,
5s. 6d., infield do. 12s.
