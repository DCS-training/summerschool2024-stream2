sion, and the church-yard surrounded with a good stone and
lime wall, and coped with free stone.  The manse was part-
ly new built, and partly enlarged, in 1729, and has had two
or three repairs since that time; but it is still rather a cold
uncomfortable dwelling.  The number of heritors is 8; of 
whom only 2, of small property, reside in the parish.

   State of the Poor.-The poor receiving alms are only 5;
who are supported, partly, by weekly collections, which,
with small fines exacted from delinquents, and dues paid for
marriages and baptisms out of the church, amount, annually,
to L. 14 or L. 15, and partly by alms, in meal and other
victuals, given them from house to house, or sent to them
when unable to go about the parish.  There are no legacies
or mortifications, nor as yet is there any need of them.

   In extraordinary cases of distress, we have a custom which
deserves to be taken notice of in a paper of this kind; and
that is, when any of the lower people happen to be re-
duced by sickness, losses, or misfortunes of any kind, a
friend is sent to as many of their neighbours as they think
needful, to invite them to what they call a drinking.  This
drinking consists in a little small beer, with a bit of bread and
cheese, and sometimes a small glass of brandy or whisky, pre-
viously provided by the needy persons, or their friends.  The
guests convene at the time appointed, and, after collecting a
shilling a piece, and sometimes more, they divert themselves
for about a couple of hours, with music and dancing, and
then go home.  Such as cannot attend themselves, usually send
their charitable contribution by any neighbour that chooses
to go.  These meetings sometimes produce 5, 6, or 7 pounds,
to the needy person or family.
