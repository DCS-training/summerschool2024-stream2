	The great subdivision of land, and consequent want of capital,
with deficiency of fuel, are the chief obstacles to the improvement
of the parish. Should the search for coals in Hoddam parish prove
successful, and as much of the land of this parish change hands,
as has been the case within these few years, improvements will go
on rapidly. It is by the rapid change of property, and the conse-
quent introduction of capital, that the cultivation of the p`rish has
gone on so progressively.
	The average gross amount of raw produce yearly raised in the
parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows:
