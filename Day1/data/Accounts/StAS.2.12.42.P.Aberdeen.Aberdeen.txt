the instructions given in the schools, the sympathies of the people
will be enlisted in their favour; and the teachers will be sustained
by knowing that the ministers and eldes take a lively interest in
their success.
   The following is an abstract of returns which were made in
1883 to queries issued by the Magistrates and Council, with a
view to ascertain the state of education in Aberdeen.  In these re-
turns, all sorts of schools were embraced.  Various changes have,
to be sure, taken place since that time, and allowance must be
made for those pupils who attend, at the same time, two or more
schools for different branches, as well as for those who, living in
Old Aberdeen, attend schools in town, and vice versa; but taking
it as a whole, it may be looked on as giving a pretty accurate view
of the present state of education in Aberdeen: Schools, 37;
teachers, 49; pupils, 3664; males, 2546; females, 1118.
   At the greater part of these schools, the fees vary from 2s. to
5s. a quarter.  Some, as already noticed, are free; and at others
scholars are occasionally taught without fees.
   The following abstract exhibits a view of the branches taught:
English, 2792; writing, 1887; arithmetic, 1567; Latin, 208;
Greek, 60; mathematics, 74; geography, 281; navigation, 15;
music, 333; elocution, 67; sewing, 429.  There is no return of
French and the other modern languages, because they are almost
exclusively taught by private teachers.
   Besides these, there are also week-day evening schools esta-
blished in a good many of the parishes, for the benefit of those
who cannot attend school during the day, and of these the follow-
ing return was made in 1833: Schools, 9; teachers, 16: scholars,
699; males 331; females, 368.
   An association was formed about two years ago, under the
title of "The Association of Teachers of Sabbath Schools, under
the Superintendence of the Kirk-Sessions of St Nicholas and Old
Machar" which promises to be-very useful, and which a few
months ago had in the parish of St Nicholas 19 schools with 149
teachers, and upwards of 1800 scholars; besides which, the Aber-
deen Gratis Sabbath School Society, which, has been in operation
for about forty years, has in the parish and neighbourbood, 20
schools, attended by about 100 scholars.

view to become schoolmasters may be trained in the knowledge
