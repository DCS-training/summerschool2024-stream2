lakes situated upon the north side of Ben-Uaish, affords abun-
dance of fine trout, though they are not of a large size.  There
is a small island near the south end of this lake, where it is
said one of the lairds of Fowlis had formerly a summer-
house.  Besides the trout taken in the rivers and lakes, there
are a good number of salmon caught on the sea coast,
sometimes by nets and cobles, called still fishing, but chief-
ly by means of yaires, or small inclosures, built in a curve or
semecircular form near the shore.  At high water the salmon
comes within these yaires, and at low water is easily taken,
having no way to escape.  This is the simplest and cheapest
mode of fishing that can be devised.  There are usually four
or five yaires kept up in the parish; and each proprietor
takes fish enough to supply himself and a few friends.  In a
a good fishing season he can send some to market.  Floun-
ders, herring-fry, or sprats, are frequently taken in these
yairs.

   Fossils, Miners, and Minerals.-In digging for peats in the
mosses of this parish, numbers of fir trees are found, which
afford a clear proof that those extensive tracts of ground were
once covered with trees, which must have added much to the
beauty of the country, and have been shelter to the cattle.
These trees that are dug out of the mosses are perfectly found.
and last long when applied to the purpose of building.  One
chief benefit derived fromt them is, that they burn well, and
afford excellent light to the country people, who cannot af-
fford to buy candles.  Clay and snell marl are to be found in
this parish.  The clay marl is met with in a moss called
Boginturie, upon the estate of Fowlis, 3 miles distant from 
the sea shore.  There is abundance of it; and it has answered
well with those who have tried it.  It will probably come in-
to more repute in proportion as the true notion of farming
