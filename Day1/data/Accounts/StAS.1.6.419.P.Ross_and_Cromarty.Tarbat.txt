then free of any brackish taste.  It gives the colour of iron
to the stones around it, and from this, and some other pro-
perties, is supposed to pass through an iron ore.  There are
different other mineral springs in the parish, having the
same qualities.-Small quantities of salt are found in the
summer months, concreted by the heat of the sun, from wa-
ter left by high tides, in hollow parts among the rocks.  The
situation of the parish, in an open part of the country, and ly-
ing on the sea, gives it a most extensive prospect.  There are
particular stations from which may be seen a part of eight
counties, with a long range of coast, from Cullen to Fort-
George, on the S. E. and S. and from Dunbeath and the Ord
of Caithness, to the Doun of Creech in Sutherland, on the
north.
   There are two public roads in the parish running parallel.
The one leads straight from Tarbat-Ness to the ferry of Cro-
marty, and is called the rock-head road, from its being carried
along the top of a bank, rising above the sea, and rocky in
some parts.  The other road passes by the church, through
the middle of the parish, and leads to the ferry of Invergor-
don.  There are cross roads also, one of which leads to Tain,
the head burgh of the county, where a weekly market is held,
to which the inhabitants resort.  In this and every parish through-
out the country, the roadspare made most convenient for travel-
lers, from the particular attention given to that branch of po-
lice.  The work has hitherto been performed by statute labour,
and the people have been regularly called upon, for repairing the
roads already made, or making new ones, where found necessary.
But a plan has lately been proposed, and approved, to have the
statute labour commuted, it being left optional to pay a certain
rate of money, or to perform the service in person, in terms
of the statute.
