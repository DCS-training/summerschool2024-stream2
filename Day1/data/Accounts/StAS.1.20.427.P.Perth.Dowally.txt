family have always, when in the country, honoured the public
examination with their presence; and so liberal has the col-
lection proved, that it has been abundantly adequate to the
object in view.  At the first of these examinations, which
took place about three months after the commencement of
the school, there were almost incredible proofs given of ap-
plication and memory.  Several of the scholars could re-
peat the whole book of Psalms, and the whole Paraphrases
and Translations, besides many chapters from the Old and
New Testaments.  Hitherto, indeed, it has continued to
flourish, with a success which has never been exceeded by
any similar establishment, and which reflects credit on the
teacher, the scholars, the parents, and the memory of Her
whose benevolence and piety gave rise to it.  The be-
nefit of such institutions in incalculable.

   3. Female School*.-This school, also, was instituted by
the late Jane, Duchess of Atholl.  Her Grace gave an annual
salary to a person properly qualified, to teach the different
branches of female education, such as sewing, tambouring,
etc. and paid the usual rates for a certain number of scho-
lars, whom she nominated.  The mistress, at the same time,
was allowed to receive and teach other scholars, additional
to these.  All of them continue the practice of reading a 
lesson in English daily.

     POOR.

   1. Number.-There are no begging poor belonging to the
parish; 17 receive a supply in their own houses, at the rate
of 6 d. or 1 s. weekly, in proportion to their necessities; and
occasionally not less than 50 partake of the benefit of the
funds.
