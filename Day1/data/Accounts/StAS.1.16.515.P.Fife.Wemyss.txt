hand-hoe their potatoes, and pay at the rate of L. 3 the
acre.  By this means the farmer procures a quantity of
good manure, has his ground well cleaned, and an excel-
lent crop of wheat or bear the following year.  The plough
used is Small's, which is drawn by two horses, and held
and managed by one man.  There are no sheep, but a few
kept by Colonel Wemyss for family-use, and they are of
a very fine kind.  There are 16 farms, which are rented
from L. 25 to upwards of L. 400 a-year.
   A considerable quantity of land near the coast is rented
by land-labourers, who reside in the villages, and though,
with many of them, farming is only a secondary object,
yet the land in general is well laboured, and produces good
crops.  Almost all sow some turnip for their cows in win-
ter, and feed their horses with potatoes, which are generally
boiled and mixed up with light corn.  The sea-weed, or
ware, which is driven in by the sea all along the shore,
makes excellent manure when spread immediately after it
is carried to the land.  This land, which is usually called
the Acre-land, lets from L. 1, 10 s. to L. 2, 15 s. the-acre.

   Plantations.-There is but little old wood, excepting
some at the castle of Wemyss.  The late proprietor, the
Hon. James Wemyss, Esq; inclosed a great part of the pa-
rish; some of it with stone and lime, and other parts with
ditches and hedge, and planted many thousands of trees
and his son, the present proprietor, is going on with the
same plan.  He has inclosed much, and for these 6 years
past has planted, of various kinds, upwards of 200,000 trees
every year, in different places.  All the plantations are in
a very thriving way, and in a few years will both warm
and greatly beautify the grounds.
