farms, and the lands they left being cast into allotments,
not agreeable, or not accommodated, to some of the re-
maining husbandmen, 4 or 5 of them are reported to 
have quitted their places; a diminution of the village
people so inconsiderable, as hardly deserves to be men-
tioned; especially when it is considered, that their room
would be supplied either by other tenants, or the ac-
count of their families equalled by the addition made to
the numbers of Mr. Hall's day-labourers, called groat
men; of which a considerable number was retained through-
out the year, for the purposes of ditching, hedging, and
fence-building, and other works carried on in the exten-
sive plantations of Whitehall.  The 2 other heritors,
who farmed their own estates, found it necessary, for
similar reasions, to keep their people about them; so
that, for a course of years, the village continued to have
nearly the same number of houses and inhabitants.  Nor
were these diminished by the present proprietor; who,
engaging in operations of husbandry, extended over al-
most the whole of his lands, required so many plough-
men, or hinds, and work people of several sorts, that
they and their families were not reckoned, at a gross
compensation, to be fewer than 90 or 100, kept up
during a currency of 10 or 12 years.  This circumstance
merits special attention, when we come now to give an 
account of the population of Chirnside, increased much
beyond what could be expected from any particular ad-
vantage in its local situation (excepting its salubrity, and
its free stone quarries), and surpassing that of any other
such village in the shire*.
