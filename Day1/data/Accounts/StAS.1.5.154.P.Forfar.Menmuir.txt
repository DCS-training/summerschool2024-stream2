lows in the battle of Brechin.  When the Earl of Craw-
ford sought in this engagement, to revenge Lord Dou-
glas's murder by James II. there was in this army one
Collace of Balnamoon.  This man being affronted at not re-
ceiving a promise of the lands of Fern from Crawford, on
their eventual victory, left him, while the combat was yet
doubtful, and brought over to Huntly and the loyalists
the best part of his commander's forces, consisting of battle-ax,
long spear, and broad sword men.  This turned the for-
tune of the day, and forms a very important fact in the
history of that time, as several writers acknowledge it was
a most critical event to James, and established the Crown,
which, till that decisive engagement, had only tottered on
his head.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The inhabitants of this pa-
rish are disposed to industry and economy.  The women,
in particular, spin a great deal of lint into coarse yarn for
the duck or sail-cloth factory.  They spin with both
hands, a practice little known in the south of Scotland,
which enable them to earn 3 s. a-week.  This makes it
sometimes difficult to get domestic servants, seeing they
can make their bread easily at home.  There are three
persons in this place who take in the flax undressed; one of
these keeps constantly two hecklers employed, to prepare
the lint for spinning; which, on being returned in yarn, is
carried to Montrose, as the few manufacturers who reside
here are principally employed in making coarse plaidings
and linen of a finer quality for home consumption.  The
roads are improving.  They are still made and repaired by
the stature labour, which is not commuted.  There are no
tolls, and the general idea is that they would be oppresive.
There are 2 bridges over the water called Cruick, on the
great road to Brechin.  One of these was built 3 years ago,
