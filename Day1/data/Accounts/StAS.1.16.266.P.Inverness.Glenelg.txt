dort by another arm of the sea, called Lochneavis, the pro-
perty of the family of Lovat.  The parish may be suppo-
sed to extend from N. to S. about 20 miles, and the same
number of miles from E. to W.  It is bounded on, the
N. E. and E. by the parish of Glensheal, county of Ross, a
ridge of hills making the division; on the S. E. and S. by
the out-skirts of the countries of Glengarry and Lochaber;
on the S. W. by the fresh water lake called Loch-morror,
this lake dividing the parish of Ardnumorechuan from that
of Glenelg; and on the N. W. by the navigable and much
frequented found that separates the island of Sky from the
continent of Great Britain.

each of which a river runs; the inhabitants reside in sepa-
rate villages on each side of the rivers; their arable land
extending along the banks, and on the declivity of the
hills; some of them also dwell on Lochurn-side.  In this
district the soil is good; part of a deep black loam, and
part of a sandy gravel, formerly the bed of the rivers,
yielding crops of potatoes and oats, and the hills afford good-
pasture for cattle.  In Knowdort the inhabitants dwell in
villages bordering on the sea, along the sides of Lochurn
and Lochneavis; here the soil is in general light, yielding
crops of barley, oats, and potatoes.  The hills, though high,
are mostly green to the top, and afford excellent pasture for
oil kinds of cattle.  North-morror is rocky and mountain-
ous, mostly adapted for cattle.
