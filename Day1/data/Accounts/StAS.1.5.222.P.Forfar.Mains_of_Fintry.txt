of the morthcloth, and a two-wheeled machine for carrying
the dead, which is sometimes let for hire; and from the in-
terest of a small mortification.  The schoolmaster's salary is
100 merks Scotch; the school wages are very small, and
of ill paid.  His whole living does not amount to above
L. 14 a-year.  Upon this he could not possibly subsist, were
it not for the encouragement he has for boarding.  It is
surely a pity, that such a useful class of men, who lay the

should be so shamefully neglected.  While the Legislature
is meliorating the situation of the clergy, surely the poor
schoolmasters ought not to be neglected.

   Agriculture and Produce.-Land here is rising in its
value, and is generally sold at 28 or 30 years pur-

They begin to sow about the latter end of March, and reap
in the months of September and October.  The rotation of
crops is 3 of grass, 1 of oats, and 1 of barley; then a green
crop, followed by a crop of oats, or barley sown with grass
feeds.  Sometimes, instead of the green crop, the land is
summer fallowed, and sown with wheat; after which the
ground is manured, and a crop of oats or barley taken.
The farmers find the artificial grasses to be very profitable, as
they fell very high, either on the ground or when turned
into hay.  It is very common to receive L. 5 the acre for
rye-grass and clover uncut, and 8 d. the stone when cut and
dried.  The cultivation of turnips, too, amply recompences
