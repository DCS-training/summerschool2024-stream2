the middle of June, and succeed well.  Turnip seed sown
here, whether in the gardens or fields, thrives well, and
gives large returns.  The seed is sown in May and June.
Rye-grass and clover seeds, from the luxurious crops pro-
duced, seem suited to this soil and climate, whether sown
alone or with/gram; although the latter method is found to
be most advantageous, as the stubble shelters the tender
plants from the inclemency of the seasons.

   Agriculture and Cattle.-Improvements in agriculture
are, at least, a century later than in the more southern coun-
ties of Scotland.  A plough with one stilt, corresponding to
the Italian, described by Virgil in his first Georgic, is gene-
rally used.

     Huic a stirpe pedes temo protentus in octo,
     Binae aures, duplici aptantur dentalia dorso.
     Caeditur et tilia ante jugo levis, altaque fagus,

   This very imperfect instrument for improvement, is drawn
by 4 horses, two and two a breast, and sometimes by three
a-breast, of the breed of horses from Strathnaver, and the 
ploughman carries it under his arm, around the end of the 
ridge.  A few two stilted ploughs in miniature, a saint i-
mitation of the old Scottish plough for tearing out leys,
are beginning to be used, but seldom on other occasions.
Harrows of two bulls, with wooden teeth, are drawn by an
ox or heiser.  Want of timber is a great bar to the progress
of improvement here.  Manure is carried in straw bas-
kets on horses backs, to the more distant fields, and to 
those higher, upon men and womens backs.  A few carts in
