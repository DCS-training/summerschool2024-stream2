April, and the three summer months; while in July 1828, rain.
fell on the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 12th, 13th, 14th,
18th, 20th, 21st, 24th, 26th, 28tb, 29th; and in August on the
3d, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 14th, 20th, 21st, 22d, 24th. It
thundered on the 5th, 8th, 12th. In September there were eight
rainy days, and in October six. It generally thunders about the
third Sunday of July,--a fact observable from neighbouring sacra-
ments, happening on that day, seldom passing without electrical
explosions.
	The wind, on an average of years, is 230 days in the west;
namely, about 55 days west, 55 north-west, and 120 south-west.
It is 110 days in the east, namely, 25 east, 50 north-east, and 35
south-east. It is seldom more than 25 days in the north and
south.
	Registers of the thermometer and barometer, kept here for three
years by Dr King, R. N. vary so little from those kept at Glas-
gow, and published in the Glasgow Medical Journal, that it is un-
necessary to give them a place. The barometer on an average
ranges between 30.53 and 28.73. The thermometer is seldom
above 75 in July, or below 15 in January. In the hottest days, in
a small room facing the north, it fluctuates between 65 and 70. In
mean monthly temperature, January is the lowest, namely, from 35
to 38, and July the highest, from 58 to 60. February and No-
vember are from 40 to 42; but November is the warmer of the
two. The same analogy holds between March and October, the
average heat being 45 to 47; but October is warmer than March.
April is seldom so warm as September, nor is May so warm as
August. The greatest heats and the heaviest rains are after the
longest day.
	From the above remarks, the reader will be enabled to form a
tolerably accurate idea of the climate. The air is in general re-
puted healthful; and the splendid scenery around affords abundant;
scope for pleasant and exhilarating excursions. Fogs are not fre-
quent, and rains less so than at some other places a few miles dis-
tant. Colds, consumption, fevers of different kinds, particularly
a slow nervous fever, to be afterwards described, fluxes, and inflam-
mation, in different forms, at times prevail here, as in other places
around. Gravel and other calculous complaints are on the decline;
but inflammations, palsy, and apoplexy, are supposed to be on the
increase,--probably from what is termed the improved mode of
living, and the more liberal use of ardent spirits and other stimu-
