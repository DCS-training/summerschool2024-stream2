     Statistical Account

   Agriculture.-There are about twelve large farms in
the parish, and what portion of each of them is not occu-
pied by the tacksman himself, is let to subtenants, who pay
to him, each person, from L. 1, 10s. to L. 3 of yearly rent,
and 12 days service.  Many of these sub-tenants are em-
ployed in fishing ling, which they sell to their masters at
5 d. each; engaging on board the herring-busses at L.1 per
month; in manufacturing kelp at L.1, 10s. per ton; and
working at road-making, and other labour, at 8 d. a-day.
By these means, and the produce of their lands, they are
enabled to pay their rents, and procure a tolerable subsist-

mossy, some black rich soil, and some light gravel, all lying
on a hard clay bottom, so very impenetrable, that a pike
will scarcely pierce it.  Rain can with difficulty enter into
it, by remains mixed with the soil, or runs over the sur-
face, till it be dried up in the spring season by the influence 
of the sun and wind.  To this cause, and the frequent hea-
vy rains, may be attributed the uncommon wetness and
coldness of the soil of this island, and the late spring and
harvest.  The plough made use of in general is an awk-
ward instrument, not unlike the Chinese plough, and de-
scribed already in this work by a clergyman in Orkney; 
but the principal tacksmen use the Scotch and English
ploughs, of which there will be a dozen in the parish.
Horse-loads are for the most part carried in small creels,
one on each side of the horse, and fixed by a rope to the
crook-saddle; but coup-carts, of which there are about 20
in the parish, are made use of by the gentlemen, and are
drawn by larger horses than those found in the parish. 
There is a general mode of turning the ground, called 
timid, or making lazy-beds, at which two persons are
employed on each side of the ridge; of these, two are cut-
ting, and two lifting the clods, which, to a stranger, will ap-
