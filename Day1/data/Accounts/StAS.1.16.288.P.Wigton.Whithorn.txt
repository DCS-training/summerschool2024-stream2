     Statistical Account

   The castles now mentioned all look to the Isle of Man,
and are probably the remains of those places of defence,
raised against the Scandinavian rovers, who used to make
that island the place of their rendezvous, and from whence
they used to annoy the Hebrides, Ireland, and Great Bri-
tain.  They not only look to the Isle of Man, but stand
upon that British ground nearest to it.
   The Roman camp mentioned above, fee p. 276, is the
only one of that description in the parish.  It is much de-
faced; yet its remains plainly prove its origin, and that it was
Castra Station.  It is upon the lands of the Honourable
Admiral R. Stewart.
   Two urns were found on Captain Hathorn's lands, in a
good state of preservation, and are now in his cabinet.
One large piece of copper, of a circular form, was also
found by one of his tenants, while dressing a field, and
brought to him.  There is in the same gentleman's cabi-
net a natural curiosity, which, though a little out of place,
I shall mention here.  It is a ball, which was taken out
of a bullock's stomach, about the size of an orange.  This
ball, being perforated, appears to be a concretion of hair
which the animal had swallowed.

   Longevity.-There have been several instances of longe-
vity here, and persons between 70 and 80 years of age
abound.  Last year (1793) a man died, who was said to
be upwards of 100; but though there are evidences to
shew that he was a very old man, there are none to fix the
year of his birth.
   Mrs Macmillan, widow of Bailie Anthony Macmillan,
late of this burgh, died this year (1794) in her hundredth
year.  She lived in this parish, and near neighbourhood
of it, all her life, and was connected with some of the best
families of the county.  Her age is well authenticated.
