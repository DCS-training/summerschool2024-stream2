inclosed.  The late Mr Scot of Dunninald, and his brother,
Mr Scot of Rossie, were the first who began to inclose their
property, in 1730.  Thorn hedges, and hedge-row trees were
first tried; but this mode being found tedious and expensive,
earthen fenses, with furze or whins on the top, were adopt-
ed.  But these, after a trial of many years, being found in-
sufficient, the gentlemen have begun to inclose with stone
dykes, or walls; and, if they persevere, with the same spirit
with which they have begun, (which there is season to believe
will be the case,) in a few years, the whole fields of the parish
will be inclosed in that manner.

   Roads.-Formerly, the king's high-way, which passes
through this parish, was very insufficient, and, in the winter,
season, almost impassable.  But, about the year 1750, by the
application of the statute labour, an excellent road betwixt
Ferryden and Arbroath, was begun, and in a few years com-
pleted.  Ths year, a new turnpike road, a little to the west
of the other, through this parish, was begun, (by a tract more
circuitous indeed, but deemed to be more level, and commo-
dious for travellers,) and will soon be finished. By means of
the statute labour, now generally commuted, we begin to en-
joy good private roads, of which we stood in great need.

   Wood.-About the beginning of this century, there was lit-
tle wood in this corner; but within these 70 or 80 years, a
good deal has been planted, and the parish may now be said to
be precty well wooded; particularly in the waste part of it,
where a great many acres have been inclosed and planted.

   Agriculture-About 60 years ago, Meffrs.  Scotts began
gradually to make considerable improvements in the cultiva-
tion of their lands.  They land plenty of lime within the pa-
