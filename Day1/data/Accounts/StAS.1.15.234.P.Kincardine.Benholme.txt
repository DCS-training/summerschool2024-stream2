present wars.  In ordinary tides the depth of the harbour is
from 10 to 12 feet, which might be farther increased at no
great expence, as the bottom is a soft marly rock.

   Probable Advantages.-Were the advantages arising from a
safe harbour at Johnshaven confined to the town or even
neighbourhood, they might be thought scarcely equivalent to
the expence necessary to procure them:  But when it is consi-
dered that a great part, one half at least of the county, would
profit greatly by this improvement, the expence must appear
inconsiderable.  If the utility of the design were attended to,
it is highly probable that the time of its execution might not
be very distant.  Many obstacles, which have hitherto pre-
vented manufactures from flourishing in this part of the
county, would then be removed; and the expence of land
carriage, which is more or less a draw back upon every branch
of trade, would be greatly diminished.  To vessels employed
in the coasting trade it would prove of the utmost conse-
quence, as they might find an easy and safe retreat here from
the storm, in certain winds, when it would be destruction
for them to attempt landing on any other part of the coast,
betwixt the Frith of Forth anti the Murray Frith.

   Trade and Commerce.-The trade here chiefly consists in
importing coals and exporting grain.  A sufficient quantity
of the former article is brought in summer from Sunderland,
and the Frith of Forth, to supply the town and neighbour-
hood through the year.  Some cargoes of lime are also
brought from the same places, for the use of the farmer.  Till
of late, Montrose was the only market for grain in this neigh-
bourhood, when two merchants in Johnshaven were tempt-
ed, by the situation of the place, to commence dealers in
