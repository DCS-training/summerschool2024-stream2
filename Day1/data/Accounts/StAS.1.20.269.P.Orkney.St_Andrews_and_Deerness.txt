three years, and many from year to year; the want of a
ready market for their grain; the poverty of the people,
most of whom, on taking a farm, are not able to stock it
without borrowing money; their keeping more cattle on
their farms than they can well maintain; and, beyond all,
the shortness and uncertainty of the seasons, and the want
of inclosures and winter herding, owing to which, all the 
cattle, horses, sheep, swine, geese &c. go at large for about
nine months in the year.  As soon as any one tenant cuts
and brings in his corn, the whole country becomes at once
a common, and all his neighbours must follow his example,
or leave their crops, ripe and unripe, to be trodden down
and destroyed.  In the parish of Deerness, many of the te-
nants go to sea, and neglect their farms entirely.

   Proprietors and People.-There are five gentlemen pro-
prietors in St Andrews, and five in Deerness, none of whom
reside in the parish, which is manifestly against the im-
provement of the land, and general advantage and comfort
of the people.  Besides these, there are six udelars in Deer-
ness, persons whose property, in some parts of Orkney, is
so small, as, if let to a tenant, would scarcely draw above a
tub of bear, that is, about a firlot, of yearly rent.  The in-
habitants of both parishes, who are in general treated with
great humanity by their landlords, are sober, regular, indu-
strious, and being remarkably averse to drinking spiritous
liquors, they are healthy, and live to the ordinary age of
man.  There are no instances of extraordinary longevity in
either of the parishes.
