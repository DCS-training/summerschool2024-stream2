     Name, Situation, and Boundaries.

   THE name is derived from the Gaelic, and is expressive
of its natural situation, Lug signifying a hollow or low
place.  Though this parish is one of the highest in Scotland
with regard to its elevation above the sea, there are in it ma-

of Glenelg, extending, from north-east to south-west, up-
wards of 20 miles.  The breadth of the inhabited part is a-
bout 3 miles; but, taking its boundaries south and north, it
will measure more than 20 miles.  It is bounded on the
north by Monu-liec, or Grey Mountain, a prodigious ridge of 
inaccessible rocks.

the mountains.  It runs through the middle of the parish;
its course is from west ot east, inclining a little to the north.
In its progress, besides many rivulets, it receives the river
