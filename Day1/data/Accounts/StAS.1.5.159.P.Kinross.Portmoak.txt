     of Portmoak.

ground through which it passes is rich meadow, but so le-
vel, and the windings of the river so many, that great part
of it is laid under water during the winter.  It abounds
with very large trouts, which are sometimes found also in
the lake; but those of them that are caught in the river
larger; many weighing 5 pounds, and some of them much
more.  It abounds also with pike.  But the most remark-
able fishing in this river is that of eels.  In the month of
September they begin to go down from the loch in great
numbers to the sea, but only during the night.  When this
season arrives, the fishes place their nets in the river, which
they draw every two hours during the night, and frequent-
ly find them full.  As the bulk of the people have an a-
version to them as food, from their serpentine appearance,
this fishing turns to little account in the view of profit.

   Climate, Diseases.-Perhaps it cannot be said, that there
is any thing peculiar to the climate of this parish.  It is,
in some degree, sheltered from the cold easterly winds,
which in the spring, are severely felt upon the south and
east coasts of Fife.  But it lies exposed to the north-west
wind, which, blowing across the Ochil hills covered with
snow, and along the surface of the lake, becomes intensely
cold.  On the whole, however, it may be safely asserted,
that the air is salubrious, the people vigorous, and subject
to few distempers.  Inoculation for the small-pox being un-
known here, that distemper is fatal to children.  To inocu-
late is here regarded as criminal.  It is hoped, however, 
that these prejudices will soon disappear, and suffer a prac-
tice to be introduced, which has been attended with the
happiest effects in other places.  There are at this time 50
people living in the parish, upwards of 70 years of age.  Of
these, 19 are 75; 9 are 80; 2, 90; and 1, 97.  The father of
this last one died at the advanced age of 106.
