   Exports.-This parish exports annually two thirds of its
corn, besides cattle, a few sheep and swine, (but no horses),
a considerable quantity of salmon, linen cloth, and free-stone,

an evident proof of the excellence of that constitution of
government, under which we have the good fortune to live.

   Church and School.-The church is a very handsome modern
building, and is much decorated by an ancient family seat of
very curious workmanship belonging to the Earl of Mans-
field.  It was built in the year 1784; the manse in the year
1743; and the latter has been frequently repaired.  The
living, including the glebe, is about L. 100 Sterling.  The
Right Hon. the Earl of Mansfield is patron.  The present
incumbent, the Rev. Mr John Wright, is married, and has
five children*.  Besides, the parish church, there is also a
