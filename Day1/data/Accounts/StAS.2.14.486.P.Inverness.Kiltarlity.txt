itself of a most grand and imposing nature. Some of the firs
here measure from 14 to 16 feet in circumference, and are up-
wards of 60 feet in height. About 400 yards from Guisachan
House, which is a large and elegant mansion, surrounded by
verdant lawns, there is a beautiful fall of water, well worthy of
note. The stream is precipitated over a ]edge of rock about 70
feet high into a circular basin of considerable dimensions, form-
ing a deep dark linn, which, together with the very romantic
ravine through which the water escapes, is overhung by many
species of wood, exhibiting the most luxuriant foliage, and in
some cases very fantastic vegetation-the productions of an un-
commonly fertile soil, watered by the spray which is continually
falling around them. Indeed, none but those who have visited this
romantic spot can form any idea of the varied scenery presented to
their observation. The soil is as rich as any in the Lothians, and
there is about the place altogether a pleasant air of comfort and
neatness, which is greatly enhanced by the striking contrast it pre-
sents to the steep mountains and rugged wilds with which it is
environed. The venerable and worthy proprietor of this estate
has evinced great taste in improving its natural beauties, and has
taken advantage of the capabilities of the soil by introducing the
most approved system of modern agriculture to a district, which,
though now nearly able to maintain itself without having recourse
to the importation of corn from other parts of the country, was,
until within a few years ago, inhabited by a wild, irregular, po-
verty-stricken people, among whom the demoralising practice of
illicit distillation prevailed to a very great extent, favoured and
encouraged as it was, by the inaccessible nature of the sur-
rounding country. Happily, however, these days are now gone
by, and, owing to the judicious measures adopted by the pro-
prietors for the encouragement of industry and the promotion
of education, a great and beneficial change has been effect-
ed, not only on the appearance of the country, but on the ha-
bits and dispositions of the peasantry of Strathglass, who now,
though perhaps, indeed, more excitable in temperament and less
regularly industrious than their neighbours in the lower part of
the parish, are, upon the whole, happy and contented with their
lot in life ; and, in their bearing towards strangers, as well as in
their intercourse with one another,evince a high degree of native
politeness and hospitality,-wbile, at the same time, their almost
uniformly respectful demeanour towards superiors is a pleasant
trait in their character, which recommends them to the notice,
