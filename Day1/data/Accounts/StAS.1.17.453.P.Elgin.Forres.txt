   Navigation, etc.-The river Findhorn is navigate for
boats no farther than the tide flows.  B did the
of commerce and manufactures require it, there is no place
where a canal might be more easily made.  From Forres to
the mouth of the Bay of Findhorn which is the sea port of
Forres, the distance does not exceed 3 miles, and the tide
slows in the bason more than half that distance; and the le-
vel of the ground, at the foot of the eminence on which the
town of Forres stands, does not exceed the level of half tide
by 14 feet; and that depth of a canal would carry boats
and lighters at high water to the town; and such a canal.
would have the advantage of the burn of Forres to keep it
clear.  The bason already mentioned is a triangular piece of
low ground, partly of that kind of still clay soil called carse
ground; and partly of fine compact sand, mixed with light
particles of earth washed down by the floods.  It is all dry
at low water, except the channel of the river, and a little
space at the inlet at high-water.  Its circumference will be
at lear 7 miles, and contains more than 2 square miles of
ground, all of which might be recovered from the sea, ex-
cept what is necessary for a channel to the fresh water streams.
A bar of sand, which stretches across the mouth of the ri-
ver, prevents any surge from entering the bason; so that an
embankment would have no weight of water to sustain, but
the small fetch of the lake itself.

   Limestone, etc.-In all this parish there is only one quarry
of limestone, upon the estate of Mr Cuming of Altyre.  It
is not used in any great quantities.  There is only one small
patch of coarse moor-stone; and no detached stones are
