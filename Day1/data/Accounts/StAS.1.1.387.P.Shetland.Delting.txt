made during the fit.  One observation occurs on this disor-

and during the two last years of plenty it has appeared more 
frequently.

   Lakes, Coasts, Islands, Fisheries.-There are in the parish some
small lakes or lochs, and some small rivulets, but no stream
that deserves the name of a river.  In these lakes and rivu-
lets, the only fish is a small kind of trout; but, about the be-
ginning of August, sea trouts, of a very large size, are caught
in nets made for the purpose in the mouth of the different
rivulets.  No fish of this kind are ever sold, but given in pre-
sents through the neighbourhood.  The inhabitants fit out
boats for the ling, cod, and tusk fishing, on the coasts of the 
neighbouring parish of Northmaving.  The season of this
fishery is during the months of June and July, and a part of
August.  How far the people, in general, are benefited by 
this fishing, will appear from the following statement.
