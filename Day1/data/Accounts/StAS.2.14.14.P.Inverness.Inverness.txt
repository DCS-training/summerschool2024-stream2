rious mount, is a high gravelly ridge called Tor-a'-Bhean, from its
containing the cairn or sepulchre, according to some, of an early
monk called Bean or Benjamin, but more likely of Donald Bane,
an Hebridean chief, and leader of a body of islesmen, who, in II87,
encountered a party from the Castle of Inverness, headed by Duncan
Mackintosh, son of the governor, who, as well as his principal
opponent,is said to have perished in the conflict. Part of this
ridge is encircled with ditches and ramparts, as if it formed an
ancient hill-fort, and at its base, along which the Caledonian Canal
has been carried, a massive silver chain was discovered in the year
1808, consisting of thirty-three circular double links, neatly channelled
round with a prominent astragal, and terminating at either
end in two rings larger than the others, which were about two inches
in diameter, the whole weighing 104 ounces, and extending
to eighteen inches in length.  This relic, now, we believe, in the
possession of the Antiquarian Society in Edinburgh, was probably
an ornament or ensign of office of the island chieftain. The
estate of Bught, of which Tor-a'-Bhean is a part, is called in Gaelic
Kil a Bhean or Bean's burying-ground. 5th, On' the margin of
Loch Dochfour, four miles further on, are seen the ruins of the old
church of the parish of Bona, now united to that of Inverness, and
on an adjoining peninsula between this lake and Loch-Ness there is
an oblong square, rounded at the corners, and encircled with an irregular
ditch, which is believed to have been a Roman encampment,
pitched, according to Mr Chalmers, (Caledonia, 1. 63,) on
the site of the British Boness, or foot of Loch-Ness, a name Latinized
by the Romans into Bonessia, and by Ptolemy into Banatia.
On the eastern Ager are the remains of a small baronial keep, styled
" Castle Spiritin" which completely commanded the adjoining fords
across the River Ness, and to which, most probably, belonged the
walled structure or look-out-place, on the summit of the adjoining
granitic ridge of the Craigderg or the red rocks.  6th, At the commencement
of the ascent from Loch-Ness to the upland district of
Aberiachan, still further westward, are the remains of an ancient
kil, or burying-ground, on which probably the church of Bona originally
stood; and on the moss of Caiplich, which occupies a flat
or piece of table-land, nearly ten miles long, at the top of the district
just mentioned, are many sepulchral cairns, marking the sites
of early clan conflicts.  7th, Returning to the eastern boundary of
the parish, the most important locality is the well known and of
described field of the battle of Culloden, and one mile beyond it,
