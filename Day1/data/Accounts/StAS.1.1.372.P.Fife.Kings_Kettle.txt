to his own hand, and has improved them; subdivided them
mostly with ditch and hedge, and belts of planting; adorned
them with clumps of trees, and elegant farm houses of two
stories and garrets, covered with blue slate, and rigged with
lead; all which give more vivacity and beauty to this part of
the country than it had before, and will, when the planting
is grown up, enliven it much more.

   Minerals.-In the farm of Barntark there is a quarry of
free-stone.  It is covered by a stratum of earth 4 feet thick.
When this is removed, we observe upon the surface of the
rock numerous impressions of vegetable bodies, apparently
formed by branches of trees, of various diameters, curiously

which were completely filled with transparent concretions.
The mass is situated at the lower extremity of a lime-stone
rock.  The forms of the shells are most distinct on the sur-
face.  There are not nay petrifying springs in the parish;
but, in some places, stalactites are formed by the cozings of
coal water.  There is no marble of slate here; but an almost
inexhaustible abundance of moor-stone and free-stone, which
are of an excellent quality, and much employed in dyking and
building.  Lime-stone of the best kind is also abundant:  One
quarry at Forthar, belonging to Dr Pitcairn, physician in Lon-
