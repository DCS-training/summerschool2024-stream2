   Roads.-The roads in this parish are uncommonly good,
which could not fail to be the case, as the two principal
openings to the western parts of Scotland are through it,
and there are abundance of materials in every quarter for
repairing them.  The upper road, passing through Currie,
forms the communication with Lanark and the county of
Ayr; which, since the erection of the cotton works, has be-
come a considerable thoroughfare, two stages passing regu-
larly that way twice a-week.  The lower road, is the com-

   Manufactures.-With respect to the manufactures of the
parish, little can be said.  The only one, that of pa-

ment.  The paper trade employs children from 10 or 12
years of age, a period when they can do nothing very la-
borious, and when their morals, from idleness and neglect,
are very apt to be corrupted.  It employs also, in some
departments, people who are a good deal advanced in life,
and after they can no longer work at those occupations
without doors, that require much exertion.  The annual
wages, earned in the work of Messrs Nisbet and Macni-
ven, may amount to from L. 1000 to L. 1200 Sterling,
which is mostly spent in the parish, and chiefly in purcha-
sing the very necessaries of life.-There are also several
corn mills in this and the adjoining parish, whose chief em-
