     of Kirkpatrick-Fleeming.

     I wish I were where I have been,
     Embracing of my love Helen,
     At Venus's games we'v'e been right keen,
     On fair Kirkconnell lee.

     
     I wish my grave were growing green,
     A winding sheet put o'er my een,
     And I in Helen's arm lying,
     on fair Kirkconnell lee.

     
     I wish I were where Helen lies,
     Where night and day she on me cries;
     I wish I were where Helen lies,
     On fair Kirkconnell lee.
