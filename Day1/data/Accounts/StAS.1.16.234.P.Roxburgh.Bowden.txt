to raise excellent crops of corn and grass.  Lime produces
better grain, but marl answers best for grass, especially for
pasture.  After trying many varieties of every grain, the
most approved are now white oats, barley bear, (so
called to distinguish it from rough bear, or big); early
pease, here called hot seed; and Kentish, or Cleaveland
wheat.  Very little rye is sown, and no flax but for family
use.  On about 1650 acres, about 1100 bolls of diffe-
rent grains are annually sown; nearly as follows, viz. 120
of wheat, 100 of pease, 750 of oats, and 130 of barley;
which last is followed by a hay crop.  There are besides
140 acres, yearly, in turnip; 50 in potatoes; and 160 in fal-
low.  Turnips are generally succeeded by barley; potatoes
sometimes by barley, but more commonly by oats; fallow
partly by wheat and partly by oats; and lands, ploughed out
of lee or pasture, are always sown with oats.  After maintain-
ing the inhabitants, the annual exports may be about 350
bolls of oat-meal, at L. 1, 5 s. per boll; 300 ditto of barley,
at 18 s.; and 450 ditto of wheat, at L. 1, 2 s. amounting in
all to L. 1202, 10 s. per annum.

   Horses Black Cattle, Sheep, and Wool.-There are 160
horses of different ages in the parish, one-fourth of which are
too young for labour.  The black cattle of all ages may be
54o.  About 90 are reared yearly, and about 50 are shall-
fed for the butcher, which weigh at an average from 45 to
50 stone of 16 lb.  Dutch weight*.  The cows of the same
breed, when fattened, weigh about 36 stone.  About 80
swine are annually fed, mostly by tradesmen.  They
are bought in England in October or November, when
3 or 4 months old at 10 s. or 12 s. each; and after feeding

*The Dutch weight is always meant, when meal, grain, or butcher
meat are smoken of.  The Sctoch weight of 24 English lb. to the stone,
is used for selling wool, cheete, butter, and hay
