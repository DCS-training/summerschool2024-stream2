the bottom to the width of forty-nine feet. The Garvald Linns
is the other. These are seen by every person going to Garvald.
On first leaving the public road that conducts to the head of the
parish, the channel of the Garvald water is rocky, and its banks
steep; but as these become less so, the attention is gradually with-
drawn to other objects. It is when the mind is in this state that the
Garvald Linns first present themselves. The effect is what might
be expected. One is struck with the grandeur of the scene ; vast
rocks, rugged precipices, steep banks, covered here and there with
mountain-ashes and wild honeysuckle,--and the river now disappear-
ing among the huge masses, and again, as if glad to be disentangled,
hurrying on in its course. These form a group which please and
astonish the beholder. But to see the Garvald Linns in perfec-
tion, you must leave the road to Garvald, and go to the head of
the bank, where the scenery is bolder. New rocks are seen, and
a beautiful cascade of about eight feet appears.
	Meteorology.--Since writing my account of the parish to Sir
John Sinclair in 1793, I have had time to make many observations
on the weather and state of the atmosphere. The following table is
formed from a series of observations made for eleven years, at Esk-
dalemuir manse, every moriiidg at nine o'clock, with a well regu-
lated Fahrenheit's thermometer at a northern exposure. I consider
them valuable from their proximity to the chain of mountains above-
mentioned; and because none have been made (that I know of)
nearer than Branxholm on the one hand, and Broomholm on the
other.
