strata in which they occur. Thus the organic remains of Balrud-
dery are found in the slate clay of the gray sandstone, whilst those
of the red sandstone of Clashbinnie quarry are imbedded in sili-
ceous matter. Mr Miller subdivides the old red sandstone de-
posits into three, distinct classes, and apparently from the circum-
stance of the red and gray sandstones of this district having an or-
ganism of one particular species, viz. the Cephelaspis common to
both, he classes them as belonging to the second or intermediate
division; but it is scarcely enough to say, that because particular
fossil organic remains have not been found to occur throughout
the various beds of a great deposit, such as the old red sandstone
series, therefore they do not belong simply to one general deposit,
or that a special and invariable subdivision may be inferred from
it, or that any distinct ground of comparison of them will thereby
arise with similar deposits of a different locality or country. This
is a well known circumstance with regard to other deposits, though
perhaps on a smaller scale, as in thd lountain limestone, or in the
coal formation generally, where particular fossils are found to oc-
cur in some deposits, whilst they are totally awanting, or of partial
occurrence merely in others, and reappear again without any as-
signable order whatever, so that whilst sufficient ground may be
afforded for the comparison of the formation or deposit generally,
with those of a similar character which occur at different and dis-
tant localities, still they can by no means be held sufficient for as-
signing any rule or order of occurrence. The mineral character
and contents of the deposit also give rise to very considerable and
important effects, as from the effect pointed out by Lyell, by the
presence of oxide of iron in greater or less quantity, which must
in many instances account for the absence of organic remains,
which might otherwise have occurred in them. The beautiful
state of preservation in which the organic remains of Balruddery,
although mostly of a very delicate texture, occur, in consequence
of the total absence, or nearly so, of iron in the slate clay in which
they are found, is a remarkable instance. And it is an undoubt-
ed fact that there is a great irregularity in the character and oc-
currence of the old red sandstones of Scotland and elsewhere.
	There appear, indeed, to be many satisfactory grounds for formhnf
a conclusion regarding the strata of this distrirt, both from their
relative position and internal structure, although, of course care
must always be taken not to place too much reliance on this latter
ground, which is too often the cause of error in the geological ob-
