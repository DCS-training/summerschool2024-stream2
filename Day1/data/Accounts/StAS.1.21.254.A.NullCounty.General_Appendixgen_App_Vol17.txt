with applause, for bringing the other magistrates to account
for intromission with the Good Town's revenue.
   This gentleman was, by the States of Scotland, in the Con-
vention 1688, appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the Edin-
burgh Regiment, raised at the Revolution 1688, as appears
from the 3d volume of the Scots Acts, page 139, and the
records of the town-council of Edinburgh.
   He afterwards purchased Olivestob from his eldest brother,
William Hamilton, who left no issue.  His eldest son, James,
went early into the army; and was wounded at the siege of
Namur, carried on successfully by King William in person,
anno 1695.  Mr James Hamilton, after the peace in 1697,
studied the civil law, etc. at Leyden; and was admitted
advocate in 1703; and was sheriff of Haddington, by com-
mission from Queen Anne, till 1715.  He was brother-in-
law to Lord Grange.  He sold his estate of Olivestob to Col.
Gardiner, who was killed very near the manour house by
the rebels, 21st Sept. 1745.  It was afterwards purchased by
Mr Andrew M'Doual, advocate, who about ten years after
was promoted to the bench, most deservedly, and, out of de-
licacy to his old friend Mr Hamilton, took the title of Lord
Bankton, instead of Olivestob.  Mr Hamilton died in an ad-
vanced age in 1757.  His son, Major Thomas Hamilton of
Olivestob, was wrecked, with the late Lord Byron and Cap-
tain Cheape, in the course of Lord Anson's celebrated voyage,
in I742.  They returned to London together in 1746, after
suffering incredible hardships, and had been given up by their
relations for lost.  The sister of Colonel Thomas Hamilton
was mother to the celebrated William Hamilton of Bangour,
whose poetic taste and virtues are known everywhere.  She
was also the last wife and widow of the eminent Sir Hew Dal-
rymple of North-Berwick, Lord President of the Court of
Session.
