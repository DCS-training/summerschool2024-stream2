     Statistical Account

   Population, etc.-By the return to Dr Webster in 1755,
the numbers were 1691.  By the last accurate survey of the
parish, the numbers were 1620.  The decrease, which is 71,
is to be accounted for in the following manner.  There are 6
different farms in the parish, occupied by one tenant; for-
merly possessed by 3.  There is indeed one farm divided into
3, but there are 3 other farms possessed by one tenant, which
were formerly occupied by 2. Every plough in the parish
some years ago, had a man to hold, and a youth to drive it;
the labour of the farms was chiefly carried on by married ser-
vants whose families resided on them.  It is more the custom
now to perform the labour by unmarried servants who have a
house near the tenants, in which they sleep, and prepare their
food.  After they retire from work, they are free from the
respect due to the eye of their master, and if inclined to wan-
der, are at full liberty.  I believe that these circumstances
are not favourable to morals, and that the union of small into
large farms, is unfriendly to population.

   Abstract of Baptisms and Marriages from 1750, to 1759
inclusive, (there being no record of burials kept at that pe-
riod;) and from 1780, to 1789 inclusive, to which the list of
funerals within that period is added.  No calculation can
however be made of the number of deaths from the funerals;
as many from neighbouring parishes are buried here, and
many of the people of this parish in the neighbouring church-
yards.
