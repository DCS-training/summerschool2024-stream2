led fail; of roofing houses, when the sward is pared thin,
and for fuel, which they call troves.  The hill grounds have
been likewise much much injured by burning the heath in
improper seasons and places; and no pains are taken, even
where the situation will admit of it, to extirpate heath by wa-
tering.  A considerable part of the pasture lands in this pa-
rish, might be made good arable soil, by draining, and the o-
ther means of improvement.  The hill grounds might, by
good management, be greatly bettered; and there are several
tracts of ground which fall under the division of pasture lands
in this district, that are only fit for plantstations.
   In this county, and indeed pretty generally over this coun-
try, farmers almost never change their seed, using always the
produce of their own farms; but they are at some pains to
have it as good and found as the best of their corn with re-
peated winnowings will give.  The best oats in this country
are of an excellent quality; for in tolerable seasons, the boll+
will yield 8 or 9 stones, and even more of meal, which is
ground much smaller and better sifted than in the South of
Scotland.  The gray oats, or barley corn, neither give so much
in quantity, nor of such quality; and they are sometimes so
bad, as to require two bolls to produce eight stones of meal.
In spring 1783, when there was great reason to apprehend
that the crop of 1782 was too scanty and faulty to afford a
sufficiency of good seed, a cargo of fine Dutch oats was sent
to this country by the late Mr Farquharson of Haughton, for
his own tenants and the neighbours, and they contributed to
secure the next crop.  There oats were, however, said to de-
generate by bad cultivation, and they were liable to shake be-
fore they were perfectly ripe; and for these reasons they are
not now sown.  The Montgomery or Magbiehill oats have
