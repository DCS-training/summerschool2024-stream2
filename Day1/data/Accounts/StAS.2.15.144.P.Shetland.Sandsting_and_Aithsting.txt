This operation of casting the heart in performed to this day in some parts of the
Zetland isles, and implicit belief placed in its efficacy.  The patient must wear the
lead, which has been used, in his bosom, for some time after the operation."__Miss
Campbell's Harley Raddington.
   Even so late as the beginning of the last century, visitors were frightened to ap-
proach the shores of Shetland, for fear of being brought under the influence of the
spells of witches and warlocks : And by the old country acts, the ranselmen were en -
joined to seek out and bring to condign punishment, all persons who made use of
any manner of witchcraft, charms, or any other abominable or devilish superstitions.
The sign by which persons might be discovered were, their being devilish, fearful
and abominable cursers; takers away of their neighbour's profits ; charmers and
healers of some, and casters of sickness upon others; and who led damnable and
abominable lives, contrary to God's commandments.  As long as the islands were
subjected to the Pope, in matters of faith, crosses, and benedictions, and amulets and
prayers and pilgrimages were sufficient to prevent or to cure all the effects of the black
arts,  And even after the Reformation had been introduced, it was found no easy
matter to shake the general belief in the efficacy of many of the Popish ceremonies ;
and, hence, many were ready to supply the place of the Catholic priests,-to pretend
to cure diseases,-to " tell away pains,"_--to counteract the effets of an evil eye or
an evil tongue,--and to promise all manner of success in worldly affairs.
