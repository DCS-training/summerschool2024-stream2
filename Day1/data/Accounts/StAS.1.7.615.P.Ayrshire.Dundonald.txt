     of Dundonald.

     NUMBER LV.

     PARISH OF DUNDONALD.

     (County and Presbytery of Ayr.-Synod of Glasgow and
     Ayr.)

     By the Reverend Mr ROBERT DUNCAN.

     Name and Situation.

   NO word in the English language accurately determines
the form of that rising ground which is known in
Scotland by the Celtic term, dun.  The parish of Dundon-
ald derives its name from an eminence on which stands an
antient and royal castle.  In this castle lived and died Robert
II. the first King of the Stewart line.  From Irvine harbour,
which is within its limit, this parish extends eight English
miles along the sea cost, and terminates on the south, at the
place where the Rumbling and Pow-burns meet, and dis-
charge themselves into the sea: A place which, on account
of its quick sands, is very dangerous to travellers*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The sea coast between Ayr and Irvine being flat, and, ex-
cepting at this place, which is about three miles from Ayr, the
sands being firm and the prospect delightful, a strong tempta-
tion is presented to pass from the one town to the other along
shore.  But, as some persons have been burried alive at this spot,
it is an important caution not to attempt passing it at high wa-
ter, and at other times to keep as close as possible to the low
water mark.
