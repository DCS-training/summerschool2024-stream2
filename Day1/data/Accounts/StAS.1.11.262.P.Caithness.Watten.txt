during the scarcest season, to the most indigent.  By the com-
mendable liberality- of one heritor, who lately purchased the
largest estate in the parish, the more necessitous have had their
yearly allowance increased.  This is not mentioned with a
view to flatter, but as an example worthy the imitation of
non-residing heritors in general.  It is a duty incumbent up-
on them to remember the poor, within the bounds of their re-

   Church and School.-From 1744 to 1792, the living was
700 merks, 20 bolls oatmeal, and 12 bolls bear, with 40 L.
Scotch, in name of communion element money; besides a glebe,
consisting of about 12 acres, part of which is of a very indif-

to be rebuilt the ensuing season.  The schoolmaster's salary
was modified in the year 1760, by the Commissioners of Sup-

leaving it optional to the several heritors to pay their pro-
portion of the victual, either in kind or in money, at the rate
of 5 L. Scotch per boll.  All of them chose to pay their re-
spective proportions in money, to the no small prejudice of
the teacher.  It is much to be regretted, that in this our Ci-
vilized country, such an useful body of men should be so much
neglected.  The education of youth is an object highly de-
