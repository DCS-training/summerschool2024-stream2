well clad, and more experienced mariners.  Were the en-
couragements to fishing greater, which might be effected
by the removal of those difficulties and obstacles, which at
present stand in the way of that useful and beneficial branch
of business, in consequence of the rigour of the salt laws,
much good and great profit would thereby accrue not
only to this parish, but to the whole country around*;
nor need it be observed, that were a village founded at
Portree, it would be attended with many important bene-
fits; the foregoing indulgence would establish it at once, if
a plenary indulgence could not be granted.

*It would insure to the inhabitants a certain provision to their fami-
lies for the year, and prevent a vast consumption of meal imported into
the country, if a report was annually given in of the number of the small
class of tenants, to whom 2 barrels of salt might be distributed upon oath,
for the purpose of curing the relative quantity of heirings to be eat with
their potatoes; even one barrel would totally change the face of affairs,
where subsistence is so scanty, and population so overbearing.  This tri-
fling indulgence would contribute to the necessities of many thousands.
A sworn rental, containing each name, might be annually produced at a
proper season; it would be impossible that salt distributed in such small
proportions within the respective districts, could ever be misused, or em-
ployed so beneficially to the possessor as in securing his subsistence; an
experiment might be made for one or more years, and prosecuted or con-
demned according to the salt officer's report.
