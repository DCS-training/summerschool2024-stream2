   I wish you could get some schools established at Derryna-
fuaran.  One for literature, and another for the other useful
purposes just now mentioned, would much improve the poor
people here.  It is a hard case if the Society at Edinburgh
refuse to concur with you in so laudable an undertaking.
   If the Pollew road was made the establishment of a packet
boat betwixt Torridon and the isle of Sky, it would be of
much benefit to this coast and the Western Isles.  The road
betwixt Torridon and Kinlochew should also be repaired, if
not wholly new-modelled.  Even as it stands, it must be
owned to be of great service, not only to your own tenants,
but also to their neighbours.  It seems to be one of the best
improvements ever attempted in this country.
   By promoting the improvements suggested above, the
state would be strengthened, the landholders would be be-
nefited, and the situation of the Highlanders themselves ren-
dered much more comfortable.
