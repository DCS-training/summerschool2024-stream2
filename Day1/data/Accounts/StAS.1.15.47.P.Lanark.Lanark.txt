     of Lanark.

   Lanark, however, has two obstacles to manufactures.
The first, the poverty and uncultivated state of the country
around, and indeed of the whole upper ward of Lanarkshire,
from which circumstance meal, and almost every other arti-
cle, is dearer than at Edinburgh or Glasgow, coals and po-
tatoes excepted.  But were the country in an improved state,
and did proprietors and husbandmen do their utmost to im-
prove the soil, this drawback, in the course of a few years,
might be got the better of.  The next obstacle is the great
distance, that raw materials are to be carried; and the badness
of the roads.  Lanark is 24 miles from Glasgow, and 30
from Edinburgh: the road to Edinburgh is an exceeding good
one, but that to Glasgow, which is the principal market, is
exceedingly bad; besides, it encounters with a very deep
ravine, formed by the Mouss within a mile of Lanark.  This
disadvantage is in some measure doing away, by a new road
now forming by Lanark bridge; over which it crosses to Les-
mahago parish, and from thence runs along the immediate
banks of the Clyde by Hamilton to Glasgow.  The pulls
here are considerably less than in the former road, and, when
finished, which will be in spring 1794, it will form one of
the most beautiful and romantic roads in Scotland.  This,
however, is a partial remedy, nor can any thing effectual
be done to overcome the disadvantage, unless the southern
tract of the canal between Edinburgh and Glasgow were to
be adopted.
   The want of a flour mill not only obstructs improvements
in agriculture, but puts the inhabitants under the necessity
of using oat and barley bread, or of buying wheaten bread
at a great price; all which could be easily remedied.  The
community of Lanark has a corn mill upon Mouss water,
which, at a very little expence, might be enabled to grind
both wheat and oats.  Encouragement would there be given
