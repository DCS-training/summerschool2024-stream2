few sheep in it.  The common kind are sold at 10 s. each;
those of the English breed are reckoned worth double that
sum.  The next principal commodities, which the farmers
dispose of, are meal and grain.  A small proportion only is sold
in the country, as most of the inhabitants have crofts of their
own.  Meal is exported to Norway,  or sold in the western
isles; grain is commonly disposed of in the Frith of Forth.
Barley weights from 16 to 20 stone the boll, of 16 pecks; the
price is from 8 d. to 10 d. the stone.  Beans are sold at 12 s.
6 d. the boll of 3 sirlots, oats at from 10 s. to 12 s. the boll of
4 sirlots; and oat meal at from 10 s. to 13 s. the boll of 8
stone.  Butter and cheese are also articles for which the
farmers draw a considerable sum yearly.  Some advantage
is likewise derived from the labour of women servants with-

have large families, or are visited with sickness.  The daily
wages of a mason are 1 s. 4 d. ; of a joiner 1 s.; but other me-

The wages of a man servant are L. 5 Sterling yearly, and of
a woman, L. 2, 10 s. besides victuals.

   Fuel.-One of the most expensive articles in this place is
fuel, the moss, where peats are got, being five miles distant.
Peats are estimated by the leet, which is a solid body, piled
up like bricks, 24 feet long, and 12 feet broad at bottom, and
