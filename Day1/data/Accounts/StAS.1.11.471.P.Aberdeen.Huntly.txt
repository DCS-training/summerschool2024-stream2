the other side lead, the one to Portsoy, 10 computed miles

Castle, and the river Spey.

   Fish.-Both the Doveron and the Bogie afford excellent
trouts.  Those of the Bogie are preferable to the others, from
its muddy and clayey bottom, and perhaps from the soft qua-
lity of its water.  After a flood, many salmon are got; and did
the proprietors of the salmon-fishing, at Banff, observe the le-
gal openings in their cruives or dikes, many more might be
caught, to the great advantage of the different heritors.

   Minerals.-Upon the banks of the Doveron, near its junc-
tion with the Bogie, there was an attempt made, some years
ago, to discover a lead mine, and, after digging to a consider-
able depth, many pieces of a black friable matter, like the
ore which the lead pencils are made of, were got; but the
work was discontinued.-A lime-stone quarry was happily
discovered, some years ago, in the S. W. end of the parish,
but when opened, it was found so difficult to get at, that it was
abandoned, after working to a considerable depth.-Near the
same place there is a kind of white marble, of which the
author has been a horizontal dial made, perfectly smooth on
the surface, and all the lines and figures drawn quite clear as
on slate.

   Agriculture.-In this parish there are many excellent farms,
ented from 20 l. to 60 l., including a certain proportion of
farm meal, of the best quality, which the tenants are obliged
