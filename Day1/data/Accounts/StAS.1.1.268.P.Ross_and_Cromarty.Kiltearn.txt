merce were little attented to, men of an enterprising spirit
had no other field for distinguishing themselves but by their
superior skill in the use of arms.  This induced them to watch
for every opportunity of displaying their martial atchieve-

the old feuds, they found it no easy matter to restrain the
lower ranks among their followers from assassinating their

between the families of Seaforth and Fowlis.  An old record,
which gives a character od Sir John Munro of Fowlis, speaks
thus:  'He lived in good correspondence with his neigh-
