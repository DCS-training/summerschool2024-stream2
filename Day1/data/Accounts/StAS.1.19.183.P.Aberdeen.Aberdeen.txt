far the greatest number of names of places are from the old.
Scotch dialect, which has been now for many ages the lan-
guage of the country.  Not any more remarkable instan-
ces of such derivation in this perish can be given, than the
names of the streets of the town, the principal of which are
the Castlegate, the Braidgate, the Overkirkgate, the Ne-
therkirkgate, the Gallowgate.  Add to these, the Gaist-
raw, the Shipraw, the Rottenraw, the Dubbyraw, the
Checkeraw, the Narrow-wynd, the Back-wynd, the Cor-
rection-wynd.  These, with Putachie's-side, and the Green,
are almost all the old names of streets and lanes in the
town.  We cannot give a better example than in this very
thing of the advances noticed in a former article, which we
are daily making towards English.  We almost never hear
now of the Braidgate and the Castlegate.  They are become
universally the Broadstreet and the Castlestreet.  The Gal-
lowgate, for what good reason we know not, has not yet
shared in this reformation, for nobody ventures upon Gal-
lowstreet.  The Kirkgates too remain the same as ever.
They are never called Churchstreets, though we more com-
monly say the Upper than the Over Kirkgate.  There is
little or no change made on the other passages called wynds
and raws.  Only it is to be observed, that in all those
which have been made in the city or suburbs for at least
fifty years past, we have neither gates nor wynds; they are
all streets and lanes.  Thus we have within that period
got Queen-Street, Marshal-Street, North-Street, Shoe-lane,
Justice-lane, etc. etc.  If the same humour prevails in
other places of the country, we may conclude, that
the word, gate and wynd, occurring in any compound
names of the passages through a city or town in Scotland,
will serve as evidences of an antiquity higher at least than
the middle of the 18th century.  As to the names of the
few hills, gentlemen's seats, etc. lying near the town, they
