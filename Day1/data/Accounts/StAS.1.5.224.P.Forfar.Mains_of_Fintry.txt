   They cost at the shore 6 1/2 d. per cwt.  Here they are free
of duty, but this is a burden severely felt by many other
parts of the country.  It is much against the increase and
prosperity of manufactures, and should be removed by the
Legislature.

   Advantages, etc.-This parish being sitauted near Dundee,
finds a ready market for every article the inhabitants have
to fell; who can, with equal ease, procure any thing they
want from that town.  The farmers have plenty of ma-
nare from it, and being so near the shore, the lime is pret-
ty reasonable which, with dung, answers all the purposes
of manure.  This parish also possesses advantages over se-
veral places of the country in point of climate.  None
of it lying very high, (being mostly dry and sheltered with
hedges) they have their harvest more early, and do not run
such a risk of losing the crop by shaking winds or early
frosts.  And in an exigence, plenty of hands can always be
got from Dundee to cut down the crops speedily.  Many
of the people look upon it as a great inconvenience, to pay
toll, when they scarcely touch upon the turnpike, and while
their own bye-roads are almost impassable; but it is to be
hoped this disadvantage will soon be removed.

   Manufactures.-Dighty, the only river in the parish,
drives more machinery for its size than, perhaps, any water
in Britain; every fall upon it turns a mill; so that
within this parish, though not above 4 miles in length,
there are no sewer than 33 mills erected for different pur-
poses.  There are several corn mills, barley mills, and
mills for washing and cleaning yarn.  There is one erect-
ing at present for spinning flax, upon a capital of L. 4000,
which, it is supposed, will give bread to a great number
of both young and old people, and bring considerable emo-
luments to the proprietors; one frame is already up, by
