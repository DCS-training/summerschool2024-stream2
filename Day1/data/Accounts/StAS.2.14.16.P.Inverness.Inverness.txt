  Modern Buildings.-The principal proprietors in the parish
have mansion houses on their properties, some of which are hand-
some, and all genteel and commodious; the largest and.most elegant
of which are Culloden House, Darochville, now the seat ofthe Right
Honourable Lady Saltoun, Muirtown House, Raigmore House, and
the beautifully situated mansion of Dochfour. On the summit of
the Castlehill of Inverness a suit of county buildings for court rooms
and public offices are now in course of being erected after a de-
sign by Mr Burn of Edinburgh, in imitation of some of the large
English castles, and when finished, from ' their commanding situa-
tion, elegance of workmanship, and the variety and beauty of the
different compartments, they will be surpassed by few public build-
ings in the kingdom. It is computed that they will cost about
L.7000, to be defra ed by an assessment on the county, and space
has been left adjoining them for the addition of a new jail in a
similar style of architecture, for the criminals of the northern coun-
ties, so soon as funds can be collected, and the conditions of its
erection decided upon. On the height immediatel to the south
of the Castlehill, a neat edifice has been also recently erected for the
United Charity Institutions of Inverness, consistin of an Jnfant
school on Mr Wilderspin's plan, a female school, a female work

neighbourhood of the town, the building is about to be surmounted
with a small octagonal tower and dome, to be fitted up as an observa-
tory, and for which funds have been provided by subscription. Inthe
year 1804, an Infirmary for the use of the northern counties was
finished, which stands in a healthy and delightful situation, on the
west bank of the River Ness, and is the only public building in the
parish out of the town. Its history and usefulness are glanced at
afterwards. The principal buildings within the burgh are the two
parish churches, the Episcopal and other chapels, of which there
are five, all neat and plain edifices; jhe Town Hall, erected in 1708,
having in front of it the Exchange, with the ancient Town Cross
and Clach-na-cudden, or "Stone of the Tubs," the palladium of
the burgh, and on which the predecessors of the present race of
maid-servants'were wont in ancient days to rest their water-pails

is attached a remarkably handsome spire 150 feet high ;-the Aca-
