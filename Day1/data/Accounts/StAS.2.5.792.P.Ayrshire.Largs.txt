   Conchology.--There is at Largs a post-tertiary deposit, rich in
subfossil shells, which the Misses Muir of Warriston have ex-
plored with great zeal.  The number of species already found in
it (though it was but lately discovered by Mr Landsborough of Ste-
venston), amounts to sixty-eight.  These are all scientifically ar-
ranged, and, with a few exceptions, named, in the cabinet of the
Misses Muir.  Some of the rarest were sent to London to James
Smith, Esq. of Jordanhill, who is very distinguished in this de-
partment of science; and he and other metropolitan geologists and
conchologists say, that two of them are new-hitherto unknown.
They are Rissoae, one of them resembling the Rissoa Harveyii of
W. Thompson, Belfast.  The whole list would occupy too much
space, so that we shall give only a part of it :

Pectunculus pilosus       ------ calathisca	     Bulla truncata, &c.

   There is a post-tertiary deposit at Fairlie, which is seen in the
bank of the burn nearly as high up as the old castle.  It has not
been explored, but the shells which appear in the section of the
bank are all of the common littoral kinds.
