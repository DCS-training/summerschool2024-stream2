There are a few Cameronians and some Episcopalians, and also
4 families of Roman Catholics who came lately from the High-
lands.-The people of this parish are regular in perform-
ing all the external duties of religion, and are in general sober,
industrious, and frugal.  Among several of them, however,
the effects of the distillery of malt spirits, that was carried on
to a great extent in Thornhill, before the act restricting it to
stills of a very large capacity was passed, are still discernible,
in that want of veracity, and of respect for the law, that pro-
pensity to intemperance, to fraud and pilfering, which the su-
perabundance of spirituous liquors, and the habits of defraud-
ing Government have so strong a tendency to produce.-

position for the excite duties, has, however, very wisely re-
moved the temptations to fraud.
   The total annual amount of the emoluments of the parish
schoolmaster does not (exlusive of a house and garden) exceed
L. 25 sterling.-There are besides five private schools, which
in winter are well attended, but in summer almost deserted,
the children being then engaged in keeping cows and other ru-
ral employments.  The number of scholars attending them
in winter exceeds 300*.

sions of the country for restraining the poor from begging,
and obliging their respective parishes to maintain them, this
parish, with a few others in the neighbourhood, assessed them-
selves for the maintenance of the poor, who had formerly

*There is only one ale house in the country part of the parish.  In Thorn-
hill there are seven.  They produce very pernicious effects there, as they do
every where else, where they are kept for any other purpose than for the ac-
commodation of travellers, or of people on business; especially when the inn-
keepers are low persons.
