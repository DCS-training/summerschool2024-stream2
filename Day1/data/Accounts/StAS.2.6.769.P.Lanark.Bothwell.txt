   The three summer months of 1831 were clear and fine, with
very little rain.  In May the average height of the barometer was
29.87; in June 29.89, and in July 29.808.  The extreme range of
the thermometer in May, was from 45 to 63; its average height
in the morning was 57 ; in the evening 48.9.  In June it averag-
ed in the morning 66, and in the evening 58; and in July, in the
morning 65; in the evening 59.  The warmest day in June was
the 4th; the thermometer standing at 78.  On the 7th of July it
reached the same degree.
   A rain-gage of a superior construction has been kept at Both-
well Castle for some years.  It is placed at an elevation of about
80 feet above the level of the sea.  For the last two years the in-
strument has been in an imperfect state of repair.  The follow-
ing are the notations in 1834, when it was in good condition, and
regularly observed.

   Dr MacCulloch observes, " the air is good and the climate health-
ful.  A ridge of high hills about ten miles north carries off the
clouds and vapour that may be raised from the Atlantic, or other-
wise.  A long stretch of high ground does the same service on the
south, and the parish, on account of its separate state, happily re-
mains affected, while the storm is driving along both."
   The most frequent winds in all this district are the west and
south-west.  These prevail generally for about two-thirds of the
year; and chiefly during the latter part of the summer months,
and the autumn and winter seasons.  A cold dry wind from the
east and north-east is not unusual in the beginning of March,
and at that period is of great benefit in preparing the ground for
the seed, and forwarding the operations of the husbandman.  The
same wind prevails not unfrequently in May, and during the ear-
lier part of June; and then its visits are far from being equally
welcome.  When of long continuance it checks the crops in their
growth, withers the blossom of the orchards, and blasts the pros-
pects of the cultivator and the fruit-merchant.
   The weather is generally fine when the wind is south-east, but
if it does rain, the storms are heavy and of long, continuance.  On
