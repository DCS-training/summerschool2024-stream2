while there are upwards of 60,000 acres that have never been under
tillage, 200 of which might be reclaimed at an expense of from
L.12 to L.16 per acre.  There are about 100 acres of natural
wood, consisting almost entirely of birch, with a few ash, alder, and
rowan-tree or mountain-ash.
	Rent of Land.--When the arable land bears so small a propor-
tion to the waste, it is impossible to say what the average rent of
the former is; but it is generally considered not worth more than
15s. per acre, the hill pasture in many small farms being given
along with it.
	Rate of Waqes.--Labourers, besides victuals, get from l0d. to
Is. per day during winter, and from Is. to ls. 3d. per day during
summer;--carpenters, masons, &c. generally receiving about twice
as much. Farm-servants and shepherds get from L.5 to L.7
during the half year; and female servants, during the same period,
from L.2 to L.3, 1Os., exclusive of victuals.
	Breeds of Live-Stock.--Much attention has of late been paid
to the breeding of cattle, horses, and sheep. The two former are
of the Angus breed, but the cattle are small; the latter, principally
black,f`ced, are bought in the south country when lambs, at from L. 5
to L.7 and L.8 the clad score. About 3,000 lambs are reared
from ewes within the parish. To encourage the rearing of sheep
within the parish, or the importation from the south country, Lord
Panmure has, with his usual liberality, established an annual show
at Millden, where he gives prizes to those of his tenants who bring
forward the best samples of sheep.
	Husbandry.--Most of the farmers observe a rotation of six years
in cropping, viz. a white, a green, two white, and two grass crops.
All the new leases are for nineteen years; but there are still a few
liferenters in the parish. There are a very few enclosures; and, in
general, the farm-houses and steadings are in good repair, and are
upheld by the tenants. Great improvements have of late years
been made by many individuals in trenching baulks &c. and in
making close fields.
