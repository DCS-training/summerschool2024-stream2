     PARISH OF CALLANDER.

     (Presbytery of Dumblane-County of Perth-Synod of Perth
     and Stirling.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JAMES ROBERTSON, Minister of that
     Parish.

     Etymology of the Name.

   THE etymology of Callander is by some understood
to be from Calla-Straid, which is the Gaelic name
given to it by the common people:  Calla, signifying the
landing place at the Ferry, where the village is built; and
Straid, the street or avenue leading from the castle of Callan-
der to the same ferry.  By others, it is thought to refer to a
more remote period than the existence of the castle, or any ave-
nue in this country, and to be derived from Caldin-doir, which
is also a Gaelic word, and signifies the hazle grove.  From the
remains of hazle woods in this neighbourhood, and the aptness
of this kind of soil to carry hazle and oak, it is probable, that
not only this place, but other places, which have a similar
name, originally abounded, or do still abound with that
timber.
