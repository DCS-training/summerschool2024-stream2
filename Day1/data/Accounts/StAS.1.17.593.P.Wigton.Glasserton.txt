     of Glasserton.

   Mr Stewart of Castle-Stewart does not, indeed, reside upon
his estate in this parish; bur it is in his absence, under the
management of Matthew Campbell, Esq; a gentleman well ac-
quainted with the best husbandry of England, and of this
country; and most laudably zealous to improve the agricul-
ture of the county, and the value of the estates under his
care.  In granting leases, and in all his arrangements with
the tenants, he earnestly endeavours to hold out such en-
couragements, and to impose such restrictions, as may
best overcome obstinate prejudices in favour of old unskil-

landlord.

   Price Labour.-The price of labour would probably be
much higher than it is, at present, in this parish, and
throughout the county, were it not for the near vicinity of
Ireland, and the continual emigration of great numbers of
Irish labourers.  A stout, alert, and skilful ploughman re-
ceives, together with his board in his master's house, 4 L.
sterling of wages, in the half year.  A good maid-servant's
wages are usually from thirty to forty shaillings in the half
year, beside her board.  Few or no artisans reside within
this parish, except such as are employed solely in the custo-
mer-work of their fellow-parishioners, and other near neigh-
bouts.  Their wages are in a due proportion to those of the
kinds engaged in farm-labour.

   Church, etc.-The church stands near to Glasserton.  House,
and is romantically embosomed in wood, which sheds around
it a venerable gloom, as if it were a druidical temple, or the
sacred grove of some Syrian idol.  It was built in the year
1752.  The wood was at a much later period,planted around
