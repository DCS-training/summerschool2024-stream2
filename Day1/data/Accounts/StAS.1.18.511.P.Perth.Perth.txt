     of Perth.

   An extensive bleachfield has long been established, upon
the canal from the Almond, at the village of Tulloch, which
has thereby become considerable.  Muirton of Balhousie, is
the largest and most populous of any of the villages.
   I forbear to mention the suburbs, or the streets and portions
of land which lie on the outside of the ancient line of the
walls of the town.  It is difficult in some instances to deter-
mine which of them are not, and which of them are really
comprehended in the royalty.
   The parish of Perth is so much occupied, and so much
surrounded through a great extent of the country, with en-
tailed estates, that the merchants, who have succeeded in
trade, are discouraged from laying out their money in the
purchase of lands.  Some of them have been obliged to pur-
chase estates at a considerable distance.

     SS11.  Trade.

   In the early times Perth was a place of great trade.  Alex-
ander Necham, an English writer, who read lectures at Paris
in 1180, was made Abbot of Exeter in 1215, and died in
1227, takes notice of Perth in the following distich, quoted
in Camden's Britannia.

   "Transis ample Tai, per rura, per oppida, per Perth.
   "Regnum sustentant illius urbis opes."

   Thus Englished in Bishop Gibson's Translation of Camden's
Book.

   "Great Tay through Perth, through towns, through countryflies.
   "Perth the whole Kingdom with her wealth supplies."

   The literal version is, "Go on great Tay, through fields,
"through towns, through Perth.  The wealth of that city
"supports the kingdom."
