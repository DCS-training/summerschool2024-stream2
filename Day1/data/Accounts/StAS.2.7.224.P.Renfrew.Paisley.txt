pletely, escaped any admixture of Episcopal leaven.  This volume
closes with the minute of 26th October 1699.
   The fifth volume, already mentioned, contains the minutes from
16th October 1663, to 7th September 1687.  The history of this
volume, which contains the minutes of proceedings during the Epis-
copal period, is also somewhat singular.  We have already no-
ticed the unsuccessful inquiry made by our fathers after the mi-
nutes of this period.  After a lapse of nearly a century and a-half,
Mr Douglas, then presbytery clerk, the present minister of Kilbar-
chan, having got a slight hint of a volume having been seen in a
private library, belonging to a family in Lorn, apparently forming
part of the records of the presbytery of Paisley, immediately insti-
tuted a correspondence on the subject, and after the lapse of a
considerable time, during which his correspondence was going
on, he had the satisfaction of delivering it up to the presbytery
about twelve years ago, for which he received from that court an
unanimous vote of thanks.  How this volume found its way to
Lorn, we cannot say;.but Mr Douglas in a note to us, says, " this
light volume (for it is not at all ponderous) had found its way, I
presume, to that district of Argyllshire, through some one clergy-
man or layman, a retainer of the Episcopal church, who seems to
have inferred his title to retain the record in question, on the same
principle on which more important documents found their way to
Zion College." *
   The sixth volume commences 7th November 1699, and ter-
minates with the minute of 10th September 1707;
   The seventh volume brings down the minutes from 7th Octo-
bar 1707, to 18th July 1722: the eighth from 8th August 1722,
to, 19th of March 1735; the ninth, from 1st April 1735, to 26th
September 1752; the tenth, from 25th October 1752, to 23d
October 1774; the eleventh, from 30th November 1774, to 7th
July 1790; the twelfth, from 5th August 1790, to 4th Septem-
ber 1800; the thirteenth, from 3d December 1800, to 7th May
1823; and the fourteenth, from 4th June 1823, to the date of

<FOOTNOTE>The first notice of this volume, Mr Douglas had from Mr Storie, of Roseneath,
and his correspondence was with Dr Campbell of Kilninver, and Hugh M'Lach
lan, Esq, writer, Glasgow, the last of whom is the person whom put it into his hands,
It is singular enough that it should be to the minister of Kilbarchan, the presbytery
are indebted for the recovery of both of these volumes.  May we not hope, that he or,
our present presbytery clerk may yet get some " slight hint," which may lead to the
recovery of a volume, which at present seems to be lost, containing the minutes be-
tween 1607 and 1626, and which ought to be the second volume of the records?
