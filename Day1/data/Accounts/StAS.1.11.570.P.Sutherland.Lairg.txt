of what is called a kindly, or sweet grass, but a vail deal of
heath and coarse grass.

   Climate.-The climate is rainy; but though the air is very
damp, there is no distemper peculiar to the parish.  The in-
habitants, having the greatest abundance of peats, take care to
keep a good fire without, and, as often as they can get at
spiritous liquors, they will kindle a fire within; nor do they
apprehend more danger to their constitutions from the one

   River, Fish, Lake, Wood, etc.-There is no river of any
note, except the river Shin; which, running out of the E. end
of the loch of that name, for about a mile, comes upon a most
tremendous rock, of about 20 feet high, and runs over it
in a prodigious cascade.  The old method of killing the sal-

coarser fish than any other in Scotland), was by thrusting a
long creel or basket in behind the cascade, at the soot of the
rock, and every fish that jumped to get up, was sure to fall in
the basket, and kill itself by the fall.  When the river hap-
pened to be very high, a few of the lightest fish would get over
the cascade, and make their way to the lake, which was per-
haps the circumstance that preserved the breed, the whole run
of the water, from the great fall, being so extremely rough
and rapid, that there is no sand nor gravel to protect the spawn;
but the fishing company have now erected cruives upon the
Shin, near the place where it discharges itself into the Kyle
of Sutherland.-Loch-Shin is a fine sheet of water, of about
20 miles long, and not above 2 broad.  There is a good wood,
chiefly birch, on the S. side of it, belonging to Mr. Munro of
Pointzfield, and some on the N. side, too, at the place called
