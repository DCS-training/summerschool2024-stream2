the island, to ascertain this fact.  i saw one in this country
opened, in which there was found a great number of hu-
man bones.  There were two white cairns opened in this
parish; in the middle of each there was found a grave,
formed of flag-stones, containing an urn with burnt bones in
it.-In the tumulus, the body had been buried in the earth;
in the cairns, the body had been mostly consumed by fire
before burial.
   To conclude, this parish, after supplying its inhabitants,
affords a considerable quantity of grain, great numbers of
sheep and black-cattle, and a considerable quantity of wool,
to be disposed of annually in other markets.  Besides these
primary advantages, it affords abundance of amusement to
the sportsman and the angler.
