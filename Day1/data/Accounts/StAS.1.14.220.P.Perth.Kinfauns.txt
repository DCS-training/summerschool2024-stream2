     Statistical Account

   The general contents of the parish, are about 378.
Scotch acres; of which 2520 are arable, excepting a very
small proportion.  The remaining 1260 acres, are under
plantations.  These run along the tops and front of the
hills, and consist mostly of mostly of Scotch sir, with laxires, beech
oak, and other forest trees intermixed.

   Horses and Black Cattle.-As no black cattle are em-
ployed here in operations of husbandry, not many, ex-
cepting cows, are reared.  Some young stots, or win-
terings, as they are commonly called, are bought in for
eating up the fodder in winter, and are sold, or sent off
to grass in summer.  Horses are, for the most part,
bought; few are reared.  Besides what gentlemen keep
for their own private use, the number of sheep is but
small.  Cows and cattle, at present, amount to 400:
there are 186 horses, and about 90 sheep.

   Population.-There is good reason to believe, that this
parish is not now so populous as formerly.  The rapid
success of the manufactures, which has drawn the people
from the country to the towns, is one great cause of de-
population.  Uniting small possessions, or cross, into
farms, is another; and the disuse of cottagers, as farm-
ing servants, has also contributed to the same effect.  It
has become much the practice, of late years, to employ
unmarried men as farming servants; of course cotta-
gers, and their houses, have, in some degree, disppear-
ed*.
