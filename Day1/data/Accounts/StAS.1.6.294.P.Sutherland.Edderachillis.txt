physician, at his own request, by one of the Stewarts, Kings of Scotland,
whom he had cured of some distemper.  This Ferrhard was physician to the
M'Kays of Far; and received from them, in exchange for his right to these
islands, a piece of ground near Tongue, called Melness, where he lived him-
self, and some of his offspring after him; but the M'Kays found means
to recover possession of Melness long since; and yet it is said Ferchard's
posterity remain still in the country under the name of M'Kay.
There is yet one small island in a fresh water loch, that deserve some no-
tice, one account of memorable events that happened in it.  It lies in
Loch-Stack, so termed from a mountain having the figure of a stack of
corn, but of immense height, near it.  In this small island M'Kay Laird of
Far, chief of the name, had a hunting house with a small garden, which on
occasion of his visiting the distant parts of his forest in the hunting season,

of a man occupying the next farm or grazing called Loan, who seems to have
been of the better fort, came to him with her present also; and being a young
woman, and as it would seem of uncommon beauty; Sir Hugh took a fancy
for her person, wanting her to gratify his sensual inclinations; but she re-

a base deed, while her own husband lived, and so wanting to return home
she found she would not be permitted to leave the island.  Next day Sir
Hugh, with one or more attendants, took a walk towards the house, where
the husband lived, and desired him to come along with thema as they return-
ed to the Island, which as he was doing, either Sir Hugh himself, or some
of his company, stepping behind, all at once ran him through the body with
a durk, took off the head, which they brought carefully along with them,
and upon their return presented to his wife.  Then the poor woman fear-
