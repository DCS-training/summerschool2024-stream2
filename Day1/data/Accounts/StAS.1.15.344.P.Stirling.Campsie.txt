   There is scarcely any land in the strath of the parish let
below 1 L. per acre.  The brae farms, and the pasture land,
are let by slump; it is impossible to say what they rent per
acre.
   It may be proper here to take notice, that lime, though in
such great abundance in this parish, was made but little use
of as a manure till very lately; the inhabitants pretended e-
ven to say that spoiled the ground by raising weeds: the
truth is, the objection lay in their injudicious management;
there is not the smallest doubt, where ground is foul, as is
the case in the soil and moist climate of Campsie, that lime
puts the weeds in vegetation; but if the land had been fal-
lowed, or even permitted to lie long in ley, till the ground
was properly swarded, there is no country in Scotland, where
liming produces a better effect, than in this district:  As some
recent experiments have shown, we now lime at the rate of
from six to eight chalders per acre.  Such being the state of
agriculture in this parish, it may be said, without disparage-
ment, that it is, as yet, but in its infancy; and yet it is but do-
ing justice, both to the proprietors and tenants, to observe,
that the improvements are going on with great spirit and suc-
cess.

   Grazing.-There is considerable attention paid in this
district to the management of black cattle, both for the pur-
poses of the dairy, and likewise for that of the butcher.  The
following table exhibits the number of cattle and sheep kept
in the parish in 1793.
