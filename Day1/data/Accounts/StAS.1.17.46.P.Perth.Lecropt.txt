N. to S.  It contains about 2000 acres of ground, one half
of which is a rich clay, the other half up-land, or what is
generally called dry field.  The clay soil on the south is di-
vided from the up land by a beautiful bank, which crosses the
parish, almost parallel to the north side, and nearly at one
third of the distance between it and the southern extremity.
-In all the clay land there is not a single stone or pebble;

lofty trees, through which the smoke ascends from the dwel-

perations of agriculture, beautify and enrich the scene.-On
the opposite side of this fertile valley, the Castle of Stirling
rears its head in rude magnificence, on the summit of a rock,
and leads the mind to review the history of years that are
past, when it was the residence of the antient kings of Scot-
land.  The huge rock of Craigforth on the one side of the
Castle, and the Abbey Craig on the other, form, with the
Castle itself, three vast and detached piles, about the
distance of a mile from each other; and, like the pyramids
