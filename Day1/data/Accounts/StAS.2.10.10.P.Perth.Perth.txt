		The mean pressure, derived from the means of the months, is
        29,802 by the observations at nine A.M.; and 29,808 by the observations
	at half-past eight P.M. The extreme range of the
	means, on either side of the mean for the entire period of observation,
	or the differences, in excess and defect, between the latter
	mean, and the greatest and least means of each month, during the
	six years of observation, are, in reference to the morning observations
	as follows:
