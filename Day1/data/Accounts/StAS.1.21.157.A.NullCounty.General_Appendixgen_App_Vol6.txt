leaves.  This it is evident would produce a great stagnation
of water, which, as the crops of bent-grass accumulated,
would still increase: and the probability is, that at length it
had so increased, as to be the cause why the bent-grass and
other congenial plants of the first stratum ceased to grow.
But it is evident that a plant was to be found that could live
in such a situation.  Accordingly we see that bog-moss had
established itself; a plant that loves even to swim in water.
   When the accumulations of bent-grass and the mosses had,
in process of time, arisen to the height of six feet above the
surrounding carse ground, the water that fell upon the sur-
face had by that means an opportunity to discharge itself.  It
has accordingly formed many channels, which are often three
feet deep; and the intermediate surface being wholly turned
into little hillocks has become dry and firm.  By this means
it became unfit for mosses, and heath succeeded.
   Such seems to have been the process in the formation
of what is now called a moss.
   By far the greatest part of the moss in question is, upon
an average, full seven feet deep, and has in all probability
lain undisturbed since its formation: this is called the High
Moss.  The remainder, called the Low Moss, lies to a consi-
derable breadth around the extremities of the high; and
is, upon an average, not above three feet in depth, to which
it has been reduced by the digging of peats.  These are
formed of that stratum of the moss only that lies four feet
below the surface and downwards; the rest is improper for
the purpose, and is thrown aside.
   Before the introduction of the plan which is now pursu-
ed, two methods chiefly were employed to gain land from
the moss.  1st, The surrounding farmers marked off yearly.
a portion of the Low Moss next to their arabic land, about
15 feet broad.  This they removed with carts and spread
