the banks rise, with a very bood and quick ascent, to a consi-
derable height, and are in many places steep and full of precipi-
ces.  From their summits, the land rises very moderately, and a-
gain falls a little, upon the west of the parish.  The highest
part of the land is computed to be about 400 feet above the
level of the sea.  The soil of the upper ground, in general, is
a very strong heavy clay, lying upon a stratum of a dense argi-
laceous sustance, generally of a great depth; which, under all
its different appearances, is called till in this country, there
being only a few exceptions, of small spots of a more light and
open quality.  The clay soil, in its natural state, appears very
sterile, bearing only straggling bushes of surze, with some-
times broom, and a small quantity of course herbage:  But,
by a course of cultivation, and repeated manuring with lime
and dung, it is brought to yield good crops of corn and grass.
Some of the steep banks, already mentioned, along the side
of the Clyde, are uncovered, and but slightly cultivated;
some of them are clothed with beautiful coppice woods; as are
also many of the other steep declivities, upon the sides of the
other rivers, brooks, and torrents.  On the upper parts of the
parish, are large artificial plantations and stripes of trees; on
the lower, considerable orchards are planted:  The rest of the
parish is all arable, except a small extent of moss.

   River.-The Clyde, which forms the bourdary of the
parish, on one side; the Avon, which runs along the well
side of it for two miles, and the small river, Calner, are the
principal streams.  The bold rocky banks of the Avon, cover-
ed with wood, are beautifully romantic.  In the Clyde and
Avon, salmon, trout, pike ecls, etc. are found, and in the
Calner, some trout.  The rains sometimes occasion great
floods in the rivers.  The Clyde, at particular times, rises so
high as to overflow, and do great injury to the land in the
