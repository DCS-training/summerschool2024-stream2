     Statistical Account

ster in 1755, however, was 1679.  About the end of last
war, some individuals went to North America, a few of whom
returned and settled at home, bringing bad tidings of the coun-
try, which their imaginations had figured to be the fairy-land
of wealth.  Since that time, those who would have gone to
America, had the prospect been favourable, have preferred a
home emigration to the southern parts of Scotland, particularly
Glasgow, Paisley, &c.  And from this part of the north, there
is, and always has been, a constant succession of adventurers
issuing forth to the British capital, the East and West Indies,
and other parts of the empire.  There are 6 heritors in this
parish.  By far the greatest part of the people, are employed
in agriculture*.

   Trade.-There is a village, called Burgh-head, upon the coast,
containing 400 souls, more than two thirds of whom follow a
sea-faring life.  Most of the rest are quarriers and stone masons.
Here there are a few small boats employed in fishing, and 7
large boats are hired to the fishing on the west coast, on board
each of which there are fix people.  Five large boats, with
fix people in each, are also employed in transporting stones
from the quarries, to different parts of the country.  Two
sloops are employed, chiefly in carrying grain to the south of
Scotland, and in bringing back coals.

   Imports and Exports.-The principal imports are coals,
mostly from Northumberland; and merchant goods, chiefly
from London.  Our exports are men, grain, linen yarn, and a
few black cattle.  The first and the last go chiefly to England,
especially to the London market.  The grain and yarn go to
the south of Scotland.
