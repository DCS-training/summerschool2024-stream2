made to raise flax; but not with much success, as the people
do not understand the management of it*.

   Rent.-The valued rent of the whole parish amounts to
L. 4309: 19 Scotch money; and the real rent may be at pre-
sent about L. 2000 sterling, including farm victual.  The
rent has been rising for these 20 years past.  Of late it has
risen astonishingly.  For example, an estate in this parish was
lately bought for L. 7000 that 25 years ago was offered to be
sold for 2000 guineas: that estate, however, now pays nine times
the rent it paid at that period.  Another estate has been lately sold
for L. 4300, which, not above 30 years ago, was bought for
little more than L. 750: and several farms in this parish pay
now three times as much rent as they paid 7 years ago.  This
rapid advance of the value of land may be chiefly owing to the
easy access to lime, which is the first great mean of improve-
ment; and also, to the superior skill the farmers have acquired
in the management of their ground, which makes them more
industrious and enterprising than they formerly were+.-

character to say, that the farmers owe their superior skill and management to
