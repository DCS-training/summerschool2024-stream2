                   The heritors would not only improve the general appearance of
                 the parish, but advance their own interest, were they to encou-
                 rage farmers to enclose their fields, either by remunerating the
                 tenant at the termination of his lease for improvements and
                 expenditures, or by being themselves at the expense of enclosures
                 and subdivisions, and charging interest for the money expended
                 to accommodate the farmer.
                   A few fishing villages established along the coast of a parish which
                 abound& with a variety of nutritive fish, and a small croft of land,
                 with pasture for a couple of cows and a horse to each family, would
                 not only support the superabundant population of cottagers, but
                 prevent a spirit of emigration, which is becoming too prevalent
                 among the Highland peasantry ; not an individual of whom would
                 relinquish their bills and glens, to which they are attached by the
                 dearest ties, could any reasonable prospect of employment and
                 support be held out to them in their native land.
                   Since education has become more generally diffused, the majo-
                 rity of the natives can converse a little in the English language,
                 but Gaelic is the prevailing dialect, in which all business is trans-
                 acted.

                  Education.-The parishioners have, within the last ten years,
                 manifested an ardent desire to give their children a liberal educa-
                 tion ; and the advantages resulting from it are beginning to produce
                 a perceptible change upon their morals.  Six-and-thirty years ago,
                 scarcely three out of ten could write or sign their names; but now)
                 as the old generation are gradually dying away, their descendants
                 are rapidly acquiring those branches of education taught in the
                 parish schools, such as reading, writing, -arithmetic, book-keeping,
                 English grammar, geography, and sometimes navigation.
                  Eight schools are at present taught in the parish, viz. two pa-
                 rochial, with the maximum salary divided between two teachers;
                 one supported by the Society for Propagating Christian Know-
                 ledge, with a salary of L 17 Sterling, a free house, and two and
                 a-half acres of mortified land; Qne endowed by the Committee of

                 and a salary of L.25 Sterling per annum; and four unendowed
                 schools, supported byindividual subscriptions.

                 eburches, kept.in a good state of repair, conveniently enough
