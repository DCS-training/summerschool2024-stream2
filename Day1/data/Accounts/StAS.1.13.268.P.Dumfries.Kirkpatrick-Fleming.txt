has also marble been found upon the same estate, which,
though only polished in part, had a very beautiful and
variegated appearance.  There is some appearance of coal
in this parish, and though hitherto without success, repeat-
edly attempts have been made to discover it.  But whe-
ther really no coal doth here exist, or the efforts hither-
to made, have been effectual attempts to discover.
   The parish abounds with freestone, very different both
in quality and colour; in that part of the parish called
Kirkconnell, the freestone is of a grey colour, porous,
but hard and durable; in Kirkpatrick, and especially up-
on the banks of Kirtle, the freestone is of a dark red co-

to split into boards 3 quarters of an inch in thickness, which
are used as a slate for covering houses.  But the principal
freestone here is found upon the estate of Cove; it is
nearly of a white colour, admits of a fine polish, and is
very durable.  It is applied in all the neighbouring pa-
rishes, for slagging houses, for stairs, pillars, tomb-stones,
etc. for many years past; at an average, not less than
125 tons of it dressed into flags, have been shipped for
Ireland, and 60 tons have been confumed in the country
annually.  Blocks of stone have been raised in the quarry,
which measured 34 cubic feet, and considerably above two
tons in weight.  The quarry was rented at L. 11 a-year,
but is now out of leafe.-The fuel chiefly used by the he-
ritors who reside in this parish is coal, which is generally
carried from the Duke of Buccleugh's collieries, in the 
parish of Cannobie.  Owing to the scarcity there at times,
on account of the increasing demand of late years, and
miserable management which for some years these collie-
ries have been under, many are obliged to carry their coal
from Tindall Fell in Cumberland, though an inferior coal,
