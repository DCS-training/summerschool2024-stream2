   Wages, Cottagers, etc.-A ploughman's usual wages are
from L. 4, 10 s. to L. 8, according to his character for care
and skill; those of women servants, L. 2, 10 s. or L. 3; a
good wright or mason's wages, in summer, are 1 s. 6 d. in
winter, 1 s. 2 d.; a tailor's, 6 d. or 8 d. with victuals.  The
people are industrious, and there is only 1 ale-house.  Cot-
tagers generally hold the farmers ploughs, get livery meal,
have an acre of land, a house, and small garden, and furnish
2 reapers in harvest.  There are several threshing machines
here; but they seem, as yet, to save only a lot-man, as he
is called, who threshes for so much the boll.  These ma-
chines are useful, when a merchant offers for barley or
wheat, and who would not wait the slow progress of a lot-
man; for the machines can thresh 40 bolls in a day.

   Church, Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-The church and
manse are in pretty good order.  The stipend is between
L. 70 and L. 80, with 4 acres of a good glebe.  The Crown
is patron.  There are 3 heritors, none of whom reside.  The
schoolmaster's salary is only about 100 merks.  The poor
are supplied by the weekly collections, and interest of
poors money.

   Remarks on the State of the Clergy and Schoolmasters.-Un-
less a general augmentation of stipends becomes an object to
