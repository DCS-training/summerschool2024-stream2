             I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name, Boundaries, &c.-KILMOR9 is derived froin the Gaelic
words, Kil, signifying a buryiDg-place, and mor, large, or Kil and
Muire, a burying-place dedicated to the Virgin Marv. Kilbride
signifies a burying-place dedicated to St Bridget.
Kilmore and Kilbride are supposed to have been united soon
after the Reformation ; the former was a parsonage and the latter
a vicarage. Kilmore is the presbytery seat.
   The united parish is bounded on the east, by the parishes of
Kilchrenan and Muckairn ; on the north and west, by Lochetive
and the Sound of Mull; and on the south, by Lochfeochan and
the parish of Kilninver. Its extent from east to west is about 12
miles, and from north to south 9 miles. The island of Kerrera
which forms part of the parish, is situated to the north-west, and
separated from the mainland by a Darrow sound. Its length is 3
miles and breadth nearly 2.
   Topogyraphical Appearances.-The general appearance of the
parish is hilly ; the, hills, however, are not high, and the valleys
between them are cultivated and fertile. The soil is in general
light and samdy. A considerable extent of moss remains still un-
improved; part of it might be cultivated with advantage.
