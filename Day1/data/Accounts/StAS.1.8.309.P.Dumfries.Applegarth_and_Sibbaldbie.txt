Liverpool, and the oat meal to Greenock, to supply Glasgow,
Paisley, and the west country, from which there is sometimes
a considerable demand.  The lands in the parish, in general,
are good, especially upon the banks of Annan and Dryfe.
There is a good deal of what is called holm land, which bears
very good crops of barley and oats.  Sowing of wheat is not
much used in the parish, nor in this part of the country.
Lime, which is now greatly used as a manure, is brought, at
the distance of 12 miles, from the southermost part of the pa-
rish, and is also carried to the high grounds, where the lost is
not so good; and in general good crops are produced after
liming.

   Roads, etc.-The great turn-pike road from Carlisle to
Glasgow and Edinburgh, passes through the parish, from
south to north, about six miles.  This road was made about
15 years ago, and has been of the highest advantage to he im-
provement of this neighbourhood.  A mail coach, from London
to Glasgow, passes through the parish, every day, along the
said turn-pike road; and carriers almost daily from Glasgow
w Carlisle, and the manufacturing towns in England.  There
is a stage in the parish, viz. Dinwoodie Green, where the
mail coach stops and changes horses.  This stage is only 5
miles distant from the village of Lockerby, where there is
post office, 11 miles from Ecclesfechan, and 11 from Moffat,
which are also stages, and have post offices.  Through the lat-
ter village, a diligence passes from Dumfries to Edinburgh,
3 times a-week, which renders travelling from this part of
the country, to Edinburgh and Glasgow, very easy and con-
venient.  The parish is distant from Edinburgh about 60
miles, and nearly an equal distance from Glasgow.

   Proprietors and Rent.-There are six heritors in the parish,
