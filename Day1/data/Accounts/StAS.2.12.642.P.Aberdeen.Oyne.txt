   The oxen now reared are chiefly for sale to the butcher, and are
generally fed and parted with in their third or fourth year; whereas
formerly they were kept for ploughing, ten of them being yoked in
pairs by bows around the necks, and dragging by a long iron chain,
(called the soum,) a heavy and clumsy wooden plough, with un-
equal stilts.  These were larger of their kind than the horses,
and more liberally fed ; but, being kept for eight years and upwards,
and inured to labour, their flesh was not so rich and nourishing as
that of the cattle now reared and fed in the country.
   Few sheep comparatively are now kept, and these are of the black-
faced kind on the hill, and of a larger and mixed breed on the low
grounds, for the sake of lambs and wool.  The breed of swine has
been much improved ; for, instead of the high-backed, long-nosed,
and strong-bristled animals, formerly known as " mill swine," the
pigs are now a short-legged cross from the continental breeds, feed-
ing to six, eight, or ten stones in the first year, and sold at that
age for the London market.
   Husbandry.-The state of husbandry in this parish, and through-
out the district of Garioch and the county generally, must be
reckoned good, when the peculiarities of the soil, climate, and
markets are duly estimated, insomuch that very few tenants, who
have come from more favoured counties to farm here, have been
able to effect, with advantage to themselves, any material improve-
ments of the system.  The cultivation of waste lands has been
carried on successfully during the last thirty years, being done
piece-meal by individual tenants more than in large tracts by he-
ritors or capitalists ; so that the low grounds, which had once been
covered with natural brush-wood and furze, and thence changed
into turf-bogs, are now under regular tillage for grain and green
crops, and they generally yield an abundant remuneration to the
hand of industry. The means and instruments of husbandry, as
well as the modes of cultivation, have been completely changed,
even within the recollection of the writer.  The number of carts
in 1793 was stated at 50, and that number was comparatively Of
little use in the narrow, steep, and rugged roads, which were then
general ; so that the crop, dung, fuel, and meal were mainly car-
ried on horseback, whereas back-loads are now entirely disused;
and the number of carts of various kinds, for crop and dung, wood,
fuel, and long carriages is greater than that of the horses.  The
plough formerly in use was a lumbering wooden implement, of
rude workmanship, and not unfrequently made at home by the
