Covenant. 1650. William Jack, war, ejected in 1662, and died
at Lanark in 1669. 1663. Mr Birnie was prelatic curate after

notice in Leighton's works: " 17th September 1670. The Lords
of the Council having appointed some ministers from other parts
to preach in such churches within the diocese of Glasgow, as do
most need their help; I desire the Rev. Mr James Aird of Tor-
ry to bestow his pains especially in the kirk of Carluke, for bring-
ing the people to frequent the public ordinances, removing their
prejudices, and cooling their passions." A robbery of the curate of
Carluke is mentioned at a meeting of Covenanters held at Doug-
las in 1689.-(Faithful Contendings, page 368.)-1672. Peter

<FOOTNOTE>On Mr Kid's tombstone in Carluke church-yard was the following epitaph,
now entirely obliterated:
		A faithful, holy pastor here lies bid,
		One of a thousand, Mr Peter Kid,
                Firm as a stone, but of a heart contrite,
                A wrestling, praying, weeping Israelite.
                A powerful preacher, far from ostentation;
                A son of thunder, and of consolation.
                His face, his speech, and humble walk might tell
                That he was in the mount and Peniel.
                He was in Patmos, and did far surpass,
                In fixed steadfastness, the rocky Bass.
                His love to Christ made his life to be spent
                In feeding flocks and kids beside his tent.
                His frail flesh could not equal paces keep
                With his most wlling sp'rit, but fell asleep.
                His soul's in heaven, where it was much before,
                His flesh rests here in hopes of future glore.
                Passenger I ere thou go, sigh, weep and pray.
                Help, Lord, because the godly do decay.
