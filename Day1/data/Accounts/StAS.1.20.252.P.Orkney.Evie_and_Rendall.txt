     Statistical Account

There are different tradespeople in the parish, sufficient to 
serve its purposes; but no manufactory carried on deser-
ving the name, except that of linen-yarn; a very consider-
able quantity of which is spun for sale, besides what is 
wrought up into coarse cloth for the use of the inhabitants,
and for annual exportation to Shetland, Newcastle, etc.
There are also some woollen stuffs manufactured for sale,
besides stuffs, coarse blankets, and woollen cloths, for the 
use of the inhabitants; but there is not one mill for cloth,
nor a person who can dress it up after it is wove, in this pa-
rish, nor even in the county.

   Boats and Fishing.-There are about 30 boats in these
parishes, from 1 1/2 to 2 tons burden, with 4, and a very few 
with 6, oars each.  The fish caught are, excellent cod and 
ling, dogfish and a few skate, hollibat and haddocks, all caught 
with hand-lines; and faithe or colefish of different ages; also 
lobsters and razor or spout-fish, and cockles.  The fishing 
appears to be very much neglected.  As there are no mere-
ly professional fishers, and no ready markets, every man 
fishes for his own family use only, when he can spare time 
from his other avocations. 

   Bars to Improvement.-These are chiefly the intermix-
ture of property and farms, want of inclosures, short, or 
rather no leases, and, above all, the habits and prejudices of 
the inhabitants.  Owing to these, no material improvement 
can take place in the mode of managing the small farms; and 
no encouragement whatever is given by the proprietors to 
induce the farmers to attempt it.  Almost the whole of the 
arable land of these parishes lay formerly in run-rig, as a 
small part of it still does.  Above 30 years ago, a division
took place, but so injudicious, that even where there are large 
and very compact fields belonging to a single proprietor,
