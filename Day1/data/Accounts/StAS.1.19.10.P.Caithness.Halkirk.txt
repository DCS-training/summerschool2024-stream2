     Statistical Account

   All this time I have been giving a description of the
climate of the country in general, when I should have
confined my thoughts to this parish in particular; but this
makes no difference, for almost every particular that is ap-
plicable to this parish, is in a degree less or more applicable
also to the whole country at large.  But to proceed:
   From the mutual influence of the soil and climate on
one another, arise the frosts, the noxious winds, the storms
with which we are visited frequently in April, May, and
sometimes in June; for when the air has a currency from
the N. N.E. and N.W. it scours along the country,
armed and impregnated with all the noxious and nipping
qualities it gathers or contracts in its progress over the
north seas; and these qualities are again seconded and
proved by what, in its progress over the land, it receives
from the wetness and dampness of the soil, and from the
marshes, fens, lakes, and deep moss, with which it abounds
to this also is to be ascribed the frosty and blasting influen-
ces of the air, sometimes in August and often in Septem-
ber.  Hence the vapours, mists, and mildews, which are
sometimes very hurtful in that season of the year, to the
great disappointment of the farmer.  These are no less ini-
mical to the crops of trees and tender vegetables; to the
bud, the foliage, and the tender part of the branches, that
was the growth of the immediately preceding year and
season, than the dampness and shallowness of the soil is to
the root.  But yet I must say, that several fruit-trees, and
other kinds of timber, would grow and thrive here pretty
well, if their crops could be defended and sheltered from
these influences of the N. N.E. and N.W.  I am warranted
in this assertion by observations I have made on a fir ptant-
ing in my neighbourhood, belonging to Sir John Sinclair,
and planted by his father.  About 18 years ago the young
trees made no unpromising appearance; on the contrary,
