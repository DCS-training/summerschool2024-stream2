     Of Cromarty.

tity of goods landed for this place, is proportionally small;
but there is a great increase in the quantity sent to other quar-
ters around, of late years.  The London traders alone annual-
ly carry to the four northern countries, value to the amount of
at least 100,000 L. Sterling*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*There is a custom-house boat stationed here, having a master and fix men
under his command, from all I can learn, smuggling in these quarters is knock-
ed in the head It would be wrong to omit mentioning here, a grievance much
and justly complained of; it is shortly this: That the officers of the customs here
are instructed from the custom-house, to stop all boats freighted with victual,
however small the quantity, unless a regular clearance or permit for such boat
is sent for and obtained from the custom-house at Inverness.  From this prac-
tice, any of the inhabitants of this country who may have occasion to send but 12
bolls of barley across the Frith, up to Inverness, or any of the neighbouring
creeks, are under the unaccountable hardship of detaining their boat until the
return of an express from Inverness, which lies 30 miles distance from many
quarters of the country; and even from this place; the expense incurred by such
a procedure, including the officer's fees, which amount to 11 s. or 12 s., and
paying the express, will be nothing short of 16 s. or 18 s.  This is mentioned,
that the grievance, it not fanctioned by law, as is strongly suspected, may be
checked, and a stop put to any longer continuance of it.
