cumbered with woods, nor infected with marshes The
purity and sweetness also of the water, (which, perhaps, is
exceeded by none,) coming through rock or sand, and free of
metallic substances, must also contribute greatly to the
health of the inhabitants; and this blessing they usually en-

to be exhaled into the air.  Epidemical diseases are therefore
unknown here; except those which are of a common and
general nature.  Such as the small-pox, chin-cough, etc.
The small-pox, at times, carries off many of the children;
inoculation not having yet got much into practice.

ful green; but part of the soil being now washed off by the
storms, in the course of time, the rocks in some places begin
to appear.  They afford excellent pasture for sheep; of
