     Statistical Account

human body is liable to be affected with many diseases only
once in life, but it may be, and often is, repeatedly affected
with fevers.  The study of fevers, therefore, engaged Dr
Gordon's particular attention, and the numerous cases which
every day occurred, afforded ample scope for observation.
   He was mortified to find, that the method of treatment
commonly practised, and recommended by the most cele-
brated modern professors, so frequently failed of success;
and that many more recovered, when left to the efforts of
unassisted nature, than when treated according to the most
approved rules of art.  He was therefore naturally led to
entertain suspicions with respect to the propriety of those
rules; and was soon convinced by observation and expe-
rience, that it was impossible for him to be successful in the
treatment of fevers, without imitating the method by which
nature cured them.  For which purpose he made it his bu-
siness to pay particular attention to nature's operations and
method of cure, in order that he might make that method
the model of his practice.  And his practice, when thus re-
gulated, was attended with great success, and enabled him
to make some very important discoveries with regard to
the nature and treatment of fevers.  These discoveries he
proposes to lay before the public, as soon as he has fulfilled
his engagement to his pupils, who have urged him to pu-
blish a text-book, which he is preparing, and will soon have
finished.
   The method which was found so efficacious in the cure
of fevers, was applied to many other acute diseases upon the
same principles, and with similar success, as may be seen
from a perusal of the tables already referred to.  This shall
also be laid before the public as speedily as possible.

   At present, it shall only be observed, that the general prin-
ciple which pervades and guides the whole of his practice
is to imitate and follow the footsteps of nature, to make art
