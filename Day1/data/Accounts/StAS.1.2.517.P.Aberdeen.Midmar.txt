   Hills, Fossils, Mineral Springs, Etc.-In Mid-marr, the
only eminence, that deserves mention, is the hill of Fare,
which forms its southern boundary.  The base of this moun-
tain is about 17 miles in circumference; and its height 1793
feet above the level of the sea.  On that side, which is con-
tiguous to the castle of Mid-Marr, there is a thriving plantation
of fir trees, of almost every species.  The interior part con-
tains, in its moss, an invaluable article of fuel to the neigh-
bouring inhabitants.  It affords also excellent pasture, for
numerous flocks of sheep; and produces mutton of a very
superior flavour.  No place, in this part of the country, so
near the coast, abounds perhaps so much, in muir-fowl,
hares, and other game, which find, at the same time, both
food and shelter, in the luxuriant heath, which overspreads its
