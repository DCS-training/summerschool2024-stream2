great distance; and the roads, till of late turnpikes were
made, a great part of the year almost impassable; and no
pert in the parish, it seems probable, that turf, which is
here, in general, remarkably good, was the fuel chiefly used
in former times But now that coals are attainable, though,
owing to the great distance they are brought, and to toll-
bars on the road, very expensive; even the poorest people
in the parish, use a few of them.

   Church.-The antiquity of the church, we are as yet un-
able to trace; but, from its figure and construction, it seems
to have been built in those times, when the constitution of
men was greatly more strong than it is at present; for, ac-
cording to the custom of our hardy forefathers, it is partly
below ground, and the windows, or rather slits, are not made
to open and shut, by which the air is unavoidably affected,
and rendered somewhat like that in a family vault or damp
cellar.  The whole fabric is much decayed, and has been, for
a considerable time, in a ruinous state.
   Notwithstanding our other improvements, we are extreme-
ly sorry we have to regret the bad state of many of our parish
churches, and that thereby so little encouragement is given
to the people to attend public worship there, where it is ob-
viously the interest, as well as the bounden duty of the teach-
er to instruct them to fear God, to honour the King, to obey
the good Laws, to respect and revere the happy Constitu-
tion of their country, and to pray that thereby liberty and
peace may not only be enjoyed by them in their days, but al-
so conveyed full and entire to their children, and, by the same
happy and liberal means, transmitted unimpaired to the latest
posterity.  We are the more particular on this head, for the
information of stranger^, many of whom, we understand,
