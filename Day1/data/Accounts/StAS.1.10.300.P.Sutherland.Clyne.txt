twixt 2000 and 3000 spinners.  The yarn is sent south to be
manufactured.  Salt pans were set agoing at Brora, and great
quantities made and exported by a company from Portsoy, in
the time of the late Earl of Sutherland.  This work was dis-
continued about 16 years ago on account of the duty on the
coal, the seam found in the parish being of a sulphureous qua-
lity.  It is to be wished that it were renewed with greater vi-
gour.

   Soil, Produce, etc.-It is to be regretted that we are far be-
hind our neighbours in Rossshire in the article of rearing
lint, though our soil and climate seem to be very well adapt-
ed to its cultivation.  The inhabitants upon the coast are
chiefly farmers; they sow principally bear, and, for alternate
crops, oats and pease.  About the year 1756, planting of po-
tatoes was introduced, and is still practised throughout the
whole parish with great advantage.  Every farmer has gene-
rally one half of his possession under bear, and plants pota-
toes in that half which was formerly allotted for pease and
oats.  The bear land on the coast side is generally manured
with sea weed or ware.  There is hardly any such thing as
leaving any spot of land or ground, capable of culture, ley, or
in any way of summer fallow.  In short very little progress
in improvement has been made; partly owing to the preju-
dices of the people for old customs, and partly to the reluc-
tance that the managers of the affairs of the Sutherland fa-
mily have always shown to granting of leases.  The average
Produce from bear, on the coast, is 6 returns; of oats and
pease betwixt 4 and 5.  In the Highland parts little is sown, and
that only in choice spots laboriously manured and thinly sown,
by which means the returns are frequently 10 or 12 seeds.
What may appear astonishing is, that, in many spots, uninter-
mitted crops of bear are taken without rest or change in the
