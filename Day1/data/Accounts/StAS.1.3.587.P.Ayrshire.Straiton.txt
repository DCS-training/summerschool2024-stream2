   Situation and Extent.-The parish of Straiton lies in that
district of Ayrshire called Carrick, in the Presbytery of Ayr,
and synod of Glasgow  and Ayr.  It is about 15 miles in
breadth; containing about 75 square miles in surface.  The
situation of the village, at the bottom of 2 hills, between
which runs the water of Girvan, is delightful.  It is built
on a rising ground.  The houses are neat and uniform, being
all constructed upon the same plan, about 30 years ago, by

with excellent trouts.  There is one farm, containing up-
wards of 6000 acres, which does not pay to the proprietor a-
bove 50 l. of yearly rent.  A great deal, even of the arable
part of the parish, is employed in raising cattle.  The farmer
reaps a greater, at least a more certain profit, this way, than
from village.  The land employed in rasing corn, bears a
