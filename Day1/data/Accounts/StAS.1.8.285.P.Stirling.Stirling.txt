   Banks.-There are three banks in Stirling.  The Bank of
Stirling; that of Campbell and Thomson; and that of Belch
and Company; besides a branch of the Old Bank of Scotland.
The last, and two first, do business to a considerable extent.

   Fishery.-The salmon fishery belonging to the town, which,

the same source, makes the yearly income of Allan's Hospital
also 100 L. more than it really is.  At present, there are 44 pen-

2 d.  The annual expenditure, for the support of the poor on
this foundation, is about 172 L. Sterling.  The managers of
