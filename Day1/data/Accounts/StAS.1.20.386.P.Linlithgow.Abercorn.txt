this very circumstance, it is hardly possible to give any ge-
neral character.  The bottom, consisting of rotten whin,
lime-stone, free-stone, till, gravel, and sometimes of sand, is
as much diversified as the soil which covers it.  Notwith-
standing these circumstances, which wear an unfavourable
aspect to the intelligent farmer, there is no reason to com-
plain of want of fertility in those lands which have been
properly cultivated.

   Farming.-There is at present but a small proportion of
the parish employed in raising grain.  Exclusive of the pro-
prietors, who have generally some fields in tillage for their
conveniency, there are only about a dozen of farmers, who
may employ about 20 ploughs, each drawn by two horses.
There must have been formerly about five times the num-
ber of farmers.  The traces of many of the old farm-houses
can still be discerned, and there were others of which no
vestige remains.  There is only one corn-mill at present;
and one on a very small scale would be sufficient for the
business which the parish affords.  Formerly, however,
there were four, the ruins of which are still visible.  It is
probable there was never employment for that number.
When corn-mills were new, every body erected them; but
the number gradually diminished to what experience shew-
ed to be necessary.  Farming appears to have met with
considerable attention in this parish at an early period.  It
is not a great many years since wheat was cultivated even
in the more fertile districts of Scotland.  It must, however,
have been a staple article with the farmers here nearly two
hundred years ago; for a considerable part of the rents were
paid in wheat in the beginning of the 17th century, as ap-
pears from decreets of valuation obtained by different heri-
tors about the year 1630.  It would be unnecessary to give
any particular delineation of the system of farming which is
