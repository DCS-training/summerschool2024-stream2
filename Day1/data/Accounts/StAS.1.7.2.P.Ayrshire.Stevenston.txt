a ruin), belonged, according to traditions to the abbot.
After the Reformations the then Earl of Glencairn, who be-
came proprietor of the whole parish, lived in it.  The con-
cave roof of the old hall in that castle, a very spacious square
room, was ornamented with the coats of arms of the greatest
part of the Scottish nobility.  In the year 1678, the parish
was very inconsiderable, if we may judge from the proportion of
assessment it paid towards the maintenance of the Highland
Host, and other exactions, during those unhappy times.  It
must then have consisted of farmers only, who do not make
a tenth part of the inhabitants at present.  The two popu-
lous towns of Saltcoats and Stevenston, have risen almost within
the present century.  There was, indeed, about a quarter of
a mile east from the latter, a group of 14 or 16 houses,
chiefly inhabited by persons who manufactured, or played
on the trump, or Jew's harp, the ruins of which lately re-
mained; and one of the coal-pits contiguous to their ancient
dwellings, is still called the Pilber-heugh.  This parish lies
on the northern shore of the Bay of Ayr; its form is a kind
of irregular square, two miles and a half in length, and about
as much in breadth; but beyond this, the sandy ground
stretches two miles farther to the south-east, and terminates
on a point of land opposite to Irvine Harbour.  The two
rivers Garnock and Irvine, meet near this place, and
their waters immediately enter the Atlantic.  The line
of shore between the Harbours of Irvine and Saltcoats
is about five miles, and thus is nearly double the length of
the northern boundary.  The town of Stevenston is centri-
cal, with respect to the inhabited part of the parish.  The
church stands on an elevated ridge, immediately above the
town, and commands a very extensive and delightful prospect
of the whole bay of Ayr, narrowed by a long stretch of the
mountainous coast of Carrick towards the S. E. distant about
