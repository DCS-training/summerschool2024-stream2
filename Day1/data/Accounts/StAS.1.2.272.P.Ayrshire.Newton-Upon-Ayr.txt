     Statistical Account

   Though these lights were only erected in October, 1790,
they have already been found very beneficial.  The greatest at-
tention has been paid to them, so that no accidents have hap-
pened through neglect.
   The principal trade carried on at present, in the harbour, is
the exporation of coal.  For four years pass, above 300 ves-
sels have been annually loaded with coal, which go to Dublin,
Belfast, Learne, and other places in Ireland.  A few vessels
are also employed in bringing fir in logs, and plank, from Me-
mel, and other parts in the East seas.-Since the annexation of
the Isle of Man to the Crown, and particularly since the late
acts of parliament concerning smuggling, any species of illi-
cit trade is now little practised in this, or in any other part of the
neighbourhood.-There are two packet boats to Greenock,
one to Liverpool, and sometimes one goes to Campbleton.
No regular stated communication has hitherto been formed be-
tween this port and London.

   Ship building and Ropework.-For many years past, ship building
has been carried on at this harbour,-but it is only of late, that
this branch has met with any particular encouragement.  By
the activity and diligence of some individuals in the parish,
a number of vessels have been costructed, and the business
seems to proceed with spirit and vigour.  It is carried on chief-
ly on this side of the river, as affording many more convenien-
ces than the other.  Fifty hands are employed in this brach of
business, whose wages are from 20 d to 22 d per day.-Oak
wood is brought from England and Wales, fir from Dantzick:
