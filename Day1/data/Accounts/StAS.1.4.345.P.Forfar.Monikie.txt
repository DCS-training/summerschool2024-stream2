     of Monikie.

of the parish, there are large tracks of moor, formerly
waste and uncultivated, covered wholly with heath, info-
much that a person might have travelled a considerable
way without seeing any other vegetable.  At present
those tracks contain plantations of thriving young wood.
In a track of moor which forms the northern extremity of
this parish, there are settled 15 or 16 families, who, by
their industry, have rendered arable, and in some degree
fertile, considerable spots of land formerly waste and bar-
ren.  The valued rent of the parish is L. 4608:6:8
Scotch.  There are about 23 considerable farms, some of
which consist of more than 200 acres.

   Population.-This parish contains 2 large villages, one
of which having about 30, and the other 25 families, and
2 or 3 villages less populous.  According to Dr Webster's
returns, the numbers were 1345.  The number in 1772
was 1033; at present it is 1278.  There is reason to be-
lieve, that about the beginning and middle of this century,
the parish was more populous.  The diminution of the
number of people is owing to the union of farms; the
farmers also employ sewer hands than formerly.  Many of
the cottagers are exterminated.  Since commerce began to
flourish, several manufacturers, who subsisted partly by a-
griculture, have gone to large towns.  The annual average
of births for the last 10 years is 32.  The annual average
during a period of 10 years subsequent to 1718, and du-
ring 10 years subsequent to 1742, appears from a well
kept register, to have been 41.  For some years past, the
annual average of deaths has been about 19.  The number
of marriages annually for 7 years past has not exceeded
'13.
