     of Udny.

of Tarves; on the W. by Bourtie; on the S. W. by
Kiethhall; on the S. by Newmacher; on the S. E. by
Belhelvie; on the E. by Foveran; on the N. E. by Logie 
Buchan and Ellon.  The general appearance of the coun-
try is pretty flat, with small eminences or little hills, co-
vered with short grass.  The soil is in general a deep loam, 
with a considerable proportion of wet ground, partly on a 
clay bottom.  There are small streams of water in the val-
leys, from which the lands rise gently on each side, and 
are tolerably fertile.  The air is healthy.  Agues are scarcely 
known.  There are quarries of granite for building, and 
abundance of stones in the fields.  At Pitmedden there is 
a limestone quarry, which was formerly wrought, but now
discontinued, on account of water breaking in upon it. 
Upon the Mains of Udny, is another.  The lime is sold at 
1 s. 4 1/2 d. the boll slaked lime, consisting of 4 sirlots, 32 
Stirling pints in each.  The demand for this lime, will be 
principally from the district of Garioch, where they have
no lime-quarries.  The English shell-lime fold at New-
burgh at 2 s. 8 d. the boll, yielding 3 bolls flacked, is found 
by the farmers here to be much cheaper. 

   Population.-The numbers of the people, according to
Dr Webster, were 1322.  The amount of the present po-
pulation, in January 1791, is 1137 souls; of whom, 571
males, 566 females.
