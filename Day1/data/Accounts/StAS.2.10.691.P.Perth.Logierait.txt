   Robert Bissett, LL.D., author of a Life of Edmund Burke, And
of some other publications, was the son of the Rev.  Dr Bissett,
minister of this parish.
   Dr William Dick, of Tullymet, was, during many years, a phy-
sician of great eminence in the East India establishment. It ap-
pears by the following notice of this excellent individual, that he
on one occasion laid his country under obligations of no ordinary
nature. In a letter to Mrs M'Lean Clephane, Sir Walter Scott
writes, (in 1819, when his life was in danger,) " My health, how-
ever, seems in a fair way of being perfectly restored." (After
noticing his regimen,) "Dr Dick of the East India Company's
Service has put me on the course of cure, and says he never knew
it fail, unless when the liver was irreparably injured." (Lockhart's
Life of Sir Walter Scott, Vol. iv. p. 280.) Sir Walter considered
Dr Dick as the preserver of his life; and has recorded his sense
of obligation on a valuable silver inkstand, suitably inscribed, tiow
in possession of the family.

gusson, ordained minister of Crathie and Braemar in 1702, and
