   The districts of the parish most favourable for the researches
of the botanist are, the Braes of Gight, the Den of Rothie, and
the old wood near Fyvie Castle.  The most extensive plantation
in the parish is that of the Den of Rothie, belonging to Mr Gor-
don of Fyvie.  It runs west from the hollow of Fyvie, a distance
of about two miles and a half.  It consists chiefly of fir, and pro-
duces considerable revenue.  In the parish altogether it has been
calculated that there are 1735 acres in wood.  A great part of
this was planted by the late General Gordon of Fyvie, and his
example has been followed by the present proprietor.  A good
deal has also been done in this way by the present Mr Leslie of
Rothie, and by the former proprietor of Littlefolla; but still there
are considerable tracts of hill land, which in their present state
are bad objects in the landscape, and are lost in a great measure
as a source of revenue to the proprietors.  It is much to be desir-
ed that these were clothed with wood.  Therle is every encourage-
ment to this from the thriving state of all the plantations within
the parish, and the higher value to which wood must soon at-
tain, in consequenee of the rapid consumption of moss throughout
the country and the distance of this locality from the coast.
