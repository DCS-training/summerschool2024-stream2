  Before concluding this part of the statistics of Greenock, it may
be mentioned that, in 1714, it became a custom-house port as a
branch of Port-Glasgow. More recently it has been in direct
communication with the Board in London. The business of the
customes, originally transacted in apartments at the west or old
quay, is now carried on in a spacious building, one of the greatest
ornaments of the town, erected, at the public expense, on what is
called the Custom-House Quay, and occupied for the first time in
May 1818.
