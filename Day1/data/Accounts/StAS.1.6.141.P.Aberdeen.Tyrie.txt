bably in a few years, under the auspices of its patriotic and
benevolent landlord, rival the most flourishing villages in
Buchan.  Above L. 1000 sterling has been expended upon a
bleachfield, which is furnished with excellent machinery, and
every necessary convenience.  From 13,902 to 15,733 yards
of cloth, and from 514 to 564 spindles of yarn, have been an-
nually bleached here.  The tacksman pays L. 30 per ann. for
that field, is capable and attentive, but has no capital.  A
bleaching company, with a competent capital, might do great
things.  As new Pitsligo is about 5 miles from the parochial
school, a schoolmaster is stationed there, with a salary of L. 6
from the Society for propagating Christian knowledge, and
L. 6 from Sir William Forbes.  The weavers settled in this
village acknowledge, that they can afford to weave a halfpen-
ny per yard at least, cheaper than the weavers in any of the
towns.

   Produce, Exports, Rent.-The parish can supply itself with
meal, malt, butter, cheese, beef, mutton, lamb, poultry, po-
tatoes, and other common vegetables.-The principal ex-
ports are meal, cattle, sheep, hogs, butter, cheese, wool, po-
tatoes, and fuel.-The land-rent, according to the
most exact rental that can be obtained, amounts to L. 870
sterling.  Were the people encouraged to improve the uncul-
tivated grounds, the rent to the proprietors might arise to a
much greater amount.  But the tenants must first be put in
easy circumstances, and have longer leases, before they can
afford an adequate value for the lands they occupy*.
