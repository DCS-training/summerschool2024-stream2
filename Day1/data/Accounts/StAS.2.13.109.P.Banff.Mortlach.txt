      the Duchess of Gordon.  The parochial schoolmaster has the maxi-
      mum salary and the legal accommodations.  All persons in the pa-
      rish, of proper age, can read, and almost all write a little.
        Libraries.-There is a small circulating library in the parish,
      and also a small library for the use of the children who attend the
      Sabbath school.
        Poor and Parochial Funds.- The number of paupers at present
      on the roll may be about 60, and these are wholly supported by
      collections made in the church, which may average from 11s. to
      12s. weekly, and the interest of 1500 merks bequeathed by Wil-
      liam Duff, and L. 100 by Mr Alexander Forbes, a native of this
      parish.  The interest of this last sum can only, in terms of Mr
      Forbes's will, be given to four families annually.  Besides the
      above 1500 merks bequeathed by Mr Duff for behoof of the poor,
      he also bequeathed 500 merks for beboof of the schoolmaster.  Dr
      John Lorimer, formerly of this parish, left L. 200 for the mainte-
      nance of a bursar at the school of Mortlach, and L. 200 more to
      enable him, if so inclined, to prosecute his studies at Marischal
      College, Aberdeen.  It may be proper to observe, that the state-
      ment given in the former Statistical Account of this parisb of a
      sum of money having been bequeathed by a gentleman of the name
      of Moir, for the maintenance of a bursar from this parish, was in-
      correct.
