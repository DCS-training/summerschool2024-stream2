pily unknown; very few have fallen a sacrifice to the small
pox, though the people are in general averse to inoculation,
from the general gloominess of their faith, which teaches them,

of the Divine interposition, for the punishment of sin; any
interference, therefore, on their part, they deem an usurpa-
tion of the prerogative of the Almighty.

mounting to L. 7255, 7 s. Scots, is divided among six heri-

south part of the parish, situated in a hollow betwixt two
hills, sheltered on the east, west, and south sides, by planta-
