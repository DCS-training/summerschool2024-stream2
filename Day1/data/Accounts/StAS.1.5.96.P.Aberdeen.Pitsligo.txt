     PARISH OF PITSLIGO.

     (COUNTY OF ABERDEEN.)

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES GREIG, Minister of that Parish.

     Situation, and Extent.

   THIS parish belongs to the presbytery of Deer, and Sy-
nod of Aberdeen*.  It lies along the Murray Frith,
in a rectangular form, its eastern extremity being two miles 
west from Kinnaird's head, a conspicuous point in Aber-
deenshire, where a light-house was lately erected by go-
vernment.  It extends 3 miles and a half in leght well-
ward, and is 3 miles broad in every part, from the sea-coast
to the south.  A public road, leading from Fraserburgh west-
ward to Banss, intersects it nearly in the middle, from which
there is a gentle declivity on each side, to the south and
north.

   Soil, Climate, etc.-Tha face of the country is, in general,
level, there being no hill in the parish; neither is there any
river or lake in it, nor so much as a considerable stream.

<FOOTNOTE>

*It is the last erected parish that presbytery.  The lands of Pit-
tendrum were formerly in the parish of Frasersburgh, and a few farms be-
longed to that of Tyrie, but the greatest part of it to Aberdour, from which
it was disjoined, upon an application from Lord Pitsligo, in 1634, about the
time when he obtained his patent of peerage.
