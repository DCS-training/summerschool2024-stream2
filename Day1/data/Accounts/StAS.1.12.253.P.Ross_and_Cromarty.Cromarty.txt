present proprietor, and accurate maps of both properties made
out.  From which it appears, that there are, in all, 6343 acres,
2 roods, 31 falls; of which 1639 acres, 2 roods, 35 falls, are
arable; 1832 acres, 1 rood, 7 falls, in plantation; 2871 acres,

completes the richness of the scene, and constitutes, upon the
whole, the most beautiful variety of land and water that is to
be met with in Britain.  Travellers of the first rank and
taste have traversed the hill, and spoke of its beauties, with
