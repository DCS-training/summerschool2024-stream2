this part of the country.  This seam, so far as it could be
drained by the present water engine, is now exhausted.
The seams now working are of an inferior quality, but an

   Manufacture.-The chief  manufacture in the parish is
that a brown linen, from 8 d. to 10 d. a yard.  A consdiderable
quantity is whitened, and sold at from 10 d. to 20 d. and some
of a finer texture from 2 s. to 4 s. a yard.  There are about
140 looms in the parish, mostly employed in that manufac-
ture.  In the near neighbourhood of Leven, there is an ex-
tensive bleachfield, which may employ about 16 or 18
hands.  The business is yearly increasing, as the people's
prejudices against public bleaching are daily wearing off.
There is also a considerable roperie established at Leven,
and a good number of shoemaker are constantly employed
in making shoes for public sale.

   Church.-The church, a neat and modern building, with
a spire, was erected about 16 years ago, in the immediate
neighbourhood of Leven, being more convenient for the 
greater part of the parish, than the old situation at Scoonie,
which is about half a mile distant.  The manse has been in-
habited above 15 years, and is situated within an hundred
yards of the church.  The right of patronage, which belonged
formerly to the priory of St Andrew's, is vested in the
Crown.  The stipend consists of 54 1/2 bolls of bear, 44
bolls meal, 29 1/2  oats, and 4 bolls wheat, with L. 25 Sterling,
