have great pleasure in being enabled to remark, that over the
length and breadth of this large and populous parish, education
and knowledge have spread themselves among all ranks and clas-
ses. The people as a body have long been distinguished for their
quietness and general good conduct; and may justly be said to be
an industrious, contented, decent, and church-going population.

  Mines.-There are four coal-pits in this parish, one ironstone
pit, and one ochre pit. The Wemyss coal-pit employs 140
men, 24 boys, and 42 girls. The yearly produce is about 40,000
tons. The selling price of the splint is 8s. 6d. per ton. This pit is
sunk upon the main seam, which is 9 feet thick, and has been
wrought to the depth of 100 yards below sea level, through the
whole length of the parish, and has been working constantly for
the last two centuries. The next working is the parrot or gas
coal, which is wrought level free, no machinery being necessary.
It employs about 20 men, and is sold for 1Os. per ton. The
other two pits are wrought exclusively for land sale; they employ
about 50 men, 20 boys, and 7 girls. The ironstone working em-
ploys about 35 men and 3 girls. The ochre pit is but newly
commenced. The whole number of people employed in mining
and mining operations may amount to 300 men, (170 of whom
are colliers,) 44 boys, and 52 girls. Their operations, however,
require the employment of many other hands, such as smiths,
wrights, masons, &c. They all receive their wages every two
weeks, the payment of which is upwards of L. 400.
  There are several very powerful engines employed in this very
extensive coal establishment. And it is but jurtice to add, that
