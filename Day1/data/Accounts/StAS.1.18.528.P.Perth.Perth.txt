fides what they give in private to distressed persons or families,
they often make large voluntary contributions.
   The permanent funds for the maintainance of the poor,
are what is given by the Guildrey; by the several incorpora-
tions; by the friendly societies, which are now on a surer
footing than formerly; by the hospital, the yearly revenue of
which, is about L. 320, by the Established Kirk Session, the
yearly funds of which, chiefly arising from what is collected
at the doors of the churches, amount to about L. 300.
   The different kinds of the dissenters, especially the inde-
pendants, do much for their own poor.  And the Magistrates
yearly assess the inhabitants to the amount of about L. 300;
which, however, is not sufficient to maintain the begging
poor, as many of them are still to be seen in the streets, and
at the doors of houses.
   Provost Alexander Simpson, in the year 1778, mortified
L. 100 to the 2 Established Ministers and their assistant, on
condition that the yearly interest of it should by them be dis-
tributed to poor persons.  And in the year 1780, Mrs Smythe
of London, mortified L. 100 to the two Established Minis-
ters, for charitable purposes, the yearly interest of which
they distribute to the poor.

     SS15. Civil History.

   It is not my intention in this Statistical Account, to enter
into the particulars of the civil history of Perth, I refer to all
the histories of Scotland which have been published, in which
many occurrences relating to Perth, are taken notice of.  It
was long reckoned the capital city of Scotland, and now holds
priority next to Edinburgh.  In several of the public writs,
especially in the time of King James VI. it is called the city
of Perth, and still bears the title.
