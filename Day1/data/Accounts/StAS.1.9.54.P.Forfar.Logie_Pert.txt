strong work.  This is now commonly called the Old Bridge,
with a reference to the new one, which some years ago
was built across the North Water, near the mouth of it, on
the great coast road.  The old North Water Bridge was
built by John Erskine of Dun, superintendant of Angus
and Mearns, upwards of 200 years ago.  Concerning the
builder of this North Water Bridge, popular tradition says,
"That having had a dream or vision, that unless he should
build a bridge over Stormy Grain, where 3 waters run in
one, he would be miserable after death.  Accordingly go-
ing out one day in a pensive mood, and walking along the
banks of the North Elk he met an old woman near the
spot where the bridge now stands, and asking the name of
the place, received for answer, that it was called Stor-
my Grain, where 3 waters run in one.  Hence, recog-
nising this to be the spot to which his dream alluded, he
immediately set about building a bridge there; but the
bridge being founded, and the work going on, a speat in
the river swept it away, upon which he ordered the bridge
to be begun anew.  But after it was considerably advanced,
it tumbled down a second time.  Mr Erskine was now so
much discouraged, that he fell into a deep melancholy,
and kept his bed.  One day, however, observing a spider
attempting to weave a web, he saw it fall down; making
a second attempt, it was equally unsuccessful; but trying a
third time, it succeeded.  Accordingly encouraged by this,
he caused it be begun a third time, and had the good for-
tune to succeed."  Whether there be any real ground for
this traditionary story or not, it is by no means abhorrent
from the cast of mind that characterised those times.
