memory of man.-The climate is wholesome.  The prevailing
diseases are, coughs, colds, and rheumatism Of late the
coughs have frequently terminated in consumptions, and
there are instances of dropsy.

   Fisheries, etc.-There is a tolerable harbour for boats and
small ships at the mouth of the river Brora, which seems
to have given rise to the Merchant Company before men-
tioned, who import goods from London and Aberdeen, and
export linen-yarn manufactured from imported lint, and kelp
made on the shores of this, and the neighbouring parishes of
Loth and Golspie, of which one of the partners has had a
tack for some time past.  Such of the inhabitants as are con-

summer, and are generally very successful.  It is to be re-

on a more extensive scale.  The sea, and even the very shores,
abound with excellent fish; so that our more industrious
neighbours, on the south side of the Frith, come to our
coast and fish during the summer season, to great advan-

bait their lines, and never return home until they have a
load of excellent fish.  In the midst of the river Brora, the
cruives for intercepting the fish, and the fishing on that river,
though its run is only 3 miles, is let to a company at 100 L.
Sterling.  The Highland part of this parish, in common with
the other Highlands of this country, is well provided in ex-
cellent peats for fuel, and the coast side is furnished with that
useful commodity in greater abundance than the neighbour-
ing parishes.
   There is a spot of dry ground near Brora which turns out
to little account at present, but would answer extremely well
for a fishing villages or for carrying on a manufacture.  There
are joiners, coopers, taylor, weavers, shoemakers, smiths,
