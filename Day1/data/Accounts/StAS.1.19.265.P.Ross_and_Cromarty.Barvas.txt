bitants are exposed to rain and cold, and their clothing
poor.  Flannel-shirts, which are in general worn by the
common people, may be a good antidote against it.  Fevers
and fluxes are not uncommon; and many infants die of a
complaint called the five nights sickness, from their dying
of it upon the fifth or sixth night; there are no instances
of any who have been seized with it that escaped, nor has
the nature of this uncommon disease been as yet fully com-
prehended by the most skilful upon this island.

   Rivers, Woods, etc.-There is not a single tree, or even
any brushwood, to be seen in the whole parish.  There are
several small lakes or lochs, and some rivulets, but no stream
that deserves the name of a river.  In these are various
kinds of trout, and in a few of them some salmon.  Upon
the minister's farm is a small water, where a few fine sal-
mon, though of a small size, are caught, from the month of
May till August.  There are a few cod, ling, and haddock,
taken upon the coast; but the principal fishing is that of
dog-fish, from the liver of which they extract a consider-
able quantity of oil.  Upon an average, there are about 8832
Scotch pints annually manufactured of it, and sold to the
Stornoway merchants at from 6 d. to 8 d. per pint.  Five
of the annual bounties or premiums given by the Trustees
for encouraging this trade, are generally gained by boats in
this parish.  The season for it is from the beginning of
May to the latter end of August, when the weather proves
favourable; indeed, it must be very moderate before they
can venture to sea, which makes them exceedingly cau-
tious when the wind blows off the land, left they be driven
to the northern ocean.  It is very astonishing how few ac-
cidents happen, considering the terrible seas they encoun-
ter, and the badness of the creeks where they land.  The
number of boats employed in this fishing is about 42, from
