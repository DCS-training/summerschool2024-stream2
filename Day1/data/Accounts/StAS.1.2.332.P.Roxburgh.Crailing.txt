     Statistical Account

ling is bound to furnish, a guard of his own vassals, for the cir-
cuit Court of Justiciary, when it meets at Jedburgh.  On this
account, there is annexed, to that barony, the property of
some acres of land at Lanton, in the parish of Jedburgh, which
is called the Crowner's lands.

   Disadvantages.-It is a disadvantage, to which the lowest
haughs of the parish are liable, that the rivers sometimes
swell to such a height, as to carry off either the corns when
cut, or the manure, when lying on the surface, and thus to
destroy the labours of the farmer.  What renders these floods
more destructive is, that they are often unexpected, and sud-
den, by great rains falling in the distant mountains, when no
symptoms are perceived by the inhabitants of this, and of the
neighbouring vallies.
   But the chief and general disadvantage of this parish, is,
the distance from coal, and the great expence of land carriage,
on that and all other commodities.  Although a considerable
quantity of fire-wood is annually fold at Crailing plantations,
yet it is generally thought, that coals are the cheapest fuel.
They are brought from Etal in Glendale, and from Rychester
on Reid water, a branch of the Tyne, both in Northumber-
land, and both distant about 23 miles.  But still it is some comfort
to observe, that these coals are of a very excellent quality.

   Means of Improvement-The improvements of this parish,
and of the neighbouring districts in general, have been very ra-
pid for some years, owing to the establishment of turbpike
roads, and to the great succeds in the culture of turnip; and
it is hoped, that there will soon be an easy communication
with the German ocean, by means of the proposed canal.  If
that should take place, it will necessarily lead to the establish-
ment of manufactures, and thereby increase the population, 
extend the improvements, and double the value of estates in 
this part of the kingdom.
