   Miscellaneous Observations.-Many dreadful accidents have
happened in this parish.  Several persons have been drown-
ed; several hurt and killed, and burnt to death, at the public
works.  Two children had their brains dashed out, by coal
waggons going over their heads.  Two young men belong-
ing to the parish had their lives wonderfully preserved, after
falling from heights, almost incredible to be told.  One fell
75 1/2 feet from a high tower, and was little hurt; the very
same person, sometime after, fell 30 feet from the roof of
a house, and was not hurt.  Another person fell into an
old coal-pit, 70 feet deep, and was got out safe, having
only his thigh bone broken.  These old open coal-pits,
without the least fence around them, are frequent in all
the collieries of this parish.  They are a publick nuisance,
by which the lives of men are often exposed to real dan-
ger.
   At the colliery of Sauchy, there is at present a woman
who has twins: she herself was a twin, and her mother
was one of three at a birth.  Two sisters in the parish were
lately the mothers of three dumb children.
   A young cow, some years ago, produced a calf when
she was exactly 13 months old.
   About 20 years ago, a very large spreading ash tree was
struck by lighting, and has since exhibited a singular
phenomenon.  The lighting had struck one half, only,
