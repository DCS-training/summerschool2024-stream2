		I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.-IN ecclesiastical records, this parish is generally design-
    ed St Boswell's, but elsewhere it is more usually named Lessud-
    den. In point of fact, the one is the name of the parish, the other
    of a village, which occasionally gives its name to the parish, as con-
    taining the great bulk of the population. The church is suppos-
    ed to derive its name from Boisel, a monk of Melrose, and subse-
    quently Prior of the monastery,-the pious master of the cele-
    brated St Cuthbert,-and, if not the founder, at least one of the
    earliest religious functionaries, of the parish. The saint lent his
    name to a village also, which seems to have been of considerable
    extent in its day, but of which now scarcely one stone remains on
    another.
	Extent, Boundaries.-This parish is of small dimensions, being
    3 miles in length by 1 1/2 in breadth, and forming an area of 4 1/2
    square miles, of an oblong figure: it is bounded on the north by the
    river Tweed; on the cast by the parish of Maxton; on the south by
    Ancrum; and on the west by Bowden and Melrose.
	Topographical Appearances.-Tbe surface in the upper por-
    tion of the parish is undulating, rising into ridges or small eni-
    nences, with hollows or flats intervening. The lower grounds,
    however, approaching the Tweed, are more free from inequali-
    ties. The banks of the river, with the exception of the north-
    east boundary, are bold, precipitous, and well-wooded. To the
    north of the village of Lessudden, there is an elevated ridge over-
    looking the Abbey of Dryburgh, embosomed in wood, and en-
    circled by the Tweed, where the prospect in every direction em-
    braces a variety of objects that can scarcely be rivalled in beauty
    and grandeur. Although this eminence is immediately adjoining
