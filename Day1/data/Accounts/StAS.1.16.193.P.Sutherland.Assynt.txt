the narrator came here, the crop was lost, also the peats al-
most.  In spring 1772, in consequence of the preceding
indifferent harvest, one-fourth part of the cattle perished.
In particular, the care was, That a great storm of snow
came on in the beginning of January; it continued off and
on till the beginning of April, when it was carried away
suddenly by a great and uncommon deluge of rain.  Frost
continued throughout April: In a word, though all the
provender, and even the corn was given, the cattle perish-
ed.  The 1782 was bad; but nothing so distressing as the
last mentioned.  This same 1793 has been distressing through-
out the whole of it; the crop is for the most part damaged,
and the best of it hurt.  In short, by observation, the narra-
tor can truly say, that every 9th or 10th year turns out di-
stressing, either by loss of crop, loss of cattle, perhaps both, if
the spring proves not favourable; and in the same proportion
of years presently mentioned, there is generally a failure of
credit by drovers in more or less degree; for, as they drive
all the cattle fold here, and other neighbouring northern
parishes, to the southern markets, they must necessarily feel
the effects of bad seasons and times; and such is the care
here at present.  The intermediate years betwixt every
9th or 10th year, are, upon the whole, not to be com-
plained of.

   Crop of the whole Parish, etc. and Number of Souls.-The
crop of the whole parish consists of oats, the small black
kind, of barley and potatoes.  When good years occur, the
produce of all these, on the heights of the parish, may suffice
for fix or seven months at most.  For the lower parts, and
along the whole coast, it will probably serve for ten
months; and in case of a good herring-fishing, and plenty
of them secured for family consumption, the year may pass
tolerably well in this quarter.  But in bad years, no less
