     Trinity Gask.

Graham of Balgowan; Thomas Hepburn, Esq.  Only two of
the heritors reside in the parish.

   Population.-This parish, according to the report made to
Dr Webster in 1755, contained 913 inhabitants.  The pre-
sent number is 795.  The decrease from 1755 to 1795, is
118.

   Church. Stipend.-This parish is situated in the county of
Perth, the presbytery of Auchterarder, and synod of Perth
and Stirling.  It consists of the united parishes of Kinkel and
Wester Galk; and, as report says, contained a third place of
worship, called Chapel-hill.  The union of the three, into
one parish, is said to have given rise to the present name of
Trinity Gask.  The kirk at Chapel-hill has long since fallen
into ruins.  From the rubbish large stones, some with crosses,
etc. cut upon them, have been occasionally dug up.  The
adjoining burying ground is converted into a cottage-garden,
in which human bones are sometimes found.  Divine worship
has till of late been performed in the church of Kinkel; where
in summer, the minister officiated every fourth sabbath.  The
building having fallen into disrepair, is now abandoned as a
place of worship; which was the more readily submitted to,
as the minister was not supposed to be under any obligation to
continue the former practice.  The church and manse at Tri-
nity Gask were rebuilt about 20 years ago, and are in good
repair.  Mr James Brough, the present incumbent, was or-
dained minister here in 1794.  The stipend consists of 36
bolls of oat-meal, 24 bolls of bear, and L. 48 ster. in money.
A process of augmentation is at present depending; and the
funds for obtaining it are very sufficient.  The glebe, con-
sisting of the old glebe of Welter Gask, united to a piece of
land, exchanged two years ago for the glebe at Kinkel,
