   Trees of many kinds have been extensively planted, and
thrive well, particularly beech, elm, oak, sycamore, lime, and
chestnut, Scots, silver, and spruce fir, and larch. The masses of
wood are penetrated and rendered accessible in every direction of
rides and green glades, whose windings and recesses afford many
exquisite glimpses of forest scenery. The plantations have been
chiefly formed during the early part of last century, and there are
but few traces of great age. The cedar trees (Cedrus Libani) in
th Hopetoun pleasure-grounds are well worthy of notice, from
their size and beauty. Planted only in 1748, the largest already
measures 15 feet 7 1/2 inches in girth, and 87 feet between the ex-
tremities of its branches. The increase of girth has been 5 feet
within the last thirty years. In the same grounds, a sweet chest-
nut tree (Fagus castanea) measures 13 feet 9 inches, and an aged
beech 14 feet 4 inches in circumference. The growth of the
silver firs (Abies picea,) planted early in the last century, is re-
markable, several being nearly 100 feet high. The tulip trees
(Liriodendron tulipifera) are of considerable size, and frequently
flower. The hemlock spruce (Abies Canadiensis) has been intro-
duced, and grows vigorously. To the east of the house, near a
quarry, a plane tree (Acer pseudo-platinus) of 4 1/2 feet in girth,
is more notable for the number of its spreading branches and the
ground it covers than for the thickness of its trunc, the distance
betwixt the extremities of its boughs being 116 feet. A range of
gigantic ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior,) of unknown age, marks the
ancient boundary of the parish churchyard. The largest measures
16 feet in girth. Their hoary trunks and shattered limbs are
monumental of generations long since passed away, whose dust
slumbers at their feet. In an arboretum attached to the gardens
at Hopetoun House are several Scots firs (Pinus sylvestris) of
great size and picturesque form, and groups of various exotic
trees; amongst others, the Cedrus deodara and the Abies mirinda
