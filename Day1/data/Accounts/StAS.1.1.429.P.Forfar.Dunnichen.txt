of their land was from 4 to 5 s. in acre, than now when they
pay three or four times that sum.

   Minerals.-Little search has been made for minerals in
this parish.  The most valuable is free or grit stone, it is
easily quarried, and is found in every part of the hill of Dun-
nichen, and other parts of the parish, and is very fit for build-
ing houses and stone-fences  A few strata of whin-stones
appear in some places, and a coarse iron-bar in the hill.  No 
symptom of coal has as yet discovered itself any where in this 
country.

   Air and Climate.  The air of this parish is supposed to be
remarkably healthy, from the many old people in it; and the
climate is nearly the same with that of all the eastern coast of 
the island.  In the spring, and beginning of summer, easterly
winds generally prevail after mid day, attended with chilli-
ness, and sometimes fogs, though in a less degree than nearer
the coast of the German Ocean.  The  heaviest rains come in
autumn and winter, from the south-east, attended by violent
winds, which last sometimes two or three days, and occur
twice or thrice in the year.

   Antiquities.-There are only a few antient tumuli or bar-
rows in the parish, which, when opened, are found to con-
tain human bones, in rough stone coffins.  Pots of a coarse
earthen ware are also sometimes found in then.  Neither
coms nor arms have as yet been discovered in or near them,
to assisst our conjectures as to their date.  In the moss of
Dunnichen have been found very large roots of oak trees,
and some horns of the red deer, and also a stratum of coarse
marl below the moss, and six feet under sand.
