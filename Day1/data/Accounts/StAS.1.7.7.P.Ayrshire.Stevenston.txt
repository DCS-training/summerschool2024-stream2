Of these there are very few on any part of the west coast.
There is a small salmon fishing at the mouth of the rivers
Garnock and Irvine, from whence they sometimes come
along the whole shore of the parish, and are caught near
Saltcoats Harbour.  The salmon seldom make their appear-

parishes of Kilwinning and Ardroffan.  No fishes are caught
in it, except a few perches and pikes.

for three fourths of the year, the air is in general salubrious,
and the climate more mild by several degrees, than in the
higher country; snow being seldom seen in the lower part
of the parish for 24 hours.  The climate is also more dry;
the loaded clouds often passing on till they touch the

are sometimes dreadful, among the children of the families
who neglect inoculation.  The measles and the chincough are
