   The example of this respectable lady, was afterwards fol-
lowed successively, by Mr Steel, Mr Farquhar of Gilmills-
crost, Mr Dunlop of Garnkirk, and others.  These improve-

cotton-mills and village of Catrine, which have infused new
life and activity into this part of the country.  These various
operations, he himself superintends with unwearied attention
and activity.  It is no more than justice to acknowledge,
too, that in every kind of public work, in which he has any
concern, such as the building of repairing of churches, man-
