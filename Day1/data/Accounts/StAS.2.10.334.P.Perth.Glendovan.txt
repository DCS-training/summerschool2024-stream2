   There has also been for some time past, at Burnfoot, in this pa-
rish, a mill, on a small scale, for spinning wool.  This year great ad-
ditions are being made to it.  The present erection is double the
width of the former, and two stories are in the course of being ad-
ded to it.  It is situated in the midst of a wool country, and I
hope the tenant will not be disappointed in his expectations.

                      V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Since my former Account a toll-road hag been made through
the Glen: It passes through the parish for three miles `nd a half.
It was executed at great expense:  the forming, metalling, cut-
ting earth and rock, building bridges, and conduits, damages, &c.
cost L. 5257, 16s. ; but the advantages obtained have been very
considerable.  The farmers who formerly took from 7 to 8 cwt. sel-
dom more, now take from 15 to 18 cwt.; and carters, who load
heavily, take from 20 to 25 and sometimes 30 cwt.  The villagers,
who are supplied from Blairengone and Dollar, burn their coal about
5d. per cwt. cheaper than before the road was made, estimating
summer and winter together; and a much greater quantity of lime
is now driven by the farmers.
   Ecclesiastical state.- There are four families in the parish who
attend,a Dissenting meeting at the Yetts of Muckart.  They are
descendants of those who separated from the church, when
Messrs Wilson, Erskine, Moncreiff, and Fisher left it, and erect-
ed themselves into a presbytery. All the rest belong to the Es-
tablished Church.  The stipend amounts to L. 150 Sterling.
   Education.- The parochial school is the only one in the parish.
Salary the maximum.  Amount of school-fees received, from
L. 25 to L. 30.
   Poor.-The average number of persons receiving parochial aid
is four; and the average sum allowed to each is 1s. per week.
The average amount of church collections for the poor is L. 7
per annum: and thdre is no assessment.
