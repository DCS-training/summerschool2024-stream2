they will cut glass like a diamond.  They grow on the rocks
that overhang the rivulet in large clusters, about the size of
pin heads, where they continue to vegetate (as may be collect-
ed from the different stages of their progress, evidently there
to be seen) till they are near an inch long and diameter;
when dropping out of their sockets, they fall into the water,
and mix with the gravel at the bottom of the rill.  The end
that sat in the socket, very much resembles that part of a
tooth which sticks in the jaw; the other end of most of them
is tapered; and (which is the great and inexplicable pheno-
menon), are cut into triangular, quadrangular, and various
other figures, as neatly and distinctly, as if they had come
through the hands of the best lapidary in the kingdom.  How

singular fruit, whether in 50, 100, or 1000 years, cannot be
so much as guessed at.

As there is at present no parish register, the average of births,
burials, etc. cannot, with any precision, be ascertained.  These
particulars, however, may be calculated with an accuracy
quite sufficient for any public or political purpose, from the
ample data already afforded from places where registers are
kept; taking into consideration this circumstance, that the
people here, in general, enjoy good health, and many of them
long life.  As a proof of this, there died, within these last
5 years, no less than 9 persons, who had all arrived at the ad-
vanced period of between 80 and 90.  And at this day there
