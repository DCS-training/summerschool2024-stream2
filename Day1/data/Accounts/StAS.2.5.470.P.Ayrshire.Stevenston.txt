L. 100, to which some handsome additional present is every year
added.
  All the places of worship in the parish are pretty well attended.
The Dissenters draw their congregations from more than one pa-
rish. When the last survey was made in 1836, the number of
Dissenters in this parish was as follows:

        United Secession, 227    Roman Catholics,    17     Methodist,   1

   Education.--There are five schools in the parish; one paro-
chial school; one supported by subscription; and three supported
by the wages. During the last six months, 163 have attended the
parochial school. At the examination in December 1836, 122
were present. Of the above numbers, all were learning English;
41 writing; 17 arithmetic; 8 English grammar; 6 Latin; 4 ma-
thematics.
The salary of the parochial teacher is the maximum,             L. 34   4   4 1/2

    The school-room is greatly too small, and in every respect bad,
and we would reprobate it in the strongest terms, were it not that
we believe the heritors are quite disposed to build one better suit-
ed to the parish.
   There is another good private school in Stevenston. During
the last six months 130 have attended it. The school fees are
the same as in the parochial school; and may amount, through-
out the year, to about L. 48. About thirty attend evening classes.
   The free school in Saltcoats is called the Ladies' School, be-
cause superintended and managed by a committee of ladies. It is
for both parishes. The usual number who attend is about 30.
They are all females, and are taught English, and knitting, and
sewing.
   In two other private schools there are only 23 more at school
in our side of the town, out of a population of 1466.  Matters,
however, are not just so bad as they look, for fully as many more
from this parish are attending schools in the Ardrossan side of
Saltcoats. Yet matters are far from being in so good a state as
we would wish; and we sball not rest satisfied till we have an en-
dowed school, placed in some convenient situation in our side of
the town of Saltcoats.
   We have two Sabbath evening schools in Stevenston, attended
