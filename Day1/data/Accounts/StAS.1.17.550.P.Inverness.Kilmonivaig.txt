however powerful.  Another tradition, which is that of the
natives, is, that they were made by the Fingalians; and, un-
der the name of Fingalian roads*, they are still known
in this country.  Of this the natives are convinced, from
this circumstance, that several of the hills of this glen
have retained, from time immemorial, the names of some
of the heroes of Fingal; such as, the hill of Gaul, the
son of Morni; that of Diarmid, and of Tillan; and like-
wife of Bran, the famous dog of Fingal, etc.  Now, the po-
pular belief cannot be considered as a direct proof of any
opinion, yet we cannot help remarking, that the original
tradition (which, in this case, has been always invariable)
gives a strong degree of credibility to the existence of such
heroes, and renders it by no means improbable that these
extraordinary roads have been the result of their labours.
The purpose which they were designed to serve, seems to
have been (agreeably to the common opinion) to facilitate
the exercise of hunting; for, in ancient times, and indeed
till within this century, the valley was covered with wood,
which made it very difficult to pursue the deer, etc. and ren-
dered certain avenues necessary for effecting this purpose;
in corroboration of which opinion, it may be observed, that
upon the sides of the roads, there have been found some
stakes fixed in the ground, probably the remains of the pa-
lings or fences, which in those days were made use of to con-
fine the game, till they were driven in upon a field, called
Dal-na-sealg, or hunting dale, where, the presumption is,
they were killed.

*They are likewise called the Casan, i. e. the roads, by way
of eminence.  They prove that Sir Alexander Murray of Stan-
hope's celebrated plan for parallel canals, even in mountainous
countries, is not impracticable.
