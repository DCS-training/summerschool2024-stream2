   Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-The church and manse are
both old buildings, and have received frequent partial re-
pairs.  The latter of these continues, notwithstanding, a
very damp and uncomfortable habitation.  The Crown is
patron.  The stipend consists of a little more than 4 chal-
ders of victual, wheat barley and meal, and L. 36:7:9
money, and a few bolls of coals.  The glebe is 4 acres
and about 16 falls or roods.  There is no grass; in lieu of
which, the heritors pay the minister L. 20 Scots; a very un-
equal compensation, at present, for the maintenance of a
horse and two cows.-There is no school or school house in
the parish.  The school, at present, is taught in a small
confined apartment, in a private house, and the schoolma-
ster has a single room for himself, in the same house; for
each of these, the heritors pay 15 s. yearly.  The salary is
only 100 merks.  The school-fees are small, and the other
emoluments few.  These unfavourable circumstances have
occasioned a rapid succession of teachers, within these last
20 years.  Every vacant school is an object to a person
who finds himself so inconveniently situated, and every
change of a master interrupts and retards the education of
youth.-There are no funds for the poor, except what arise
from the weekly collections, which, as no heritor resides,
are but small, and from the use of the mortcloths.  These
together afford but a scanty provision for the poor.  No as-
sessment is laid upon the heritors, who, on account of their
non-residence, contribute nothing to the funds.  They have
however, been indebted to the generosity of one of the he-
ritors, the proprietor of Potty, who has at different times

ence to some religious, establishment with which they were connected;
and it is not improbable they might be detached but dependent parts of
the abbey of Lindores; the ruins of which still remain in the vicinity of
the town of Newburgh, about 6 miles from this.
