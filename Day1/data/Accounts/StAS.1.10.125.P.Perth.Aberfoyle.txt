     of Aberfoyle.

   Next to the breeding of sheep, the most advantageous
mode of farming is the wintering of black cattle, for which
many farms in this parish are peculiarly adapted, by the shel-
ter which the woods afford against the inclemencies of the
weather.  When the snows cover the ground, the cattle are
fed with hay of the natural grass produced on the bogs, and
cut down in August.  The cattle are bought in at from 2 L.
10 s. to 3 L. 15 s. in November, and sold in May, to be fat-
tened for the butcher.  The average profit has, for some
years past, been from 18 s. to 20 s.
   Wool, too, is a considerable article of commerce; it is sold
from 5 s. to 9 s. or 10 s. per stone.  The farmer is also assist-
ed in making up his rent by the sale of butter and cheese.
   In enumerating the productions of Aberfoyle, its extensive
and valuable woods, consisting principally of oak, must not
be omitted.  The whole woods of this parish (including about
a 24th part on the outskirts of the neighbouring parish) are
divided into 24 lots or parcels, one of which is annually sold,
and cut down; so that, in 24 years, the whole woods are cut
down, and the same rotation again ready to commence.  By
the present regulation, the purchaser is obliged to leave for
standards, 400 trees of 24 years growth, 8 of 48 years, and
8 of 72 years.  From the distance of market, the timber
brings little price; it is generally supposed that it pays the ex-
pence of cutting, and stripping off the bark.  The bark itself
sells, at present, at 1 s. 6 d. per stone.  It is driven to water-
carriage at Stirling.

   Proprietor and Rent.-The property of this parish was an-
ciently vested in the Grahams, Earl of Monteith; but, on
the failure of heirs male of that family about the end of the
last century, their estate came to the family of Montrose.
The Duke of Montrose is now sole heritor in this parish,
