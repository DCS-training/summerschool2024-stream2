few influential gentlemen in this town, for the parishes of Ayr,
Newton, and that populous district of St Quivox, named Wallace-
town, which has now been erected into a separate parish by itself.
The same plan was adopted as that laid down by the Rev. Dr
Duncan, the original inventor, and the undertaking was brought
to a successful issue by the indefatigable exertions of Mr Cowan,
banker, then Provost of Ayr. A subscription was obtained of up-
wards of L. 400, of which only two and a half per cent. was col-
lected, to provide for expenses, and the remainder, which was never
called for, stood over as a fund for the security of the establish-
ment. The subscribers only were made eligible as directors, and
the depositors themselves have been excluded from all share in the
management. The bank is open once a week, viz. every Monday
morning, to receive any sums that may be offered from 1s. To
L. 10. When the deposits reach this last sum, the contributor is
obliged to withdraw his money and dispose of it elsewhere. The
number of open accounts is at present 700, and the sum due by
the bank is L. 3320. In 1822, there were only 358 open accounts,
and the sum annually deposited continued, with little variation, at
about L. 1100 per annum for twelve years, when, in 1828, there
was an increase to L. 1700 per annum of deposits, and of ninety
additional open accounts. Since that period, the deposits and ac-
counts stand as follows:

	The total number of accounts opened since the commencement of
this bank to this date is 3613, and the total amount of money paid in
small sums is, L. 30,017, 14s. 3d., which may be regarded as an ex-
cess of labour and of wages above what is required for the conveni-
ences and necessaries of life. It is impossible to estimate to their full
extent the great moral as well as temporal benefits that are calculat-
ed to accrue to the labouring classes from such an institution as
this, of which, as above, they appear to avail themselves so exten-
sively. A great proportion of the depositors consists of apprentices
and servant girl, who are thus inured to habits of economy, pru-
dence, and foresight, while they lay up in store besides, small
fund, which they will find of incalculable advantage for their future
