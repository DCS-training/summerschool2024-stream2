ther during spring, sea-mews visit this part of the. country. Jack-
daws and crows are abundant; and so are also many sorts of sing-
ing-birds, as the lark, the linnet, the blackbird, the thrush, the ro-
birds. The house-sparrow, the, the finch, the wagtail, and other small
birds, are common. In summer, the swallow, the land-rail, the
cuckoo, and other birds of passage, pay their annual visit. The
parish has also its full share of insects and reptiles; and some of
the dragon-flies are large and beautiful.

   Botany.-These plants are found on the hills:

polygaly vulgaris, milkwort                Pinguicula vulgaris, butterwort. This
Galium saxatile                               plant has some appearance of the P.
Gnaphelium dioicum, mountain cudweed          Lusitanica, which has not been fntnd
Gymnadenia conopses, fragrant gym.            on this side of the island.

Pyrola minor

   The three species of heath, natives of Britain, namely, Calluna
vulgaris, Erica tetralix, and E. cinerea, are found intermixed in
the hills and moors.  All the plants common in most parts of Scot-
land are also abundant here.  And were the banks of the streams,
the recesses of the woods, the moors, and the marshes, carefully
examined, there is no doubt but a rich botanical harvest would be
gathered.  All the common sorts of wood grow in the parish, as
the oak, the ash, the mountain-ash, the elm, the beech, the labur-
num, larch, spruce, Scotch fir, and other kinds of trees. The
large plantations consist chiefly of larch and Scotch fir. At Stan-
ley House, there are two very large and fine yew trees, and in the
lawn and along the banks of the Tay ` great number of beeches,
of a large size and beautiful shape. Within six yards of the east
corner of the manse is a weeping birch, which, by reason of its broad
flat top, and long pendant tendrils, excites the admiration of all
by whom it is behold.

   Violence of Farmer Times. -Myln, in his lives of the Bishops of
Dunkeld, tells us, that, while James Bruss hold that see between
1441 and 1447, his nephew, Andrew Forrester of Torwood, who
rented the lands of Little Dunkeld, had an encounter with Robert
Reoch Makdonoquhy to the east of the Church of Auchtergaven,
where he was so severely wounded in the head that he died in con-
