unusual among peasants.  While engaged in tending their
sheep they have long intervals of leisure.  Many of them fill
up these with reading and reflection.  Hence they are always
better informed than the mechanics, or even the labourers
who are engaged in agriculture.
   Many of the farmers are decent and intelligent men.  They
are mostly wealthy, and live in a very comfortable stile.
Some of them pay a great deal of rent.  One, in particular,
pays 500 L. Sterling per annum, and has a stock of near 6000
sheep.

   Antiquities.-There were formerly several tumuli on the
banks of the Cree.  In the year 1754, some of these were
opened, and arms found in them, particularly three pieces of
armour, all of which seem to have been offensive.  One of
them was formed very much like a halbert.  The second
was shaped on one side like a hatchet; but, subjoined to the
back part of this hatchet, there was an instrument resembling
a pavier's hammer.  The third was like a spade, but much
smaller in size.  Each of these had a proper aperture for re-
ceiving a handle.  When they were first discovered, they
were so much covered with rust, with which they seemed to
be much corroded, that it was impossible to distinguish of
what metal they were made; but they were at last found to
be of brass.  They lay for many years in a farm-house in the
parish; but it is not now known what is become of them.
Near the place where these were found, some vestiges of an
intrenchment are still to be discovered; and formerly, at no
great distance from this, some large stones were placed, in-
closing a circular piece of ground.  These circumstances tend
strongly to confirm the truth of an account which Buchanan,
in his History of Scotland, gives of a battle which was fought
near the Cree, by the Scots on one side, and the Romans
and Picts on the other.
