may be estimated at L. 4000 sterling.  The rents are generally
paid partly in money and partly in victual.  Most of the
landlords require also kain of fowls, certain carriages of vic-
tual or coal; and those who reside in the parish, a certain
number of days labour in the moss when casting peats; all
which it would be better to abolish, and take the value in
grain or money at a reasonable conversion.  Thirlage is ge-
nerally abolished; in some instances however it still remains.
This institution marks a remote period of society, and the re-
mains of it greatly retard improvement.

   Land and Produce.-The quantity of land in this parish
cannot easily be ascertained.  According to the most probable
conjecture, the carse may be supposed to contain 1200 acres
of arable land, and about 300 of moss; the dryfield about
5000 acres of arable and pasture land, and about 1500 or
2000 of moor.  Land in the carse is worth from 15 s to 20 s;
in the dryfield, from 5 s to 25 s per acre.  Oats, and barley
or bear, form the staple produce of this parish.  Oatmeal in
considerable quantities is exported to the west highlands, the
printfields on the water of Leven, the Dunbarton, and the
Glasgow markets.  The barley is purchased by the distiller
and the malt men in the parish by the latter, malt in consi-
derable quantities is exported to the highlands.  Much more
barley than grows in the parish, perhaps double the quantity,
is purchased by them.  Some wheat is sown in the carses,
very little in the dryfield; the wetness and lateness of our
climate is peculiarly unfavourable to the cultivation of this
kind of grain.  Pease are sown in the dryfield, and beans in
the carse.  Most farmers raise as much flax as supplies their
own families with that useful article, but none for the mar-
ket.  The same thing may be affirmed with respect to pota-
toes.  Very few turnips are fown.-In the carse, a kind of
