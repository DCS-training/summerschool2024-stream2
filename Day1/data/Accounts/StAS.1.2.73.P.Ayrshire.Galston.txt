   Air, Climate, Hills, etc.-The air may be called rather
moist, but it is not unhealthy.-In common with all the
western coast of Scotland, there are frequent rains, and high
winds; the latter of which are supposed to contribute much
to the general health of the inhabitants.  Sometimes, even in
summer, and autumn, the rain falls in considerable quantities,
and in large drops.-The most remarkable hills are Cairn-
saigh, which, in the Celtic, signifies, The Hill of Peace; where
probably, in former times, some truce or other agreement
was made between two neighbouring clans, regarding their
boundaries; and thus the large dykes, and cairns of stones,
on the top of Cairnfaigh may be accounted for.  Mol-mount
(Mollis Mons) is arable to the top.  The view from this hill
is delightful; a great part of Carrick, most of Kyle, and all
Cunningham being seen from it.  In the neighbourhood, there
is under view, the antient feast of Cessnock Tower and Loudoun
Castle, with their extensive woods and plantations, the thriving
village of Galston, the turnings and windings of the Irvine,
etc.; and, with regard to distant objects, in fine weather, the
island of Arran, (which serves as a barometer to this country),
and even Ireland itself, may be clearly distinguished.

   Antiquities.-There are the remains of a druidical temple on
the top of Mol-mount-hill, of a circular form, and of about sixty
feet diameter.  A great part of the circle has of late been destroy-
ed, and the stones taken away.-Some years ago, in Mr
Brown's grounds of Waterhaughs, an antient burial place was
dug up; an account of which was published at the time by
Dr. Lawrie munister of Loudoun.-At Claymore, about ten
years ago, an urn, containing some silver and other coins was
