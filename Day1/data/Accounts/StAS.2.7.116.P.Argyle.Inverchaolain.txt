on the roll is from twelve to thirteen, besides others who receive
occasional assistance.  There still remains a capital of L.60
Sterling, saved many years ago from the collections at the church
door; a legacy of L.100 Sterling, received two years ago; col-
lections at church door, about L.20 per annum.  The heritors
have been prevailed upon, of late years, to assess themselves
from L.12, 17s. to L. 13, 17s. per annum; and from these
sources, and receiving occasional small donations and legacies,
we have hitherto supplied the necessities of the poor, giving
them from L.2 to L.8 per year, according to their necessities,
so that there is not a beggar in the parish.  The people in general
are very kind to the poor, and there has not been, for a great many
years, any who went beyond the bounds of the parish to seek
alms, except two who were weak in the mind, and could not be
prevented from wandering.  There is generally a great aversion
on the part of the poor to seek parochial aid.
   Friendly Society.-There is a Friendly Society which has exist-
ed for upwards of half a century, and does much good.
   Fairs, &c.-There is but one fair held in the parish.  There are
four public-houses.
   Fuel.-Coals are principally used, and cost from 13s. to 15s. per
ton, conveyed by water; peats are also used, but it is difficult to
procure them.
