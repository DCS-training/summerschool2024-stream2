	16			SUTHERLANDSHIRE.

	a great length of time, till, in 1814, it was roofed and repaired;
	it has since been occupied as a court-house, a record-room, and
	a jail.  The number of prisoners in the jail during the year 1833
	was 20.  Of these three were for debt, six for smuggling, one
	for theft, and ten for assaults of various kinds.  The prison is,
	upon the whole,comfortable and well-secured.  One of the surgeons
	in the parish has a salary for attending any of the prisoners when
	sick.
	   Inns, &c.-In the town there is an excellent principal inn; and
	also two houses licensed to sell whisky.  One of these with the inn
	would be quite sufficient.  There are two other respectable inns
	in the parish, one at the Meickle Ferry, and another at Clashmore.
	There are three licensed houses in the parish, all of which could
	be well dispensed with, as they prove injurious to the morals and
	the means of the people, particularly of the young, among the work-
	ing-classes.  It should be stated to the credit of the magistrates
	here, as well as throughout the county, that they have suppressed
	several of these dram-shops.
	   Fuel.-Coals imported from Newcastle have been used here by
	the better classes in town and country, for the last twenty years at
	least.  They are purchased at Dornoch, at from 1s. 10d. to 2s. per
	barrel, and carried home in carts.  Peats are still used by the com-
	mon people.
