thers.  In his gardens and pleasure grounds at Ormiston-
hill, he formed an extensive collection of rare trees, shrubs,
and herbaceous plants.  The cultivation of these, and the ac-
curate determination of their species, afforded him always an
agreeable relaxation from the more serious studies and labours
of his profession He was likewise remarkable for his criti-
cal knowledge and correct judgment in architecture and
painting.  The hall of the Royal College of Physicians in
Edinburgh is an example of the former, which was plan-
ned when he was President, and according to his directions.
The front of this building may be considered as the most
chaste and beautiful morsel of Greek architecture, that has
yet appeared in Scotland.  The acuteness of his eye, and of
his mind, in discerning the beauties and blemishes in paint-
ing, was well known to his intimate friends.  This talent
rendered him a superior judge in the disposition of grounds,
and in the arrangement of rural ornaments.  When he first
entered to the possession of Ormiston-hill, every thing about
the place was in such a ruinous state, so comfortless and so un-
promising, that he placed over the front door of the house,
EST ULUBRIS: But, by great attention and good taste,
he soon made it a commodious and pleasant residence.
While he resided here, he was accessible at all times to his
neighhours, and testified the utmost readiness to give his
valuable advice to the poor gratis on every occasion of di-
stress; and attended to them as anxiously as to those of the
first rank in the realm, for whom he daily prescribed.  In
this he seemed to be of the opinion of his famous prede-
cessor Dr Boerhaave, who used to say, that the poor were
his best patients, for God is their paymaster.
