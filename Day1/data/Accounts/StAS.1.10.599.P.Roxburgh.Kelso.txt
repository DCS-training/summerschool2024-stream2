     of Kelso

   It is matter of serious regret to every person oil feeling
and reflection, it strikes strangers with surprise, and impresses
no favourable opinion of the inhabitants, that the church-
yard, from being uninclosed should have a number of roads
running through it; and that it should be covered with the
skins of animals, which the skinners take the liberty of dry-
ing upon it; and, owing to the same cause, there is nothing
to prevent even swine from turning up the graves.  The
respect which mankind, in all ages and countries, whether
refined or barbarous, have uniformly paid to the ashes of
their ancestors, should of itself be a sufficient motive to in-
duce the heritors and inhabitants to concur in inclosing it,
and by this means to prevent strangers from entertaining
sentiments and suspicions of them, for which no other part
of their conduct can afford the least foundation.
