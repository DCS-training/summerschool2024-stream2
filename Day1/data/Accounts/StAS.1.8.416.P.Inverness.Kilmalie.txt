   Looking to the east, Loch-Laggan appears, and to the
south-east, Loch-Rannoch in Perthshire.  But Loch-Tay,
being covered by the land, cannot be seen; nor Loch-Er-
racht.  If you have a good map in company, lay it here, in
a horizontal position, and, placing your eye on that part of
it, where Benevis is delineated; turn it, till the natural po-
sition of Loch-Rannoch coincides with its image on the map,
and you will then have before your eye a true representation
of the objects in view.  In this manner, you will be able to
discover the names of those high mountains, which rise above
the rest; viz.  Crouchan Bhane, near Bunaw in Glenorchay;-
Shichallion, Ben-More, and Ben-Lawers, in Perthshire, Bhillan
in Glenco, Ben-More, in the island of Mull; Benuais, and
other hills in Rossshire.  The whole of the great glen of
Scotland, from Fort-George, to the sound of Mull, is, at once,
in view; comprehending the fresh water lakes of Ness, Oich,
and Lochy, and all the course of the two rivers Ness and Lo-
chy, from their source, to the place where they enter into the
salt water, running in opposite directions, the one north-east,
and the other south-west.  The extent of view, on the hori-
zon of the sea, is about 80 miles.  One sees at once, across
the island, eastward, to the German Sea, and westward, to the
Atlantic Ocean.
   Nature, here, appears on a majestic scale; and the vast-
ness of the prospect engages one's whole attention.  Particu-
lar objects are but few in number, and they of no common
dimensions; else the eye would entirely overlook them.  Such
are those high mountains already, enumerated; which rise
with sublime aspect over the other hills.  But you are in-
stantly sensible, that none of them is elevated so high as the
spot on which you stand.
   Just over the opening of the found, at the south-west cor-
ner of Mull, Colunsa rises out of the sea, like a shade of mist,
at the distance of more than 90 miles.  Shuna and Lismore,
