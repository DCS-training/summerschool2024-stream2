                        KINCARDINE IN MONTEITH.                   1261

       In referring to eminent characters who belonged to this parish,
     the late Lord Kames deserves to be particularly mentioned. As
     a philosopher, an author on various subjects, a lawyer, and a judge,
     and a zealous supporter of every patriotic undertaking and useful
     improvement, his name is above all praise.   There is a painting
     of his Lordship in his robes of office as a judge in the drawing-
     room at Blair-Drummond.  There are also several original por-
     traits there by Sir Godfrey Kneller, particularly one ofthe Lord
     Chancellor Perth, and one of his brother, the Earl of Melfort.
       In the church there is an inscription in Latin to the memory of
     the late John Ramsay, Esq. of Ochtertyre, which was composed
     by himself some time before his death.  He was related to the
     family of Dundas of Manor, near Stirling, and studied as a lawyer
     at the University of Edinburgh, but did not follow the law as a
     profession.  He was very indulgent to his tenants, was a kind
     friend, an intelligent country gentleman, and was highly esteemed
     by all classes of the community.  He composed several epitaphs
     in Latin, of which the one in the church is a good specimen.  He
     died in March 1814.  His name appears in Dr Currie's edition
     of our poet Burns's works, as one of the correspondents of the
     poet, who was a visitor at Ochtertyre.
