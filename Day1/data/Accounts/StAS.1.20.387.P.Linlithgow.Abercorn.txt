pursued at present.  The instruments of agriculture, the
method of dressing the fields for different crops, and the ro-
tation of cropping them, do not differ in any material re-
spect from what obtains in the various districts of the Lo-
thians.  The drill-husbandry, and the advantage of green
and white crops alternately, are fully understood, and prac-
tised as generally as circumstances will admit.

   Draining.-From the variety of surface, and the great
diversity of substances which form the bottom, draining has
been experienced to be particularly necessary here, as in-
deed it has generally been in the arable districts of Scotland.
The business is well understood, and though much has been
done, chiefly by the proprietors, much still remains.  The
indispensable necessity of draining wet lands appears every
season, when they are in tillage; but when they are in pa-
sture, it does not appear in the same striking and for-
cible point of view.  On the contrary, a certain proportion
of wet land was formerly considered as advantageous in
pasture fields.  This idea is now justly exploded by intelli-
gent farmers; for though cattle, in the drought of summer,
sometimes do betake themselves to the coarse grass which
grows on marshy and wet spots, it is only when the finer
and more nutritive food on the dry land, which they al-
ways prefer, becomes scarce.  Such corners, therefore, not
only injure the beauty of pasture fields, but diminish their
value.  As the theory is improved in this particular, a
corresponding change begins to obtain in practice; and
it is probable, the conviction that wet is as injurious to the
valuable grasses as to corn, will soon extend that care to pa-
stures, which has hitherto, with few exceptions, been confin-
ed to lands in tillage.
