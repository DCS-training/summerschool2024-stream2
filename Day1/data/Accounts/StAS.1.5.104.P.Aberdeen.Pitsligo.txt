assists them.  There are some, however, in greater necessity,
who receive yearly more than twice that sum.  The poot
in Sir William Forbe's lands, and in other parts of the pa-
rish, have been greatly assisted for some time past, by liberal
donations of meal and money from that gentleman.

   Improvements Suggested.-This parish presents a very ob-
vious means of improvement in agriculture, which is, to
divide and inclose the ground with stone dikes, or other sen-
ces.  There is no spot in the country better adapted for that
purpose.  The inclosures ought to be so contrived as to con-
tain water in them; and if proper terms were concerted be-
tween the heritors and their tenants, for including the fields,
it would contribute greatly to the convenience of the far-
mer, and the melioration of the soil.  The heritors seem to
be sensible of the propriety of this improvement, and are ta-
king measures for carrying it into effect.  Sir William For-
bes has lately, at his own expence, inclosed and laid out in
grass about 100 acres of his lands in this parish.  Mr William
Gordon has ionclosed about the same extent of a farm, which 
he holds in lease from Lord Gardenston, and has, in a very
few years, brought the land into a state of high improve-
ment*.
   Another improvement, which this place stands greatly in
need of, is the introduction of manufactures, by which em-
ployment might be given to more hands, and more money
brought into circulation.  Between Peterhead and Banss,
which is a distance of nearly 40 miles, there is no manufac-
ture of importance.  Hence the large towns have increased
greatly, and the country is drained of people and of money.

<FOOTNOTE>

*An error still prevails, among many farmers in this place, of keeping too
many small horses, and doing no work with oxen, which are on many ac-
counts more profitable.
