Of there 535 families, there are 506 married and widows,
and only 29 heads of families unmarried, (of these about 20
females).  The children under the age of seven are, in Salt-
coats, very near a fifth part; in Stevenston and the country,
very near a fourth part of the whole inhabitants.  All the
individuals do not actually reside in the parish; they have,
however, no fixed house or residence but there.

   Different Classes.-About ten years ago, a Relief Meeting-
house was built near Saltcoats.  There are about 80 families
in this parish of that persuasion, 14 families of Burghers and
Antiburghers, and a single Cameronian.  Three persons in
the parish were born in England, five or fix in Ireland, and
more than a half of the heads of families born in other dis-
tricts of Scotland.  There are 20 families of farmers, and
six or eight cottagers, or persons in that stile, though they
may hold their small possessions from a proprietor.  The
number of those individuals in the parish who are and have
been sailors cannot be ascertained, probably between two and
three hundred.
