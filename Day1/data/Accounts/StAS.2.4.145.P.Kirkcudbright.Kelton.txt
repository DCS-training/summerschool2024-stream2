in height, until they attain an altitude of 1200 feet. The high-
est points are Bengairn, the Skreel, and Dungyle. From Ben-
gairn or the Skreel, when the state of the atmosphere is favour-
able, the view is remarkably beautiful and extensive. Throughout
its whole extent, the vale of the Dee, rich in natural and artificial
beauties, visible. Running along the silvery line of the river,
the eye naturally rests upon the lofty Cairnsmuir of Carsphairn,
overlooking the Kells range of mountains, which separates the
stewartry from Ayrshire. On the east and north-east are seen
Criffel, Queensberry and the mountains in the north of Dumfries-
shire. Towards the west appear Cairnharra, and Cairnsmuir of
Fleet, and on the south, the sea--(in the midst of which appears the
Isle of Man)--lies immediately below. From St Bee's Head--
like a giant guarding the entrance into the Solway Frith--stretches,
in an easterly direction, the bold outline of the Cumberland moun-
tains, with the line of cultivation, the rich fields, towns, and vil-
lages that adorn the coast of England, distinctly visible. Immedi-
ately on the east of Bengairn, and separated from it by a deep
and narrow ravine, rises the wild and rugged Skreel, beneath which,
on the north-east, is the green hill of Dungyle, whose summit
was once crowned with a strong fort, in which the British sought
shelter from the Roman invader.
	Climate.--The climate is very variable, generally moist, yet
mild, pleasant, and salubrious. The springs are cold, the sum-
mers rainy, the autumns mild, and the winters not severe.
	The following is a correct register of the rain that has fallen in
the parish of Kelton during each month within the time specified,
as shown by the rain-gauge kept by Mr Joseph Train, in Castle
Douglas. The rain-gauge was erected on the 1st March 1837,
and the observations ceased in June 1841.
