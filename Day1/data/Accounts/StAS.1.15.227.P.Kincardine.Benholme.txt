     of Benholme.

From the above statement it appears, that though the num-
bers in the country part is diminished 60, yet the town of
Johnshaven being 266 more numerous than it was in 1753,
the population has increased on the whole 206 since that pe-
riod.  It is evident, however, from the following tables, that
the population has been gradually diminishing since the year
1773.  The union of several small farms into one has con-
tributed to thin the country, and increase the number of
town's people.  But while one class of inhabitans was be-
coming more numerous in Johnshaven, various causes con-
spired to disperse another.  It appears, from undoubted au-
thority, that the sea-faring people, with their families, in that
town, about the year 1753, were equal to a third of the
whole inhabitants of the parish; but in 1793, they did not
exceed a-sixth part of that number; so that this class of in-
habitants has been rapidly declining for the last 40 years.
