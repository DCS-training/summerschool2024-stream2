   Population, Proprietors, Air, &c.- According to Dr.
Webster's report, the population in 1755 was 451.  From
the best information, the number of the people amounts,
at present, to 615; of whom 510 reside in Meikle Dal-
ton, and 105 in Little Dalton; and it seems probable,

Dalton, near the church, where the courts of the barony
were formerly kept; but number of inhabitants does
not now exceed 30 or 40.  The parish is the property of
7 heritors, of whom only 2 are resident.  The air is

50 years.

salmon, and sea-trouts, are caught in the seasons, as the
deep pools afford them a shelter.  It has been supposed, that

ground, from Dormont to the southward, is thought,
from many appearances, to have formerly been the chan-
nel of the river, which has been shut up and obstructed
by some convulsion of nature, by which the present
