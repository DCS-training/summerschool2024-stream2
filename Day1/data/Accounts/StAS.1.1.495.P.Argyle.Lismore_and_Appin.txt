in a direct line with those in Lismore, on the opposite coast of
Morvein, where there is no lime-stone.  But, of all the curi-
osities in this island, the most remarkable seem to be deer,
and perhaps elk-horns, of great size, and cow-horns of still a
much greater size in propotion.  The pith of one of the
latter, though much shrivelled and witherd, is 12 inches in
circumference at the root.  Tradition asserts that this island
was of old a deer-forest; and the number of deer-horns, and
a deer-skeleton found quite entire, confirms the assertion.  It
is said that the seventh most successful hunting-chace which
Fingal ever had was in this island; and the inhabitants pre-
tend to point out Slia nan ban fionn, the hill or eminence of
the Fingalian fair ladies, on which they sat to view the di-
version.

   Language.-The common language of the parish is the
Gaelic, a branch of the antient Celtric.  The names of all the
places in the parish are manifestly derived from it.  The mi-
mister preaches, in the long days, both in Gaelic and Eng-
lish; particularly in Appin, where there are some who un-
derstand English only.  It is believed that few preachers in
any part of the world, except those in the Highlahds, preach
in two languages.  This is one of the many incomveniencies
under which a clergyman labours in these extensive parishes.

   Prices of Provisions and Labour.-As there is no public
market in these parishes, there is no possibility of ascertain-
ing the price of grain of provisions.  Barley generally sells
from 18 s. to 20 s. and 21 s. the boll; meal from 14 s. to 
16 s.; butter generally for 12 s. the stone, (this stone should
be 24 lb.), and cheese for 5 s. and 6 s. the stone.  What is
sold in spring, or late in the season, is often at a higher price.
Most of the work in these parishes is managed by servants
