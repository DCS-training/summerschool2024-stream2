sidered as tutelor saint of Strachur.- Stralachlan was called
Killvorrie, from Kill, as above, and Moirre, the Virgin
Mary.  Stralachlan itself is partly derived from Lachlan,
the name of a family of considerable distinction among the
Highland clans, and whose residence has been in Stralachlan
for time immemorial.  The representative of this family is
chief of the Clan-lachlan.- This parish is situated in the
presbytery of Dunoon, and Synod of Argyle.  It is 18
English miles in length.  From the N. E. for 8 miles, it
is 6 broad; for the other 10, only 3 broad.  It is bounded
on the E. and N. E. by the united parishes of Lochgoil-

Killmun and Dunoon, and by Killmodan; on the N. and
N. W. by Lochsine, an arm of the sea, which separates it
on the N. from Inverary, on the N. W. from Glassrie.

parishes, is a point of land, stretching from N E. to S. W.

of the district, which joins Perthshire, presents a very rug-
ged and broken surface.  The mountains become gradually
lower and smoother, as you advance to the S. W.; and to-
wards the extremity, comparatively speaking, the land is
low and evenly.- There are a few spots on the banks
of the river Cur, of excellent deep soil, a mixture of loam
