ney upon their respective possession.  This is mentioned to
prove the hazard of putting too much improveable land,
in the hands of one person.  The rent per acre varies; but in 
the near neighbourhood of the village, there are some single,
acres let to tradesmen, from 20 s. to 40 s. per acre.  

   Crops.-Oats, pease, bear, or barley, and potatoes, are in
general the crops in the parish.  Of oats there is usually given
from seven to eight Winchester bushels per Scots acre of seed,
and the crop yields, from three to four returns on ordinary land.
But when the ground has been rested for some years, and en-
riched with dung and lime, from six to nine returns may be
expected.  The oats in the fertile parts of the country, will
yield from eight to nine stone of meal per boll.  But the oats, in
the upper or muir grounds, which includes by far the great-
est part of the parish, is of a much inferior quality.  The boll
will not yield above six stone of meal and seldom above three
seeds are reaped.  In these hilly grounds, little bear is sown,
or pease; but some rye, which answers much better than any
other crop.  Where the land is in any tolerable good heart,
four bushels of barley is reckoned sufficient seed for an acre.
Of common bear a larger allowance is requisite.  The barley will
weigh from forty-eight to fifty pound per bushel.  The com-
mon bear weighs less, by eight, ten, or twelve pounds.  The
season for sowing corn and pease, is any time in the month of
April, when the ground is dry, and in proper condition to re-
ceive the seed: that of bear and barley about Whitsunday.
Harvest usually commences about the middle of August; and
is generally over by the end of September.  In 1782, when
much damage was sustained in other places by an early frost,
the crops upon Stinchiar were generally cut down before it ap-
