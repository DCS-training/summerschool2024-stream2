by the town-council, who had obtained a gift of the patronage
from King Charles I. in 1638.  In the new aisle, one-half of the
gallery was set apart for the students, who had previously been
accommodated in the West Church of St Nicholas.
   The sums raised for erecting the College buildings appear never
to have been sufficient to complete them, and the whole having
been constructed when mason and carpenter work were of a very
inferior description in this part of Scotland, they required nume-
rous repairs annually.  The increase of students rendered the class-
rooms inconveniently small for many years; and in 1818, a plan
of additional apartments was made, but nothing, was done till 1824,
when, after a minute inspection by three architects, who reported
that the whole edifice was in a ruinous state, and incapable of al-
teration or repair, a memorial was drawn up, setting forth the ne-
cessity of a new structure, and application was made to the Lords
of the Treasury, to whom a plan and elevation of a new college
were submitted in the following year.  The Treasury replied
without delay, concurring in rebuilding rather than in attempt-
ing repairs, stating it to be a case in which a grant of public
money might be recommended in addition to private subscriptions,
and remitting to the Barons of the Scottish Exchequer to inquire
farther.  Their inquiries having been answered by the College,
the Treasury delayed farther steps till it should be "ascertained
how far the union of the two Universities at Aberdeen in one es-
tablisbment may be practicable," and referred to the Royal Com-
inissioners for visiting the Universities of Scotland for farther
information on that head.  This postponed any thing being done
for nine years.  The report of the Commission, which began its
sittings in 1826, was not made public till 1831: it recommended
str ongly a union of the seminaries, but towards accomplishing
which, as only general provisions and no particular plains, in a case
affecting so many complicated interests, were stated, nothing was
done; and the College received no certain hope of a public grant
till 1834, when, on their continued applications, the Treasury
made offer of the moiety of a sum of L.30,000, which, by a war-
rant dated 11th December 1826, had been set apart by the Scot-
tish Exchequer Barons "to be applied to the support of certain
Universities which were in a ruinous and dilapidated state," * and
of which the other half had been received and expended at St
