ed their sex:  Nay, even the scarlet mantle, which lately
was a badge of distinction among the daughters of farmers,
is now despised; and, O tempora! O mores! the silk-worms
of the East must be pillaged, to deck the heads and shoul-
ders of milk-maids.  The bonnet-makers of Kilmar-
nock, no longer find demand for their manufacture, from the
servant men and labourers in this part of the country; but
hats are worn both by men and boys of all ranks.  Our young
men are not to be seen, at church or market, in a coat of
their mother's spinning, but dress themselves in English
broad cloths, fashionable cotton stripes, and fine linen.  E-
very stripling, as soon as he arrives at puberty, must have
a watch in his pocket; whereas, only 42 years ago, there
were but 3 in the parish.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The parish derives se-
veral advantages from its local situation, which is in a po-
pulous, well cultivated district of the country, and not a-
bove 6 or 7 miles from 3 principal markets towns, where
the farmer finds ready sale for the produce of his dairy
and farm.  Both limestone and coals are in the parish.
The latter, at present, is not wrought, but it abounds in the
neighbourhood, and the roads to the pits and quarries are
all in excellent repair.  The farms are well inclosed and
divided, and the tenants comfortably lodged.  But among
the many advantages of the parish, there are a few disad-
vantages, and the want of manufactures in the village is
none of the least.  An individual, for 3 years past, has
made an attempt to carry on a branch of the woollen ma-
nufacture, by which he employs a few sprinsters; but want
of stock obliges him often to purchase the materials on
credit, and consequently, at a high price; and to sell the
produce instantly, at whatever ready money it will bring.
