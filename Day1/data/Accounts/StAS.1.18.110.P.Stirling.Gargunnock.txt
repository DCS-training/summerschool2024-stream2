   Population.- It appears that there has been little variation in
the population of the parish, for many years.  The cotton mills
at Balfron and Down, and the great demand at Glasgow a few
years ago, for weavers, masons, and day-labourers, considera-
bly diminished the number of souls in this parish.  The hope of
regular employment, and better wages, enticed several families
to settle in those places; where the young and the old were con-
stantly occupied.  By the late stagnation of trade, however,
many have been obliged to return to their former occupations.
   Additions made to some farms, and the spirit of improve-
ment prevailing among the heritors, which has led them to
keep a great part of their lands in their own possession, have
banished many inhabitants from the dryfields, where the
ruins of cottages are frequently to be met with; but in the
mean time, the village of Gargunnock, which in the memo-
ry of some still alive, consisted only of 3 or 4 houses, now
contains about 400 souls.
