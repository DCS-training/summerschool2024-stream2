     of St. Ninians.

similar intimation is given from the precentor's desk, after
divine service is concluded.
   These meetings provide for, and superintend the building
and repairing of the church, manse, school-house, manse-of-
fice-houses, and the walls of the glebe and church-yard.
They have a right to inspect the expenditure of the funds
committed to the management of the Kirk Session.  They
have a right to inspect the expenditure of vacant stipend.
They have at present the principal management of the pro-
vision made for the poor.  They almost alone nominate to
the office of schoolmaster; and as landholders in the parish,
they have a limited right to vote in the election of ministers,
serving in the church established by law.  Every cause is
determined by a majority of votes.  Records of their transac-
tions are kept by their clerk, and appeals may be made to
the Court of Session, from any decision supposed to be illegal
or irregular.
   The considerable estates, are Touch, Touch-adam, and
Polmaise, Sauchie, Bannockburn, Craigforth, Auchenbowie,
Stuart-hall, Throsk, Carnock, Grunyards, Plean, and lands
belonging to the town and hospitals of Stirling.  Few of the
proprietors of these estates reside in the parish.

   Population.-Though the inhabitants of the parish have
been frequently numbered, we are not able by authentic re-
cords, to ascertain its ancient population.
   In the year 1755, the population returned to Dr Webster,
amounted to 6491.  In 1792, it amounted to 7079.  It is
beyond a doubt, that the population of the parish is increas-
ing.  The decrease of population by the uniting of farms in
the country, is more than compensated by the increase of the
inhabitants in the village.
