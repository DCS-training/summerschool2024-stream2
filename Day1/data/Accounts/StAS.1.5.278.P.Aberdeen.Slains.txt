employed to gather the bait.  About the one half of the fish
caught here is carried in boats to Leith, Dundee, or Perth;
the other half is caried by the women to Aberdeen,
Old Meldrum, or the country, or sold at home.  For three
years past, the tacksman of the water of Ythan has bargain-
ed for all the ling and cod cought here, from 1st October
to 1st February, at 6 d. each ling, and 4 d. each cod, above
18 inches long, and at 2 d. between 18 and 12 inches each.
At this season they cannot get their fish dried, and so can-
not carry them to a better market, not being in the prac-
tice of barrelling them up themselves, as he foes.

   Caves.-Along the shore there are many caves.  They
seem to be natural; some of them are very large; one of them
is nearly 200 yards long, and at some parts about 20 feet 
high.  Another of these caves, well known by the name of
the Dropping Cave, or the White Cave of Slains, is visited
by most strangers, who come near the place, it being justly
esteemed a rarity.  The sea reaches to the mouth of it, at
high water.  Upon entering, one sees  the water oozing
through a spungy porous rock on the top and sides, which
falls down in pretty large drops, like a very moderate
shower; these drops are of a remarkable pertrifying nature.
They gradually and imperceptibly, (not instantane-
ously, as has been said,) line the cave with curious sta-
lactical incrustations, in very different and strange forms; a
great deal of these incrustations was taken out some years
ago, and turned into lime.  It is again petrisied all over,

thing to tha tackman, whose demands are annually increasing.  The
proprietor of the fish towns, not adverting perhaps  to these consequences,
exchanged his chance of the fishing for the whole profits of the ferry-
boat, on the part of the water, wih the proprietor on the opposite side,
about 15 years ago.
