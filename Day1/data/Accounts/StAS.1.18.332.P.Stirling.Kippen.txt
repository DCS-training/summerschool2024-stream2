clans, which were situated on the borders of the low country,
were accustomed to subsist in a great measure, by rapine and
plunder.  In the year 1691, a party of these free-booters
visited this parish, to the great terror and lots of the country.
They were commanded by old Rob Roy, a robber by proses-
sion, who pretended to have a commission from King James
"to plunder the rebel whigs."  The peaceable inhabitants
were obliged to flee for their safety, and leave their property
to the rapacity of this banditti, who seized upon cattle, vic-
tual, furniture, etc. and carried away as much as they were
able.  Only one man, servant to Sir James Livingston, was
killed upon that occasion.  This act of depredation was re-
membered by the fathers of several persons still living, and is
known by the name of the berriship* of Kippen.-In the year
1745, the rebel army passed the Forth by the ford of Frew
on their way to Stirling.  The inhabitants were obliged to
furnish provisions for the supply of their immediate necessi-
ties; but their march was not marked by any other acts of
violence.

   Population.-It is probable, that the parish of Kippen was
more populous in former times, than it is at present.  The
enlargement of the farms, necessarily occasioned the fall of
the cotteries, which afforded subsistence to many families.
In consequence of the encouragement offered by the manu-
facturing companies, lately established at Balsron, many fa-
milies as well as individuals have removed to that village.
A considerable decrease has taken place within these last 10
years.
   In 1755, the number of inhabitants, according to Dr
Webster's account, amounted to
