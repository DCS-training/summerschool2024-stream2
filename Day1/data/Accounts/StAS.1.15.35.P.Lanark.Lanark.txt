ven by one and the same aqueduct.
   In march 1786, the spinning commenced, and notwith-
standing of the severe check by the total destruction of
the first mill, the manufactory has been in a constant
progressive state of advancement.  In March
from an accurate account then taken, it appears there
were 981 persons employed at the mills whereas there
are now (November 1793) 1334.
   As already said, there are four houses built for the
purposes of spinning, the dimensions of which are as un-
der.

The second is the only one as yet completely filled, and con-
tains about 6,000 spindles.  The first one which was burned,
and now rebuilt has only at present 4500 spindles.  In the
third mill, a considerable number of patent jennies are
now going by water, being the first of the kind in Great Bri-
tain:  This invention, and for which, a patent, has lately
been obtained, we owe to the genius and spirited indus-
try of, Mr Willam Kelly of New Lanark*.  There are

*This gentleman has also lately discovered a new method of erecting the
great gear or large machinery of cotton mills, so as to require one fourth of
less water than commonly needed: and which is also applicable to corn
mills.  This mode is not only less expensive but requires less trouble than
old one.  It also has the benelovent tendency of preserving the lives of
children and others that may be entangled by the drum or shaft.  He has
been honoured with the thanks of the Board of Trustee, with whom he has
deposited a model of his improvements.
