   Farms, etc.-The farms in the parish, are of various ex-
tents; from 20 to 400 acres, and the rents different, from 
5 s. to L. 1, 10 s. the acre, according to the soil and situa-
tion.  A great many farms in the parish, belonging to the 
estate of Craighall, were feued about the beginning of the 
present century; there, owing to the rise of the value of 
land, and improvements in agriculture, although feued out 
at the full rent, are now become of greater value to the 
feuers to the superior.-Upon the different farms, a 
cottager, as he is commonly called, a cotter, is kept for 
each plough employed on the farm.  He is bound to serve 
the farmer in all sorts of necessary labour, and is allowed, 
besides, his house, a small yard for raising kitchen stuffs, 
ground for a certain quantity of flax and potatoes, has a 
cow kept for him throughout the year, and receives L. 4 
or L. 5 in money.  Experience has proved this plan to be 
advantageous both for masters and servants.  These cotta-
gers are generally married, and have families, which afford 
a supply of useful hands, both for agriculture and manufac-
tures.  The wages of a man servant, not a cotter, are a-
bout L. 8 yearly; the wages of a maid servant, L. 2 10 s.
or L. 3 a-year.  Day labourers receive 1s. a-day, in the 
time of harvest; and on pressing occasions, more is given. 

<FOOTNOTE>

*About 50 years ago, there were fewer than 20 flocks of sheep 
kept in the parish; which, allowing ten score to each flock, would make 
the whole number of sheep, 4000.  The flocks are now reduced to two.
