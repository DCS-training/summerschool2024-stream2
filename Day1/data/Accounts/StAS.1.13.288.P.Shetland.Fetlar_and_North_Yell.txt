Shetland, which, as above observed, they did between the
8th and 9th century, the settlers here were supplied with
all their necessaries from the Kings of Norway, and there
were ships fitted out for the purpose, of a particular construc-
tion, called Scudas, who carried from Norway wood houses,
and other necessaries for the new colonists, and brought
back with them again the Kings's rent, viz. cess, scatt and
wattle: for which there was paid butter, and a king of cloth
called wadmall.  This trade continued during all the time that
this Lordship was subject to the Danes.  At the end of the
12th century the people in this Lordship began to trade to
Norway on their own bottoms; this trade continued till
the time of Patrick Earl of Orkney, who, among the rest
of his enormous crimes, robbed the Nisbets of Kirkabiscet-
ter, heritors in this parish, of the last vessels used in the
trade.  About time the merchants in Bremen had the
whole trade in this county, till such time as the gentlemen
in the country found it convenient to take their fisheries
into their own hands, when Government thought proper to
encourage thereto, by giving them such large debentures
for the fish exported. Within these 40 years trade has
undergone the greatest change perhaps of any small part in
the kingdom.  At that period we had no trade with Eng-
land, and our trade with Scotland and Hamburgh was very
trifling.  Now we have no less than 8 vessels, who trade
to england, Leith, Holland, Hamburgh, and Bergen, ex-
clusive of 5 or 6 ships, which we annually load for the 
Mediterranean.
