   Proposed Improvement.-As neither inclosures nor winter
herding, have as yet taken place, green crops are of course
unattended to, among the common people.  The proprietors and
gentlemen, whose attention is directed to farming, carry on
their operations on a more liberal and extensive plan.  Im-
provers, conversant in every branch of agricultural employ-
ment; with farms worth 100 L. or upwards, of yearly rent; in-
closures, green crops, implements of the most approved construc-
tion, and labouring cattle of due size and estimation, are what
justly entitle them to the appellation of farmers.  Their
praise would be great indeed, if, by granting longer leases to
the tenants, they could persuade them once to begin the busi-

aloud, and has cried for ages, for the advantages of the spade
and the plough, in former times, and even these not long

equivalent, which tenants paid for the lands they occupied.
Besides money and victual, a vast variety of different articles
was demanded from the farmer.  A system of that sort sug-
gests a variety of reflections, with which the dignity and hap-
piness of man are deeply connected.  These customs, as they
are called, are now for the most part converted into money.
Unlimited services are no longer exigible.  In one half of
the parish, two days in spring, and two in harvest, are the
stipulated service; nor is this invariably exacted.  From the
operation of present arrangements, in a very short time the
other half will be equally free.  Emancipation is every where
prevailing, and the monster Feudalism is hiding his head in
shame.

   Black Cattle and Pasturage.-Canisbay, notwithstanding its
boundless extent of hill pasture, is not to be reckoned a cattle
parish.  To descend to a particular enumeration, of the horses
