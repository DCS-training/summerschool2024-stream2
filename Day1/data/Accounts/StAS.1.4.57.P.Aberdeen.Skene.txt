     PARISH OF SKENE.

     (COUNTY OF ABERDEEN.)

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES HOGG.

     Name, Situation, Soil, etc.

   ACCORDING to tradition one of the progenitors of the
present laird of Skene is said to have killed a boar
that endangered the King's life, Malcolm Kenmore, with a
knife or dagger, called in Gaelic, a Skian, and received
as reward the greater part of the lands in the pa-
rish.  Hence the name of the family of Skene, and that of 
the parish.  The parish is situated in the county of Aber-
deen, and lies from 6 to 12 measured miles N. W. from
the town.  It is in the Synod and Presbytery of Aber-
deen.  Its extent in circumference is nearly from 20
to 24 measure miles.  The form is nearly oval;
the lenght is 6, and the breadth from 3 to 4 measur-
ed miles.  It is bounded on the E. by the parishes of New-
hills and Peterculter; on the S. by Peterculter; on the
W. by Echt and Cluny; on the N. W. by Kemnay; and
on the N. by Kintore and Kinellar.  The appearance of the 
country is hilly and rocky.  The nature of the soil is va-
rious; the predominant quality is that of gravel.  Some
spots are fertile enough, others very barren.  The air is
sufficiently dry and healthy.  The most prevalent dis-
tempers are fevers.  The parish abounds with mineral
springs.  These might be rendered serviceable in scorbutic
