Dundee at that period amounted to about L. 57,000 per annum,
the stamp duties included therein being L. 1000.  The following
state, though not scrupulously correct, is within the truth, and
serves to show the progress of taxation, as well as of mercantile
transactions, at the present time.

	Customs,              	     L.	68,085    2  6
	Stamps,                         14,246    3  6

	Coach do.                     	   846    7  7
	Pamphlet do.                         0    6  0
	Malt,                       	 4,290   15  5
	Candies,                      	   746   19  4

	Land-tax and town-cess,          1,905    7  7  without burgh.
				         2,592    2  7 within   do.
	Post-office,                     7,100    0  0
	Sundries, say,                  70,227   10  7 1/2

	In the above sum the amount actually paid in Dundee is noted.
The tax on tea, &c. is paid in London and elsewhere, and would
add greatly to the above.  The taxes on candles, beer, and hides
have been abolished; while those on glass, soap, &c. have not
been received,--there being, as formerly stated, no works of those
kinds in Dundee at present.  Although the tax continues to be
paid on the whole of these articles consumed in the parish, the last                                                  med in the parish, the last
item in the preceding statement is calculated on an average of the
present population with that of 1792, and the average is taken at
not more than two-thirds of the probable amount,--making the
whole paid in cess and taxes for the town and parish at least
L. 196,392, 5s. ld.  Sterling.
	This division of the Report may be concluded with the follow-
ing statement, which is interesting, in connection with the recent
alteration in the representation of Scotland.
