vince of tile minister and elders, who make it their business
to become acquainted with the situation of the parishioners,
to supply such as are in want, and to discountenance beg-
ging.  Few beggars of course belong to this parish; but it
is much infested by vagrants, especially from the North.
Besides the other charitable donations, under the manage-
ment of the kirk-session, there is a fund for teaching poor
scholars, and supplying them with books.  An annual col-
lection is likewise made at the church doors, for the Infir-
mary of Aberdeen, which entitles the poor to medical ad-
vice and assistance, when they labour under any bodily dis-
tress, and likewise to proper accomodation, while their cure
is performing.  In few places, perhaps, are the industrious
and deserving poor better provided for than here.  Besides
the sources of assistance already enumerated, they find a con-
tinual supply in the charitable disposition of their more opu-
lent neighbours.
