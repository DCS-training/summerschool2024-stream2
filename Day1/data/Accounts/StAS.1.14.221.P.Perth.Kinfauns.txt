   These are the statements in the parish record.  But
it is to be observed, in explanation of above, that
wherever there are sectaries in a parish, the entries upon
the register of the establishment are not only irregularly
made, and the numbers of the different years thus ren-
dered disproportionate, but they are sometimes neglect-
ed altogether.

labour, and the want of a healthy, robust set of men to recruit our fleets
and armies, in any national emergency, are natural consequences of a thin
population.  In harvest 1792, before the manufactures met with any
check, journey men weavers, who used formerly to reap in harvest, and
earn 1 L. 4 s. and 1 L. 5 s. for 3 weeks labour, refused to work under 2 s. and
2 s. 6 d. a-day, which they could make at the loom.  Aset of healthy cot-
tagers, and their families, would have prevented such hardship, and ren-
dered most essential service to their masters at that critical season.
