no school in the isle of North Ronaldshay for 25 or 30 years
past; and yet almost all the young people can read, and u-
pon examination, appear to be as well acquainted with the
scriptures, and the principles of the Christian religion, as
they are in many places where regular schools are established.
As the farms there are all small, they have a great deal of
spare time, and the parents then teach their children to read.
   Ladykirk parish school.-The school of this parish has
been established and continued for 40 or 50 years, or more.
It is not a parochial school, nor is the schoolmaster paid from
the heritors and tenants as these are.  He is paid from a do-
nation or mortification for this purpose.  The intention of
the donor, it is said was, that he should teach the children
of the poor people upon one estate only; for the school is
placed on this estate, at the extremity of the parish, and he
has not a house large enough to contain many scholars.  He
seldom has above 6 or 8 scholars, and these are mostly from
the estate from which he is paid; but he does not refuse
those that chuse to come to him from any other part of the
parish.  He says he receives no school fees; and his yearly
salary, as paid from the above estate is 9 meels bear or bigg,
equal to about 5 bolls bear.-4 settings oatmeal, equal to a-
bout 1 boll oatmeal.-12 merks butter, equal to about 16
pounds weight.-Value about 2 l. or 2 l. 5 s. Sterling.

   Alehouses and Inns.-About 15 or 20 years ago, there were
