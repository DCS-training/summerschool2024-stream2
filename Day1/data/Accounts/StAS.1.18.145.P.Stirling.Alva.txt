ther vestiges of his works, are still to be seen.  And so noble
a spirit of enterprise did that gentleman possess, that he cut a
canal, a considerable way along the banks of Devon, in order
to convey his coal to the banks of the Forth, to be exported
from thence to a proper market.  The remains of this canal
can easily be traced.  More than twenty years ago, accurate
surveys, of the different levels of the water of Devon, were
taken as high up as the parish of Dollar, with a view to faci-
litate the transporting of coal, belonging to the different pro-
prietors on the banks of the river, by means of a canal intend-
ed to have been made where it should have been requisite;
as, in many places, the current of the river is so smooth and
gentle, as to render one entire canal altogether unnecessary.
Although this project was laid aside, yet in some future
period it may perhaps be resumed.  It is highly proba-
ble, that the present proprietor of this parish, will judge it
proper to begin without delay to work the coal upon
his estate, for this good reason, that the demand for that
article is daily increasing; and there is every prospect that
it will continue to increase, in consequence of the prodi-
gious consumption of Lord Cathcart's coal, by an iron
work, lately erected on that Nobleman's estate, near the
banks of Devon.  No part of it is now sold for the use of
the country.
   In a description of this kind, it would be inexcusable to omit
taking notice of the beautiful plantations of trees, which sur-
round the house of Alva; which are planted in the hedge rows
of the several inclosures, and on the brow of that eminence,
on which the house stands.  On this, there is a small forest,
consisting of many different kinds of trees, such as oaks,
elms, ashes, beeches, larches, and pines of different sorts.
Many of these, the oaks in particular, seem to be of conside-
