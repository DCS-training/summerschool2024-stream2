its appearance about 7 o'clock in the evening, moving in a
rapid and majestic manner, something in a direction from
N. W. to S. E. having its visible magnitude equal to that
of the full moon, and a light much superior; at length it
disappeared as it were in the ocean.  This meteor must have
been of prodigious bigness, its velocity immense, and its
altitude many miles.-The common people here make use
of the ordinary scottish dialect, with less tone than they
speak in Fife, though not near so short as they do in Aber-
deenshire.  With regard to the names of places in the pa-
rish, many of them seem to be of Gaelic or Celtic extrac-
tion.-Property in land here is very often changing; of
this there have been no less than four material instances in
the united parish of Logie and Pert, within 8 or 10 years
past, and during that period, or little more, near the banks
of the Northesk, and within the extent of 5 or 6 miles, no
fewer than 8 estates have been in the market, and changed
their proprietors.  This rapid alienation of property, may
in one instance or two be accounted for on political consi-
derations, but is chiefly imputable to the two following
causes:-Some of the old proprietors having been men of
pleasure, and not sufficiently attentive to their worldly in-
terest, were obliged to sell their land from the impulse of
necessity, or pecuniary embarrassment; others of them, a-
gain, who had several children, having, in contradiction to
the old feudal spirit, made liberal provision in their settle-
ments for the younger branches of their families; this ren-
dered the sale of their estates unavoidable on their demise.
Land sells here at 25 or 30 years purchase, and seems to be
on the increase.-The people are by no means ungenerous
or uncharitable, according to their circumstances; if at any
time they see virtue or industry in distress, their chearful and
ready support is not wanting; but when vice is plunged
into wretchedness, perhaps their pity is too much withheld,
