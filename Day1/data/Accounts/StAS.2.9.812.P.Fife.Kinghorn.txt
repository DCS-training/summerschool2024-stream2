	   Rent.-The rent of land in this parish varies from L.1 10s. to		
	L.6 per acre.  The average is about L.3, 10s. per acre.	
	   Stock.-There are few cattle reared in this parish.  Those that
	are reared are of the Fife and short-horned breed, with crosses
	between them.  Although there are few reared, yet a great num-
	ber, brought from other counties, are fattened in this parish, and
	from the attention paid to their condition and appearance, fre-
	quently bring high prices L.25 and L.30 being no uncommon
	price for them per head.
	   Much attention has of late been given to sheep feeding.  A
	considerable number are now kept, chiefly half-bred Cheviot, and
	black-faced.  These, like the cattle, are generally imported from
	other places.
	   Few parishes have undergone more improvements than this in
	draining and trenching, or can exhibit such an activity and atten-
	tion in the application of all recent discoveries to bring the land to
	the highest state of cultivation and productiveness.  The farm-
	buildings and enclosures are in general very good, and show both
	the good taste of the tenant, and the encouragement of the land-
	lord.  The duration of leases is nineteen years.
	   Manufacturers.-The only manufacture carried on in Kinghorn
	is the spinning of flax.  The raw material is imported, and it un-
	dergoes here all the processes from their, dressing of the flax, up to
	the final preparation of the yarn and thread, for the loom and
	otber purposes.
	   There is an extensive bleaching field at Nether Tyne, about
	
	beyond the boundary line of the burgh including fen-duties, is L.10,684, 5s. 9 1/2d.
	The rental within the burgh boundary is about L.2000.
