wright, 3 gardeners, 2 sawers, 2 carriers, 2 butchers, 1 musician,
2 calenderers, 6 hatters, 3 painters, 1 nailer, 4 toll-keepers, 60
labourers, 3 surgeons-there are 7 in all.
  Agriculture.-The lands are for the most part arable, but still
the proportion is not so great as might at first sight be imagined.
The total number of Scots acres in the parish is 8527; but by
the returns of Messrs Shaw and Miller, two most able practical men,
who made up an estimate of the rental of the landward part of the
parish in August 1836, which is attested by the sheriff of the
bounds, it appears that there are only 3076 acres, 2 roods, and
19 falls, under regular cultivation-, leaving an overplus of 5451
acres.A large proportion of this residuum is taken up by the
town of Kirkintilloch, and the rest by the canal, railway, public and
private roads. hedges and fences of all sorts, which are numerous,
farmhouses, streams, and burns, and a few straggling villages.
  The only uncultivated land in the parish is towards the east end,
about Stron and Barr-hill, and the mosses already alluded to. Al-
together the waste lands, with the above exceptions, do not amount
to, perhaps, more than 300 acres, if so much. To this amount
we may add other 300 acres now under wood, chiefly larch, spruce,
and Scotch fir, with a sprinkling of hard-wood. These yield good
returns, or may be expected to do so. The average rent of land
per acre throughout the parish is about L. 1, 10s. But the ave-
rage will be better shown as follows : In 131 properties in the
hands of the same number of proprietors, and of 108 tenants, the
proportion between the number of acres, and the rental per an-
num, generally on a lease of nineteen years, is as follows: I shall
put them down at random, as taken from the books of the heritors,
and from other sources of information.
