   Poor-The charity which this parish gives to the poor,
is a branch of expenditure which does it honour.  There is
collected in the church every Sabbath throughout the year at
an average 7 s. 3 d. exclusive of the larger sums collected at
the time of the celebration of the sacrament.  These col-
lections, and a considerable sum arising from money at in-
terest, with the lending of a hearse and mortcloths, and the
letting some seats in the church, more that amply supply
the necessities of the 12 poor of late years commonly on
the list, and of the two which the general dearth of last
year has added*.  Before the year 1678, several sums had

1 lib. salmon, 6 d.; a hen, 1 s. 3 d; dozen eggs, 7 d.  The price of a pair
of horses is L. 52, 10 s; harness, L. 3. 3 s.; a cart, L. 10, 10 s; a plough,
L. 2, 2 s.; a pair of harrows, L. 1, 1 s.  The wages if a male servant a-
year, are L. 10; a female servant a-year, L. 4; a male reaper, L. 1, 4 s.; a
female reaper, L. 1; a labourer a-day without board, 1 s. 3 d.  The pri-
ces of provisions, implements of husbandry, and labour, have much increa-
sed within the last 40 years.  At the commencement of that period, the
price of 1 lib. butter was 4 1/2 d. 1 lib. cheese, 1 1/2 d.; 1 lib salmon, 1 /12 d.;
a hen, 4 d.; a dozen eggs, 1 d.  The price of a pair of horses was L. 10;
harness, 5 s.; cart, 10 s.; a plough, 9 s.; a pair of barrows, 2 s.  The
wages of a male servant a-year, were L. 2, 2 s; a female servant a-year,
L. 1, 6 s.; a male reaper 11 s. 8 d.; a female reaper, 10 s.; a labourer
a-day without board, 6 d.

   *In the year 1578, the usual collection of Sabbaths was 8/12 d.; and on
June 29, the same year, the fund of the poor amounted to no more than
6 2/2 d.  These days afforded small provision for the present exigence of
the poor, ad laid up little in store against the season of uncommon need.
The cottagers gave to the masters of whom they held their little hovels,
all the children they needed as servants.  The rest found it often vain to
apply to a trade, for almost every man was his own tradesman.  Away,
therefore, they were sent by the cravings of hunger, to beg that bread
which they could not earn, and the poor preyed on the poor.  Before
1651, the times seem to have grown better; for the usual collection on
Sabbaths that year was 4 2/12 d.; and on Sabbath November 23, the
parishioners were able to collect L. 2, 5 s. for the support of their brethren in
