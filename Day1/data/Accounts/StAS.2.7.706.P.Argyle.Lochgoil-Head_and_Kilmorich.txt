high and strong wall built round the edgge of the rock. Within
this space 100 men might conveniently stand, for the defence of
the castle, if it was attacked by sea. Before the invention of
gunpowder, the castle of Carrick could on be taken by surprise;
it was scarcely possible to storm it; nor could it be taken by block-
ade, as it had always a free communication with the sea, for a
vessel of any burden will swim along the side of the rock. The
time in which this castle was built does not seem to be ascertained.
It can be traced up as far as the end of the fifteenth century, but
it is probably much older. The tradition of the country hs, that
it was built by the Danes. It was a king's house, and the Duke
of Argyle is heritable keeper of it. It was burned by the Athol men.
