   A melioration to a certain extent for building good houses,
would also contribute much to the improvement of this
country.  There is not a slated house in the parish, but the
church, one mill, a house at Lochmaddie, that was intend-
ed for a public house, and another in the Island of Vallay,
in a ruinous condition.  But if the above encouragement
was granted, the principal tacksmen would soon have slated
houses; the great quantities of straw now used for thatch
to their houses, would then become provender for cattle;
and the time employed by their servants in making
heath ropes to secure the thatch, would then be laid out in
improvements of different kinds.  The small tenants have
not much time indeed to improve their lands on account of
the round of employment already mentioned.  But if any
method could be fallen upon, that would enable them to
lessen their number of hourses, nothing could turn out more
to their advantage; using carts in place of creels, would
help much to bring about this desirable end.  If the pro-
prietor should send a quantity of seasoned wood, and some
cart-wrights to the country, so as to have carts made, a-
dapted to the small size of their horses, which might be
sold at prime cost, a great reduciton of the number of
horses might be the confequence.  In that cafe, a part of
the corn now given as provender for horses might be
saved; a part of the money sent out of the parish to
purchase them, might be otherwise employed, and the peo-
ple enabled to keep a greater number of black cattle.
It is almoust unnecessary to observe, that establishing ma-
nufactures, and erecting villages, would help much to
better the condition of the people, as then the tenant
would be furnished with a market a hand for may arti-
cles that now turn to no account.
