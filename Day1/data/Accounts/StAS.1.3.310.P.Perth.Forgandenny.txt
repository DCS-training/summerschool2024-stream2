     Statistical Account

the foot of this high hill, is a place called the Law of Dum-
buils.  It is a craggy hill, on the top of which are the ves-
tiges of a wall, whole form has also been determined by that
of the hill on which it was built.  There is nothing remark-
able in these vestiges.  They are much the fame with what 
is to be seen, on many of those mills, called Laws, and are
very probably the remains of some ancient fortification.
