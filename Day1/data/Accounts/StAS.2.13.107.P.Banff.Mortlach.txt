   romb; and Mr Duff of Drummuir. The only resident beritor is
   Mr Gregory, Buchromb.
     Upon the whole, the inhabitants are a sedate and religious
   people, and in comfortable circumstances. We hear occasionally
   of poachers in our hills; but, fortunately, illegal distillation, which
   at one time was carried on to a great extent in this parish, has of
   late, from the high fines imposed by the excise on those detected
   in it, become, it is believed, extinct.
                                 IV.-INDUSTRY.
     Agriculture.-The gross rental of the parish is, as nearly as can
   be ascertained, about L. 4500. Of 35,000, the supposed number
   of acres in the parish, 5000 may be under cultivation, 30,000 waste
   or in pasture, of which from 400 to 500 may be capable of im-
   provement, and 600 under wood, consisting principally of ash,
   elm, plane, birch, oak, Scotch fir, larch, &c.
     Rent of Land.-The land is generally rented at about L. I per
   acre, while the expense of grazing is at the rate of L. 2, 2s. per
   ox, and 2s. 6d. per ewe or full-grown sheep.
     Rate of Wayes.-Day-labourers at farm or other work receive
   from Is. 6d. to Is. 10d. per day without victuals, in winter from
   Is. to Is. 4d.; wrigbts per day of ten hours, Is. 8d. to 2s. ; ma-
   sons, do. Is. 10d. to 2s.; farm-servants by the half year, maintain-
   ed in the family, men from L. 3 to L. 6; women from L. 1, 10s.
   to L. 2, 10s.; mason-work per rood for workmanship, L. 1 to
   L. 1, 5s.; slate do. 12s. to 16s.
     Live-stock,&c.- The sheep are of the black-faced breed, and the
   cattle a cross between the Highland and Aberdeenshire breed.
      The state of husbandry is in general good, and of late much spi-
   rit in improving waste land, draining, &c. has been displayed.
      Quarries.- There are several limestone and slate quarries within
   the parish, and though there is plenty of granite also, no quarry
   of this description has been wrought.
      Produce.-According to a calculation made by an individual of
   much experience, the annual produce is as follows:

         Grain raised in the parish,                         L. 8935
         Potatoes, turnips, &c.                                 3215
