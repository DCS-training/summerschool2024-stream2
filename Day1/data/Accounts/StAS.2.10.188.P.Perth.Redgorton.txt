             Fisheries.-The Tay has long been famous both for the quan-
          tity and quality of its salmon.  But a great diminution has taken
          place of late years in the value of the fisheries.  This defalcation
          has taken place over the whole course of the river, and is to be
          ascribed partly to a decrease in the number of the fish taken, and
          partly to a fall of the price in the London market.  This defalca-
          tion has taken place to such an extent, that the rental of the river
          is not now above one-eighth of what it formerly was.  Lord Lyne-
          doch's fishing, forhnstance, in this parish, which used to bring L. 550,
          now lets for L. 65 per annum.
             Manufactures.7-Although the village of Stanley, which is con-
          nected with the extensive cotton-mills at that place, now the sole
          property of James Buchanan, Esq. of Duanhill, and his sons, be
          partly situated in this parish, yet, as the works themselves are in
          the parish of Auchtergaven, they will fall to be described in the
          account of that parish.
             It has been already stated that bleaching may be regarded as
          the staple of the manufactures of the parish.  But, besides the
          three bleaehfields at Luncaryy, Pitcairnfield, and Cromwell Park,
          there are also in the parish two power-loom establishments, a flax
          spinning-mill in operation, and a cotton spinning-mill, ready to be
          put in motion, all at Cromwell Park, where there are three falls of
          the Almond: and a flax spinning-mill at Pitcairnfield, also on the
          Almond, where there are two falls.
             Luncarty has long been considered the most extensive linen
          cloth bleachfield in Scotland.  The ground belonging to the com-
          pany extends to 130 acres and upwards, held in feu from Lord
          Lynedoch, for the payment of a feu-duty of L. 150.  The power
          required for driving the machinery is obtained by water brought
          from the Tay, by a dam dike, carried nearly across the river, and
          conveyed in a lead about two miles long, and which takes in the
          united waters of the Shochie and the Ordie, by the bed of these
          rivers being raised to the level of the lead by a powerful dike car-
