rish, the soil is capable of carrying wheat, if we knew
how to prepare the ground.

   Implements of Husbandry.-The Scotch plough is most-
ly used in this parish, and, in some few places, must con-
tinue to be used, where the ground happens to be very
unlevel, and full of large stones under the surface.  The 
tenants have no idea of the advantage of clearing away
these stones out of their ground; nay, some of them as-
sert, that there is an advantage in having them in it, be-
cause they give heat to the ground, and so contribute to
manure it.  They choose, therefore, to run the risk of break-
ing their ploughs several times in a season, and have the toil
of digging yearly about a stone, where their plough does
nto reach, rather than remove it once for all, which, in
most cases, would not be a very laborious operation.  A
few, however, make use of the English plough; and it is
to be hoped, that the rest will soon follow their example.
It is, indeed, surprising, that any farmer should want it,
as it is plain to a demonstration, that it lays the ground
infinitely better, and ploughs with much more ease to
man and horse, than what the Scotch plough does; and
the greatest part by far of the ground in this parish, is
so smooth and level, that it suits it extremely well*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Until of late, all the peats, manure, corn, &c. were carried upon
cars or sledges, but now most of those who can afford it, have got carts,
although, indeed, few have got cart roads to the peats.  These are upon
the whole, however, a great improvement, and one principal cause of
their being able to reduce the number of their horses.
