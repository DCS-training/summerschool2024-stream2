unhealthy, and never arrived to the size or fatness of the na-

heritor in this parish, has found the Cheviot breed as hardy

   Population.-The population of this parish has decreased
considerably.  About 70 years ago, the lands were occupied
by 26 tenants, but the farms have since that period been gra-
dually enlarged in extent, and of course diminished in num-
ber; even of the 15 to which they are now reduced, so ma-
ny are engrossed in the hands of the same persons, and these
often settled in other parishes, that there are only 3 farmers
at present resident in the whole parish.  The whole number
of dwelling houses is only 51, and of these 3 are inns, situated
at the Grook, Beild, and Tweedshaws, upon the high-way
from Edinburgh to Moffat, Dumfries, &c. which passes
through this parish along the banks of the Tweed, and is of-
ten, (especially in that part of its extent which lies within
this parish), in a very bad state, but will now meet with a
thorough repair.  The whole number of souls, at present in
the parish, is only 227; the return to Dr. Webster, in 1755, was
397, so that there is a decrease of 170.  Before the practice
of inoculation was introduced, the small pox frequently car-
ried off great numbers of the children.  The inhabitants of
Tweedsmuir are in general stout and healthy, and many live
to an advanced age.  During the last 10 years, there have
been 77 baptisms, 33 marriages, and 56 burials.

   Church, School, and Poor.-The church was built in 1648.
The stipend was paid some years ago, partly in grain, and
partly in money; but an equitable conversion having been a-
greed upon, at the rate of 12 s. 6 d. a boll for the gram, the whole
stipend is now paid in money, and amounts to 75 L.  Sterling
