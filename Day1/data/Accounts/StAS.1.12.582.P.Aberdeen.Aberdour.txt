has less or more of town grass.  The quantity of grain pro-
duced cannot be ascertained, as few of the farmers measure
their corns, or weigh their meal, except What part of there
they sell.

   Mode of Cultivation, etc.-Since the introduction of tur-
nip crops, the farmers, in general, take a rotation of crops
in their infields.  After the turnip crop, they sow the field
with bear, clover, and rye-grass seeds when the grass is
broken up the third or fourth year, the ground is town with
oats, next year with bear or barley, the third with pease or
turnip, and the fourth with bear and grass-seeds: But this
only during the former years of their short leases.  The out-
fields, when unimproved, are worn out with crops after lime,
are employed as folding for their cattle, or as faughs (as
they arc called), a partial kind of fallow, and according to
the old absurd practice, carry successively 3 or 4 crops of
oats.  The old Scotch plough, and a mixture of Scotch and
English ploughs, are used in this district.  Besides the dung
of their cattle and peat ashes, which are every where used as
a manure, the farmers on the sea-coast make use of sea-ware;
and they, as well as the other farmers throughout the parish,
use lime and likewise broken shells mixed with sea-sand, which
last they draw from the neighbouring parish of Pitsligo, and
which produces the same effect as lime.  This mixture of shell
and sand was discovered only a few years ago, by Mr. Wil-
liamson, a gentleman employed by the Society at Edinburgh,
for making new discoveries of mines, etc. and who recom-
mended the use of it to the late Mr. Garden of Troup, on
whose state it was discovered, who first used it himself,
and encouraged his tenants to follow his example, which
is now become the general practice.  The lime is partly
brought from the parish of Rathen, distant of 6 or 7 miles,
