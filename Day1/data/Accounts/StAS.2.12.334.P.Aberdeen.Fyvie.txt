soon find their way also among the more humble crofters, while
the families of the latter, scattered pretty equally through the pa-
rish as they are, furnish a supply of native and hardy servants,
whose early associations attach them to the district, and who are lo-
cated often, during the first part of their service, at no great distance
from the parental roof.  The system pursued in some parts of the
country of throwing large tracts of land into the hands of a few in-
dividuals, to the exclusion, in a great measure, of the smaller far-
mers, is, I conceive, in every point of view, of very doubtful advan-
tage, and in some respects a positive injury.  From the same
sources of information already referred to, together with the assist-
ance of a few experienced farmers within the parish, the following
table, shewing the present state as to cultivation, farm-stocking,
&c. with the value of the gross annual produce, has been made up
with much care.

   It is supposed that 3000 acres might be added to the present cul-
tivated land.
   Of the principal species of stock there, are: cattle, 4400; horses
employed in farm-work, 500; carriage, saddle, and young horses,
100; sheep, 1600.
   There are 7 corn-mills and 80 thrashing-mills, of which forty-
five are driven by water, and thirty-five by horses.
   Husbandry.-As appears from the preceding table, the crops
usually cultivated are sown grasses, oats, bear and barley, turnips, po-
tatoes, and to a small extent maybe added tares, pease, and flax.  The
rotation most prevalent is as seven course shift, of which three-sevenths
are in first, second, and third grass, one-seventh in green crop, one-
seventh in bear or oats, with grass seeds, and two-sevenths in oats
after lea.  A five-shift is also common, but chiefly on land of good
