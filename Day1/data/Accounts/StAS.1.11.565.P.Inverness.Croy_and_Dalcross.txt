able quality of the soil on the one hand, and their bad treat-
ment of it on the other.  It is much to be regretted, that they
cannot be prevailed upon to adopt a preferable mode of farm-
ing.  Indeed most of them are so poor, as to be scarcely able
to labour their lands in the ordinary manner; but such as are
in better circumstances are as averse to improvements, as their
poorer neighbours.  Though they have plenty of stones for
making enclosures, most of the fields are quite open; and

improvements shall be stated under the subsequent article.

in improving his estate, by cultivating and planting large
tracts of waste moor ground; by making substantial regular
fences; by liming his lands, sowing grass, and adopting the
