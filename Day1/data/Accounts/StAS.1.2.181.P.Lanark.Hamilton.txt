mains of the antient manor-house, called Cadzow-castle,
which seems to have been deserted, after the injuries which it
suffered by Regent Murray's army, are still to be seen on the
west bank of the Avon, in the middle of the great park, about
a mile from the town:  And, on the opposite side of the fame
river, stands a showy building, in imitation of a ruin, executed
from a design of the elder Adams.  It was built by the Duke of
Hamilton, about 1730, and is said to have been intended as a
representation of the castle of Chatelherault, in France, of
which his ancestors were dukes.-The town is very irregular
ly built, skirting around the bottom of a rising ground, above
three quarters of a mile in length.  It is  a considerable tho-
rough-fare, the roads from Glasgow to England, and from
Edinburg to Ayrshire, etc. passing through it.  In the mid-
dle there is prison and town-house, built in 1643, contain-
ing a court, hall, etc.-There are also convenient build-
ings for markets; in particular, one for butchers' meat, which
is in general pretty well flocked with the ordinary forts, at
their different seatons.
   The parish church is a handsome building, erected in 1732
instead of an old one, which stood hard by the palace.  It
stands upon the rising ground above the town, and makes a
very good appearance.  It was also designed by Mrs Adams.  To
wards the west end of the town, there is a large meeting-house
built by the people who were unwilling to submit to the un-
limited exercise of patronage, in 1776:  And on the east side,
a meeting-house for the people of the Antibargher persuation,
built in the year 1761; and lately repaired and enlarged.
   Near the town-house, stands an hospital or alms-house,
built instead of on which stood in the lower part of the town,
now erazed, and was endowed by the noble family of Hamil-
ton, and other pious donors.  It contains lodgings for eight
poor men, a hall for morning and evening prayers, besides
