lor, 1 s. without, or 6 d. with meat.  Work, however, is ge-
nerally done by the piece.  The average of farm servants,
when they eat in the house,is L. 7 for men, and L. 3 for
women; but the farm servants are generally paid by what is
called a benefit, before described; and if the man's wife and
children are employed by the farmer, their work is separately
paid for.  The wages of domestic servants are nearly the
same with those of farm servants.

   Expences of a Labourer's Family.  The expences of a com-
mon labourer, when married, and with four or five children,
is about L. 16 a year.  The wages which he receives, toge-
ther with the industry of his wife, enable him to live tole-
rably comfortable, and to give his children an education pro-
per for their station, provided he and his wife are sober, in-
dustrious, and frugal:  Those of them who are embarrassed
in their circumstances, owe their poverty either to their own,
or their wife's bad conduct.  That the labourers can maintain
their families at this small expence, is owing to the farmers,
from whom they have cottages, allowing them as much land
for one year's rent free, to plant potatoes in, as they can ma-
nure sufficiently with ashes, or such dung as they can provide
for themselves; and these potatoes constitute at least one half
of their year's food.

   Division and Rent of Lands.-A great part of the parish is
inclosed, but a considerable part still lies open.  The farmers
seem sufficiently convinced of the advantages of inclosing,
and would willingly allow their landlords interest for such
sums of money as would be necessary for making inclosures.

their tenants.
