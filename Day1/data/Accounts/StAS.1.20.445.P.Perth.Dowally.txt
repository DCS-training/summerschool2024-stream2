     of Dunkeld.

     ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES.

   The advantages are, 1. Being, in the language of that coun-
try, "in the mouth of the Highlands, "it must always
command a great proportion of the trade with the extensive
district beyond it.  2. Yarn and oak-bark are to be obtain-
ed, in any required qauntity, in the immediate neighbour-
hood.  3. Wages and house-rents, through high, and rapidly
rising, are yet lower than in places nearer to the centre of
population and luxury.  4. Not being a royal borough, it
is thus free from corporation restrictions, and from election
canvassing; a canvassing which, by holding out the prospect
of pleasure without expence, and of gain without labour,

lay and hazard of a ferry, over a large river, is to be en-
coutered by the way.  2. The dearness of fuel.  Coals are
never under 1 s. per cwt. and they have been occasionally
as high as 2 s.  3. The extravagant price of ground, and the
small extent, even at that price, which is, or can be expect-

bined with the last, renders the erection of machinery on a
large scale impracticable.

     HINTS FOR IMPROVEMENT.

   1. The Hill Commonty should be inclosed and planted,
or exchanged, (if the Duke of Atholl is favourable to the
