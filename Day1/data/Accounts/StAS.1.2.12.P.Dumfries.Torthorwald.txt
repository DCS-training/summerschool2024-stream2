   Observations on the Tables of Mortality.-It appears from these
tables, that the asthma, which carried off 36 souls, has been
the most prevalent distemper, and that 18 have died of rheu-

mortality of these diseases was occasioned by a great number
of the inhabitans having been in the practice of employing the
greater part of the summer, and even a good part of winter,

into this parish, and that practice has since been conti-

from the inoculated.  Hence in twelve years preceding 1776,
only two persons died here of the small-pox, whilst in
