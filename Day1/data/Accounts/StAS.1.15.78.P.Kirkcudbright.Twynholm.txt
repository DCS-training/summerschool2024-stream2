     Statistical Account

almost the whole S. W. extremity of the parish, abounds in
trouts, and also drives a barley and a corn mill.  The Lake
of Glengape abounds in large yellow trouts.  The three mills
above mentioned are remarkably well situated for exporting
their flower, barley, and meal.  The corn mill lies close upon
the small bay of the sea.  The other two lie, the one within a
mile, and the other within half a mile of the harbour above
mentioned, upon the water of Tarf, and not above two miles
from two harbours upon the water of Dee, where vessels of
considerable burthen can easily come.

   Population-As the session records have never been regu-
larly kept, the ancient state of the population cannot now
be ascertained.  The variations, however, of the number of
people within these 40 years, will appear from the follow-
ing statement.  A late act of Parliament, now repealed, pre-
vented the registration of births, marriages and burials, so
that none has been kept for some years.
