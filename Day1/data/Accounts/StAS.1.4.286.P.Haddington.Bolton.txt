other parishes; burials from 1780 to 1790, were 40; but
the session-clerk says he records only such as pay the tax
to the Government.  Marriages from 1775 to 1785, were
26.

   Agriculture, etc.-The valued rent of the parish is a-
bout L. 2400 Scots; the real rent is said to be about
L. 1400 Sterling.  The number of acres is about 2300, of
which there are about 170 planted; most of the grounds
are inclosed; some with strips of planting.  There are three
parks of Lethington in it, on the S. W. side of the water;
two of which are yearly let of pasture; the third is made
an orchard, by the last Lord Blantyre, with a small plea-
sure ground planted by the side of the water.  The other
parks of Lethington are in the parish of Haddington, in

came to Scotland in Charles II's reign, that he might show
a deer-park in Scotland.  The parish is divided into 11
farms; 2 of which are occupied by the proprietors: the
rest, partly by residing, partly by non-residing tenants.
There are 28 ploughs, 83 horses, 280 cows, and about
6 score sheep; about 150 acres are in wheat; about 120
in bear; 230 in oats; 130 in pease and beans; 200 in
clover; 190 in sallow.  I am told that bear is not culti-
vated so much as formerly, for the barley brought from
the E. coast of England is found to be of a better quality;
and the tenants rather give two furrows to their oats.
There are few turnip or potatoes raised, or lint sown, ex-
cept what is given to servants or cottagers, for carrying in
stacks.  The tenants are sometimes subjected to to kain and
carriage of coals, and thirlage to mills; others pay com-
