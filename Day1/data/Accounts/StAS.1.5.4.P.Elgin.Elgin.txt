as cathedrals, and resided near them*; and that bishop
Briceus, soon after the 1200, had the cathedral established
at Spyny.  In 1224, Bishop Andrew translated it to the
church of the Holy Trinity near Elgyn.  This building
was destroyed by Alexander, Lord of Badenoch +.  About
1397, however, it was begun to be rebuilt, but it was not
finished till after the 1414.  From the ruins which still re-

feet, and above 34 feet broad, and was not surpassed in

++A large space of ground was surrounded with a high wall, in many
places yet entire, which inclosed what is now called the college, and con-
tained, not only the cathedral and burying ground, but the houses or man-
ses, with the small gardens, that belonged to the twenty two canons, and
dignitaries of the sea.  All these have now come into lay hands, but several
of the manses are inhabited, and distinguished by the names of the canonry
they belonged to.  Within this boundary the bishop also, had a large house,
which was repaired by Bishop Hepburn, as his arms are carved on it, with
the initials of his name, P. H.
