     Of Traquair.

Seceders, mostly of the Antiburgher congregation, and 3 Ro-
man Catholics.  The proportion of the annual births to the
whole population, is as 1 to 27; the annual deaths as 1 to
38, and a small fraction.  Each marriage, at an average, pro-
duces from 5 to 6 children.  There are from 3 to 4 marria-
ges annually.  The union of farms is to be considered as the

must have given employment to a variety of labourers, must
likewise have greatly contributed.

   Stipend, Church, Manse, Poor, etc.-The value of the

8 bolls of bear.  The glebe contains about 11 Scots acres,
which, together, make the sum above specified.  The King,
in right of the Archbishop of Glasgow, is patron of the old
parish of St. Bryde.  The Earl of Traquair was patron of
the suppressed parish of Kailzie; but that family being Ca-
tholic, could claim no right in the settlement of Traquair.
The church was rebuilt about 9 years ago.  The heritors, in

manse for the present incumbent, which is not as yet finished,
and they are likewise to rebuild part of the offices, which,
when completed, will render the minister's accommodation
very comfortable.-There are, at present, 10 persons receiv-
ing alms, who are all, excepting one, who, it is said, has
been bedfast upwards of 23 years, able to do a good deal to-
wards their own maintenance.  These 10 persons are upon
the session's roll, and the annual amount of money for their

have their fuel brought home by their masters.
