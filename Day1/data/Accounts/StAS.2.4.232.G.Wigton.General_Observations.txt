The followinf communication on the interesting antiquity called
	the Deil's Dike, has been received from Mr JOSEPH TRAIN,
	Castle-Douglas, a zealous and distinguished antiquary.
  "My attention was, for several years, occasionally occupied in tra-
cing the vast rampart called the Deil's Dike through Galloway and
Nithsdale. It commences at Lochryan in the farm of Beoch, near
the site of the ancient city of Berigorium, where Agricola, the
Roman General, had a statinn. *  Thence it extends through the
farms of Braid, Auchenvane, Kirnevarn, and Kilfedder. From
Kilfedder, it takes an easterly direction from the farm of Derry,
and passes by the north end of Loch Maberrie. It passed the old
Kirk-yard of Kirkcalla; but about the commencement of the present
century, the stones were carried away to make Ring Fences in the
neighbourhood. In the adjoining farm of Ocheltree, this ancient
structure runs from the east side of the loch to the summit of the
hill, where there are the remains of a watch-tower made of very
large stones. Along the whole line of the Deil's Dike, there is no
other place from which a sentinel could have had such a command-
ing view of the surrounding country.  From the hill of Ocheltree,
the dike extends along the farm of Glenvernock. Immediately

<FOOTNOTE>I have seen the head of a Roman spear which was found there. In the year
1825, this remnant of antiquity was in the possession of Mr Mackenzie of Stranraer.
