Rev. Mr Aitken, and his colleague, the Rev. Mr, Anderson, have
each L. 60 per annum. There is also an Episcopalian chapel.
	The great body of the people, however, is attached to the Esta-
blished Church, and the number of Dissenters and Episcopalians
cannot be estimated at more than one-seventh part of the population.
About 300 (1831) attend the meeting in connection with the Ori-
ginal Constitutional Synod, 200 of whom are communicants; fully
more attend the meeting in connection with the United Secession
church; 220 are communicants, 13 of whom come from adjoining
parishes.
	The congregation in connection with the Relief is only forming,
and the communicants (1831) are not above 40. There are now
upwards of 200 communicants. The Independents consist only of a
few families. The Episcopalians are not numerous.
	Divine service at the Established Church, and, I understand,
also at the several chapels, is generally well attended. The com-
municants in connection with the Established Church are not fever
than 2500. In 1830, the number of actual communicants was
2021, and in the chapel at Glenprosen, 189; in all, 2210.
	Societies for Religious Purposes.--There are several societies for
religious purposes established in the parish. 1. Bible Society, auxi-
liary to the Bible Society of Edinburgh; 2. Missionary Society,
auxiliary to the Missionary Society of Edinburgh; 3. Ladies' So-
ciety for promoting the Education of Females in India; 4. Sabbath
School Society. Probable average amount of the yearly contribu-
tions to the societies:--The Bible society was instituted in 1821,
since which, L. 122, 8s. 1d. have been collected; or on an ave-
rage, L. 12, 4s. 9 1/2d. per annum; the Missionary society was insti-
tuted in 1821, since which, L. 368, 2s. 7d. have been collected;
or on an average, L. 36, 16s. 3d. per annum; the Ladies' society
was instituted in 1823, since which, L. 45 have been collected; on
an average L. 5, 12s. 6d. per annum; Sabbath School society was
instituted in 18l7, since which, L. 18 per annum have been col-
lected. The probable annual amount of church collections for
religious purposes, exclusive of what is collected for the poor, is
about L. l4.
	Education.--The total number of schools in the parish (1831) is
16,--1 parochial school, 2 endowed schools, 12 unendowed schools,
and one supported by subscription of individuals. The Greek,
Latin, and French languages, with practical mathematics and geo-
graphy, are taught in the parochial school, where the average num-
