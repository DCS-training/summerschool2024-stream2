ferent situations.  That part of them which separates Forbes
and Kearn, and which is about 5 miles over, is called Coreen,
which, they, who are acquainted with the Gaelic, say, signifies
the Hill of the Muirfowl, and with which, indeed, it pretty
much abounds.  On the S. E. side of this mountain, and on
a gentle declivity, extending about 2 miles along the banks of
the river Don, lies the parish of Forbes.  It contains, by a
late measurement, 4075 acres; of which there are,

-Kearn lies on the N. W. side of the said mountain, on a
very easy declivity to the river Bogie.  As the measurement
of this parish never happened to come into the hands of the
author hereof, he cannot ascertain its extent with precision;
but it is supposed to contain 2716 acres, of which there may
be about 600 under tillage, the rest in pasture, moss and muir,

   Soil and Productions, etc.-The soil throughout the whole
district is naturally light and dry.  This quality renders it
favourable for early harvests.  The crop, however, in dry
seasons, is generally thin and short; but, when refreshed with
frequent showers of rain, it becomes very weighty and luxu-
riant, where the soil is in good heart.  The principal produc-
tions of this district are oats and bear: Some tenants sow a few
pease, but to no great extent.  All of them, however, sow a
few turnips; and plant such quantities of potatoes, greens
and cabbages, as are sufficient for their own consumption.
The district supplies itself with provisions, and sends a consi-
derable quantity to market.
