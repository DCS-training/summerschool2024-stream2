     of Whiteburn.

   Towards the middle of the west end, there is a high ridge
about two and a half miles long, and, in some places, above a
mile broad, of very deep barren moss, part of which, how-
ever, is known to contain a valuable seam of coal; and pre-
parations are now making to have it wrought.  The same
seam of coal has been wrought for above seventy years past,
at Burnhar, in the adjoining parish of Shotts, and still con-
tinues working; having now approached within a few hun-
dred yards of the boundaries of Whiteburn parish.  The
parish is chiefly under tillage; a few black cattle being pas-
tured upon particular spots of almost every farm.

   Climate and Diseases.-The climate is damp and cold,
though not unhealthy.  Rheumatism, flow nervous fevers,
and consumptions, are, perhaps, the most general diseases.
Instances of longevity are not unfrequent.  Several persons,
within the last 50 years, have died upwards of 90; and at
present there are some living between 80 and 90.  The small-
pox is not remarkably mortal here, though inoculation is
extremely little in use.  The few instances, however, where
it has been practised, have been always successful, no person
in the parish recollecting a fatal experiment of this kind;
but still the prejudices of the common people are inveterate
against this salutary practice.

   Rivers.-Almond water runs through the north part of
the parish, and Breich water along the south side of it.  The
canal proposed to be cut between Edinburgh and Glasgow,
must be carried through at least a part of the parish.  The
whole parish is well supplied with good wholesome water,
from springs in almost every quarter of it.
