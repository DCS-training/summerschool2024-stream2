and by drawing the plug, e, the whole earth and water
may be let out at once, while the yams remain in the up-
per apartment quite clean and free of earth; but if not
so well cleaned, or if the earth be hardened about them,
by putting in the plug at bottom, the trough may be fill-
ed again with water, either that the yams may be rinsed
again, or remain covered with the water as long as may
be sufficient to soften the adhering earth, which will then
separate with the birch broom from the yams with great
ease.

   Stacking Grain.-When the corn is cut down, the next
important operation in husbandry is to get it in safe, and to
preserve it found, and also to protect it from plunder by
animals of every description, whether wild or domestic.
The general method of building stacks in this parish is up-
on the ground, and, if the corn be win in the field, no
precaution whatever is thought necessary; so that, although
it be preserved found, it becomes a prey to rats and mice,
and to every animal which can get in to the corn-yard.
A better method is to build the stacks upon what is called
Statholls, which are constructed as under:  A number of
pillars of stone or wood, eight or ten or more, may be pla-
ced in a circular form, according to the diameter of the in-
tended stack, and one in the middle of the circle; all these
are covered with caps of round stones, projecting so far that
no rat or any such animal can get up from the ground; and
the pillars are made about 2 feet high at least, to prevent
geese or turkeys from drawing the corn at bottom.  Upon
these stones, a frame of wood is laid, and from the middle
of this frame a cone of wooden spars is raised, of about 4 or
5 feet diameter at bottom, and ending in a point at about
6 or 8 feet high, according to the height of the stack, of
which the cones must not be higher than the intake at far-
