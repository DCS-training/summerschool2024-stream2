   Hydrography.-- The Loch of the Lowes spreads itself it the
northern boundary of the parish, through which the drain-like
stream which forms the Yarrow makes its way.  This lake is far
inferior to St Mary's, which is only separated from it by a very
narrow neck of land; St Mary's being about three miles long half
a mile broad, and from twenty-eight to thirty fathoms deep, while
the Lowes is only one mile long, a quarter of a mile broad, and
about twelve fathoms in depth.  The Ettrick, on the south side of
a range of hills, called, " the backbone of the country," rises from
among a few rushes between Loch-fell and Capel-fell, two miles
above Potburn, said to be the highest farmhouse above the level

<FOOTNOTE>It is supposed that these elevations of the hills, is taken from the county map,
   are somewhat less their actual height above the level o the sea.
