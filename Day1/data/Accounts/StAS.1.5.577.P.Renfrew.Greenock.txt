   Dry Dock, etc.-The proprietors of the harbour in
1783 began to build a dry dock, which was finished seve-
ral years ago, and is reckoned a very complete piece of
workmanship.  This dock, however, from the yearly in-
crease of shipping, being inadequate to the demand, more
of the same kind have been projected.  An addition to the
harbour, on an extensive plan, including great part of the
bay of Cartidike, was long thought of.  The west part of
it is almost finished.  When the plan is completed, which
it may be in the course of a few years, the harbour of
Greenock, considering the easy navigation of the Clyde,
will be one of the first in Great Britain.

   Trade.-To this short account of its harbour, may be
subjoined a few notes respecting the trade of Greenock*.
Before the Union, the merchants of the town had some
trade to the Baltic for timber, in exchange for herrings;
and to France, Spain and other parts of Europe.  In the
year 1714 a custom-house was establishes at Greenock, as
a member of Port-Glasgow.  From the Union to the be-
ginning of the American war, a very great trade was car-
ried on from Greenock, principally by the Glasgow mer-
chants, who were owners of almost all the ships failing
from that port.  At present, the merchants of Greenock
are the principal ship-holders, and carry on the greatest
part of the trade.

   The following extract from the Custom-house books,
gives a comparative view of the state of the tonnage of
the shipping from that port, in the year 1784, the first year
