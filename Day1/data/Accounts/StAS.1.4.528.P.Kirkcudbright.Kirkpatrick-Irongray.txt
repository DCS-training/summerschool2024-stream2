with any grain whatever.  Two crops of oats are common-
ly taken from the lands at first, the third is potatoes or
peas, and the fourth barley, sown down with rye-grass and
clover, and to enlarge the barley field, the farmers of late,
have fallen upon a method of laying dung upon the oats
stubble, after harvest, and ploughing it down immediately;
which, by a cross ploughing in the spring, and the seed surrow
at last, affords even better crops than the potato land itself.
This is counted an improvement, as barley is a principal
fund for paying rents, which is always faleable in proportion
to the prices that are going at Whitehaven and Liverpool,
which have afforded here for several years past, from 2 s.
to 3 s. the Winchester bushel.  A much greater quantity of
aots is produced also in the parish than is consumed in it;
partly sold in the market of Dumfries, but chiefly made
into meal, and shipped for Greenock and other places.  It
is easy to see that the prices will be different in different
seasons; being from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s. the stone, of 17 1/2 lbs.
according to the demand from other places.  This article of
oat-meal, the general food of the country, cannot be said to
have risen in proportion to provisions of other kinds; the prices
of which are double what they were 40 years ago.-The
number of horses may be about 174, of black cattle 1416,
and of sheep 3080.  The cattle are of a middle size, and
like other Galloways, are known to be excellent feeders;
but as the best of the land is all arable, the farmers com-
monly sell their bullocks before they are old enough to feed
into beef.  Of the sheep , 120 may be of the Mug or Bake-
well kind, and only thrive well upon the good land, the
ewes generally producing two lambs each, which are sold to
the butchers in July, for 8 s. or 9 s. a-piece.  The wool of
these sheep brings about 14 s. or 15 s. the stone, of 24 lb.
while that of the moor sheep is coarse, and sells at about 8 s.
