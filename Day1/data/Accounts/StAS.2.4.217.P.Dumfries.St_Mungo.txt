paupers and 38 dissenters. The last report stated, that rents were
from L.20 to L.80 per annum, now they are from L.50 to L.390.
At the time of last report the want of a bridge over the Milk to
open a colmunication with the Solway Firth was complained of;
the parish roads were also said to be bad; and coal was 20 miles
distant. Now there is a bridge over the Milk, the parish roads
are excellent, and English coal at Annan (only 8 miles distant)
are abundant. At the time of the last report, there were only nine
houses slated; the greater number were built of mud and stones:
only three houses had a parlour and carpet: and hardly an eight-
day clock or silver spoon was seen in the parish. Now there are
only a few old cottages unstated: all the houses built of stone and
lime; ten houses have carpets on the sitting-room; hardly even a
cottage wants an eight-day clock: and every tenant and many cot-
tagers have silver tea-spoons. At last report, the church was a
ruin, without bell, pews, Bibles, or utensils for administering the
sacraments, and the minister officiated occasionally in a shepherd's
plaid; there was no school-house, master, or provision for one;
now everything necessary is provided for the church ; there is an
endowed school, and well-educated schoolmaster; and the minister
is attired in that popish rag, a gown. Formerly the Seceders would
not be present when any Established minister was celebrating any
divine ordinance, and the Episcopal clergy, in terror of the people,
performed the rites of burial in private; the present incumbent
has been sent for, to attend on the sick and dying Seceders, and
the funeral rites of the Episcopal church are performed openly in
our churches and burial grounds.
