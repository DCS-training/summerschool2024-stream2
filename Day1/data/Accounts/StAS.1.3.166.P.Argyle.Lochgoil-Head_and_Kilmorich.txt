cave is remarkable for having been the sanctuary of one of
the lairds of Ardkinglass; who, according to the tradition
of the country, having been defeated and oppressed by some
powerful neighbour, was obliged to conceal himself, and a
few followers, in this cave for a whole year; during which
time his vassals and tenants found means to supply him

small opening, the mouth of which is covered, and concealed

which must be ascended by a ladder; and which leads to a
second apartment, about 15 feet long, 12 feet high, and of
an irregular breadth.  To this place it will be necessary to
bring a candle, or lanthorn, as it is perfectly dark.  From this

which is also dark.  This place is about 24 feet in length, 15
in breadth, and as many in height.  The rocks all around
are covered with petrified water.  The bottom, which is also
rock, is perfectly dry.  Two large rocks meeting cover it a-
