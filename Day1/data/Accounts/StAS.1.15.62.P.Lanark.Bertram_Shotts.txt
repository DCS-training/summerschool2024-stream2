     Statistical Account

Should this prophecy be verified, what a change in the ap-
pearance and product of Shotts may be expected!
   Prices of Labour and Provisions.-An expert ploughman
gets 12 L. Sterling annually; an assistant about 18 years old, 6 L.
Sterling; a herd about 12 years old, through the herding sea-
son, 20 s; a dairy maid, or house servant, annually, 3 L. 16 s.
each of these have bed and board furnished; a day-labourer
from March to November 14 d a-day; the four remaining
months 11 d a-day.  During the harvest season, men receive
14 d. women 10 d. with provisions furnished.  A sailor gets
8 d. with his victuals; a mason and carpenter, each finding
their own provisions, 20 d.  Each of these classes of labourers
have, within these last eight year, risen one third in their de-
mands; at present, however, wages seem rather to be moving
in an opposite direction.-Meal throughout this country
may be rated at 1 1/2 d. a peck below the Glasgow market.  The
great quantities of Merse meal brought from the Dalkeith
market, and carried through this parish to Glasgow, con-
tribute chiefly to produce this effect.  Fresh butter fells at
8 d. a pound; salted butter per stone 12 s; skim'd milk cheese
5 s. 4 d. a stone; butter and cheese weight 22 oz; a hen 14 d;
chickens from 8 d. to 10 d. a pair, eggs 5 d a dozen.  Carriers
picking up and carrying these articles, either to Glasgow or
Edinburgh, heighten their prices very much to thole who
dwell upon the great road.
   Eminent Men.-Shotts has given birth to two persons still
alive of very distinguished merit; viz. GAVIN HAMILTON Esq;
of Murdiston, the most celebrated history painter now in
Europe, and JOHN MILLER, Esq;* professor of law, in the
university of Glasgow, well known to the world by his in-
genious publications.
