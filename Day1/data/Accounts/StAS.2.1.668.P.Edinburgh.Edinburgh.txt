   Roman Catholic Chapel.-This chapel was erected in 1813, in
Broughton Street, corner of York Place. It is of Gothie design,
and cost L. 8000. In it there are 393 let sittings, but the first
morning and the evening services are open to all. The number
of Catholics increasing considerably since this chapel was built,
principally from an influx of Irish families into Edinburgh, an-
other place of worship has been built in Lothian Street, called
St Patrick's. The average of attendance here is 450. There is also
a Catholic Nunnery at St Margaret's, with a private chapel.
This nunnery was established for the education of young ladies
of the Roman Catholic religion. According to the report of the
Bishop to the Church Commission in 1835, the number of "Ca-
tholics" in and about Edinburgh is computed at 12,000 to 14,000.
   Unitarian Chapel.-This chapel is situated in Castle Terrace.
The regular bearers are from 100 to 150.
   The Jeics' Synagogue is situated in Richmond Street.
   In 1835-36 the Parliamentary Church Commission published
a report of the church accommodation in Edinburgh, and returns
of the average number attending the respective places of worship.
The returns are confessedly imperfect, but we subjoin the amount,
in order to exhibit, as nearly as may be, the relative church attend-
ing members of the various denominations.

   Ministers, Widows, Fund.-The originator of this most useful
plan for affording annuities to the widows of Scottish clergymen
and professors of the universities was the Rev. Dr Alexander
Webster, one of the minister of Edinburgh, who was assisted in
his calculations by Dr Wallace, author of the Essay on the Num-
bers of Mankind. The scheme was laid before the General As-
sembly in 1742, and being approved of, received the sanction of
Parliament in 1744, and afterwards its extension and improvement
were ratified by subsequent nots. By this scheme every minister
possessed of a living in the Church of Scotland, and every person
appointed professor in any of its universities, was subjected to the
payment of one of four rates; the lowest of which was L. 2, 12s. 6d.
