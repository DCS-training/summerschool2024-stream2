 The present rental, including the feud, is about L.7000; and
several of the properties have doubled, and some have trebled the
rental in pounds Sterling, corresponding to the original valuation
in Scots money.
 Besides these, there are several other small properties, which
pay a trifling portion of stipend, but are subject to no other pub-
lic burdens.
 Parochial Registers.-The parochial register, containing the
dates of baptisms and marriages, with the contributions and dis-
bursements for the poor, and all the other acts of the kirk-session,
commences 27th July 1604; but in several places it is imperfect,
to 8th November 1691. From that period to the present, the re-
cord is more distinct, and in a more perfect state of preservation,
and contains, for many years, not only the acts and church disci-
pline exercised in the session, but likewise an account of certifi-
cates either granted or received by the session from individuals who
came to reside in the parish. These registers, for the first hun-
dred years, are rather in a dilapidated state and the pages, in se-
veral places, have been misplaced by the binder; but, after that
period, down to the present date, the whole of the books of church
discipline and deaconry, and the register of births and marriages,
are in a state of good preservation. It is much to be regretted
that there is no separate register of deaths and burials.
 Antiquities.-The remains of several mansions which bear the
mark of great antiquity are still to be seen in this parish, such as Cairns
Castle, Murieston Castle, and, till lately, the foundation of an anci-
ent building at Pumpherston. If common report can be relied on,
some of these have been baronial residences, and seem to have
been fortified places in troublesome times. Respecting the old
Castle of Cairos, which consists of a double tower, report would
