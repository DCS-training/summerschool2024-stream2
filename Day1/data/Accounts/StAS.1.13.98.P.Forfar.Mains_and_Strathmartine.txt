mill.  In the east of the parish, are 2 flour-mills, on a
piece of ground feued sometime ago, by the town-council
of Dundee, and commonly called the mills of Baldovan,
and have been long held in tack by the baker corporation
of Dundee.

   Manse, Stipend, Church, School, Poor, etc.-The manse-
was built in X775.  It is a piece of good mason work, but is
too small for the accommodation of a family.  The offices
were built in haste, and have undergone a repair, although
finished only in the end of the year 1775.  The stipend
is 30 bolls of barley, 32 bolls of meal, and L. 26 : 14: 7
in money, including L. 3 for commonion-elements; which
is too small a living for a clergyman, who has a numerous
family.  The teinds are exhausted.  The church was re-
built in 1779.-A new school, and house for the school-
master, were lately built on a small piece of ground, taken
from the church-yard, with the consent of the presbytery.
The schoolmaster's salary is 100 merks Scots, and L. 1, 10 s.
as session-clerk.  The number of scholars in summer is
from 20 to 30, and in winter, from 30 to 40.  The en-
couragement given to schoolmasters in this parish and neigh-
bourhood, being small, they betake themselves to land-
measuring and marl gauging, or commence auctioneers, and
thus the education of youth is neglected:  a remedy for
this evil has long been desired.-The poor are maintained
by the weekly collections, which amount to 2 s. or 3 s.
each Sunday, and by the interest of L. 150.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the
number of souls then was 368.  The following lift of
births, marriages, and deaths, is extracted from the session
records.
