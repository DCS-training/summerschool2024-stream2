entry, the great rise of rent, and the improvement of their
farms, have for some time past had a struggle to fulfil their
engagements; but now their farms begin to answer their own
expectations, and far to exceed the expectations of those a-
mong whom they have settled.  Nor have the old tenants,
with listless apathy, seen the exertions and improvements of
those who have settled among them; they have not only co-
pied, but even tried to excel them in improvement.  Fallow,
wheat, and sown grass have been introduced among the hill
farms.  Lime is now laid on old ley, as well as fallow, with
judgment and success.  The crops of wheat and sown grass
are often considerable, and of good quality.  This new mode of
farming has induced many of them to give up keeping sheep.
Some of the hill farms are very extensive.  Great part of
what is called outfield is steep, and of difficult access, lying
also at a distance from their houses; that ground they are
with great judgment laying out for pasture in parks from a-
bout 4 to 20 acres.  The small feuers in the town of Aber-
nethy, who may have 1, 2, or 3 acres, and not lying all to-
gether, though they cannot conveniently get it fallowed, are
laying on lime, sowing grass, and drilling beans.  Each
farmer raises as much flax as is sufficient for his own family;
little is raised for sale.

   Inclosures, Orchards, etc.-Some farms in the low ground
are inclosed, and subdivided by ditches and thorn hedges.
The farmers, not thinking the ground adapted to pasture, say
the hedges are hurtful, by stopping the free circulation of
air, and hoarding a great number of sparrows, and other
birds, that destroy the grain.  None of the hedges are in a
thriving condition (except those on the estate of Craigpettie),
which is chiefly owing to the little care taken of them.  One
farm at the foot of the hills, containing about 88 acres, fit
