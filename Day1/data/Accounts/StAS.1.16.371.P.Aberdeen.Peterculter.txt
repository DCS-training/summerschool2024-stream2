   Parochial Funds.-Our funds for the support of the poor
consist of the interest of L. 100, the weekly collections in
the church, mortcloth-dues, etc.  The church session have
also in their management annuities paid from the estate of
Culter, amounting to L. 6, or more, and a legacy of L. 40,
the interest of which must be paid to the descendents of one
man and his wife, while they claim it.  The list of poor
contains 30 persons.  They all receive some shillings at
each of three stated times of the year.  They likewise re-
ceive occasional supplies, as necessity requires.  The annual
pension of some does not exceed 12 s.; some get more than
L. 1; and a few of them get more than L. 10 s.  The
distributions, communibus annis, exceed L. 30; some years
they amount to L. 40, with L. 3 or L. 4 to the infirmary
of Aberdeen, over and above.  By the frequent use of
hearses, the income from mortcloths has greatly decreased.
In the year 1782 and 1783 a considerable part of our stock

per distribution of these, by a small share of visual sent by
Government, and by donations from Mrs Udny Duff of
Culter, and Mrs Irvine of Drum, the poor on the roll were
made comfortable, and several persons, who had suffered by
deficient crops, received a seasonable aid.  Two or three
of the poor only go about as mendicants.
   Although there be not at present any gentry who attend
our church, the collection made on Sabbaths does honour
to the charitable spirit of the congregation.

   Alehouses, Morals, etc.-In this parish there are three
houses where ale and spiritous liquors are sold.  Forty
years back there were four times that number, and ine-
