The water of Falloch, which rises and falls into Loch Lomond a
its head,-of Inveruglass, which runs into Loch Lomond at Up
per Inveruglass,-of Douglass, which enters the same at Lowe
Inveruglass, with the water of Linnhe that flows into the head o
Loch Long,-are not remarkable for either lenoth, depth, or
breadth. There are several small but beautiful cascades in the
parish.
   Geology and Mineralogy.-Except where in one or two places it
is traversed by a whin dike, mica slate is the only rock formation of
ttieparish,-extending from the sea level to the summit of the high-
est hills; the schistose laminae are usually in parallel layers; but
the section made by the new road along Loch Lomond to the
foot of Glen Falloch presents them in every variety of contortion.
Nor can there be any where a better field for studyii)g the pecu-
liarities of this primary rock so prevalent in the mountainous re-
gions of our country. So far as we are able to judge, there are
DO iDdications of minerals, iron excepted; and these are but few
and not very distinctly marked.
   Zooloqy.-White hares and ptarmigan are to be met with on
Ben Vorlicb. Several of the farms rear sheep of excellent quali-
ty. In Loch Lomond, salmon, salmon-trout, pike, perch, powans,
usually called freshwater herrings, and eels, are to be met with.
In Loch Long, there are salmon, salmon-trout, cod, setbe, lythe,
ling, wbitings, skate, halibut, flounders, soles, with herrings in their
seasons, and almost all the varieties of white fish. Muscles are
found in great abundance towards the head of Loch Long, oysters
but in small quantities, limpets, wilks, buckies, spout-fisb; but
crab-fish or partans are seldom met with, in any degree of per-
fection.
    Caterpillars are occasionally troublesome in gardens, and several
years ago they attacked, in immense numbers, and with great vo-
racity, the oak woods; and in many places the fghage was utterly
destroyed.
