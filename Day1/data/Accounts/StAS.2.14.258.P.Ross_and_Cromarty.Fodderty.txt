      west, he should die.  The person still lives.  Such are some of the
      superstitious notions which prevail in districts of the parish, at the

                           V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
         Ecclesiastical State.-The church of the parish was built in 1807,
      and is situated witbin a mile of the pump-room.  It was originally in-
      tended to accommodate 400, but the heritors voluntarily agreed to
      enlarge it to the extent of about 200 additional sittings.  This was
      done at considerable expense, three years ago.  It is still, however,
      far from sufficient to supply the wants of the parish, and is very in-
      conveniently situated for those who dwell on the south side of Knock-
      Farril, amounting to between 800 and 900, who in winter are often
      prevented from attending church by the steepness of the hill,
      and the depth of snow which at times lies upon it.  There are full
      services, every Lord's day, both in Gaelic and Englisb.  There
      are no Dissenting or Seceding families in the parish.
         The manse was built in 1794, and is in excellent repair.  It is
      surrounded with a glebe and garden, containing upwards of ten
      acres, the soil of which is, upon the whole, good.  The stipend, by
      the last augmentation, obtained in 1824, is 16 chalders, partly
      money, and partly victual, exclusive of the legal allowance of
      L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements.  The Honourable Mrs Hay
      M'Kenzie of Cromartie is patroness.
         Mr Hector M'Kenzie, the first Presbyterian minister of the pa-
      rish, was inducted in 1728.  He was succeeded by Mr Colin
      M'Kenzie in 1734, who died in 1801, at the advanced age of ninety-
