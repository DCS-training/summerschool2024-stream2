   Population, etc.-According to Dr Webster, the num-
ber of souls, about 40 years ago, was 500.  The amount
at present is, by actual enumeration, 207 males, and 223
females; total 430.  At an average of 20 years, from 1731
to 1751, there have been 16 births yearly; but from
1770 to 1790, 11 baptisms only appear from the records;
and from 1785 to 1790, only 4 marriages yearly.
   The inhabitants are in general healthy, and live to a
considerable age; some to 80, and even 90 years, but few
beyond that period.  Nor have there been any murders or
suicides, or any banishments; and but very few emigra-
tions.  Neither have any died from want, to my know-
ledge, in the parish.
   The proportion between the births and whole popula-
tion, is as 1 to 40 nearly; between the marriages and po-
pulation, as 1 to 107; and each marriage, at an average,
produces about 4 children.  The number of heritors is 4,
none of whom reside.  There are 7 Seceders, and 4 Epis-
copalians.

   Agriculture, etc.-The farms are generally small, from
L. 5 to L. 6 Sterling yearly rent, and uninclosed.  Nor
are the farmers convinced of the advantages of inclosures.
The rent of the best arable ground, is from 18 s. to 20 s.
each acre; and the worst, from 8 s. to 10 s. the acre.
There are in the parish, about 34 ploughs of arable ground,
and 24 carts.  The old Scotch plough is generally used as
most proper for stiff and stony ground.  We generally sow
in the months of March and April, and reap in September
and October; and the parish does, for the most part, sup-
ply itself with provisions.  Our exports are very trifling;
