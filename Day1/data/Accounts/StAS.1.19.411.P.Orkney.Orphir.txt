to the ill-judged preference given to the linen-manufacture,

   Number of Acres.-There is no map of the parish; but
as the ploughgangs are much of a size, each containing
about 8 acres of arable ground at an average, and the pas-

may equal a ploughgoing, then, 17X8=936 acres of arable,
and 936X2=1872 acres of pasture; and the whole parish
being computed to contain 20 square miles, or 12800 acres,
then there remain for mosses, braiks, lakes, and hill-pasture,
9992 acres.  The arable being to the whole surface as 1

Sueno; Orphir, the land of Fire; and Claistran, Close
Town, from being the westermost extremity of the parish,

neighbouring parish has a similar name, viz. Clouston, as if
the original measurer of these parishes, in laying out their
different districts, had proceeded from E. to W. from a su-
perstitious respect to the fun's course.  There are many
other local names, evidently of similar origin; such as,
Voeness, a headland dividing two small bays; Heildibrae,
a place where bonefires used to be kindled, from the Ice-
