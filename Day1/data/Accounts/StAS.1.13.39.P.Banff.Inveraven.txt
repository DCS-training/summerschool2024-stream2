30 and 40 scholars, but in the summer season the number
amounts only to 12, and rarely to 20.  In Glenlivet, there is
one of the Society's schools, which is ambulatory between
Deskie and Badavochle, being stationed sometimes at the one
place, and sometimes at the other.  The former-master of
this Society school had L. 22 Sterling from the Society;
but the present has only L. 15 Sterling, which is really too
little in Glenlivet.  In the winter season he may have
sometimes 90 scholars, but in the summer time they often
do not exceed 20.-The inrolled poor in the parish, are
38 Protestants and 29 Papists, in all 67 persons.  The Ro-
man Catholics, as they have their own collections made in
the mass-house, get no part of the collections gathered
up in the church and meeting-house; but they get a
share of the interest of the mortified money.  About 15
years ago, there was L. 100 Sterling, which the kirk-session
sent out on interest; and as neither of the two heritors
would accept of it, they were obliged to lend it to such per-
sons as they thought good and sufficient, and would take it.
Accordingly, they lent about L. 61 Sterling to one landed
gentleman, and about L.35 Sterling to another, who
were both thought good and sufficient when they received
the money; but, in a few years afterward, both of them
became bankrupts; whereby not only several years interest
was lost, but also half the principal.  The collections in both
church and meeting-house, amount annually only to about
L. 6 or L. 7 Sterling:  Therefore, as the collections a-
mount to so small a sum, and no assessment is laid upon the
parish for their support, the poor are often obliged to travel
and seek their maintenance.

all of the same kind.  In the lower part of the parish, the
