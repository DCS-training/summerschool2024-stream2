supported by imported grain from the end of February;
and that more than 800 souls will stand in need of assist-
ance from the poors funds, (supposing they were sufficient
for that purpose), before they can be supplied from the
crop upon the ground, which cannot be expected sooner
than three months hence."  Upon this report, the Barons
of Exchequer, sent in all, 79 bolls of meal, at different
times, to be distributed gratis, and 102 1/2 bolls, to be sold
at 8 s. 8 d. the boll.  This was a great relief.  Lord Fife al-
so sold out the meal in his girnel, and what multure farm
came in, at 16 s. Sterling the boll; and he deducted a fifth
part of the tenants money-rent for 1783, upon condition,
that they paid up the remainder, together with the arrears
of the former rent, and the price of their deficient farm or
victual rent, by the 1st of February 1784; but many of
them were rendered unable to take the benefit of his Lord-
ship's liberality*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Here follows a statement of the amount, and disposal of the poors
funds, for three different periods, viz for 4 years preceding I783; du-
ring 1783 and 1784; and for 4 years immediately preceding the date of
this report.
