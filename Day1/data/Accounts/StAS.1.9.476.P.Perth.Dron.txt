to the old practice of encouraging these little plantations of
useful and industrious labourers.  By the suppression of
these, it may likewise be observed, a number of people,
who, from their manner of life and employment in the
country, were a healthy vigorous race, have been, for the
present force to seek a subsistence in the neighbouring
