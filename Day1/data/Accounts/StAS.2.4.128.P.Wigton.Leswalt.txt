128			WIGTONSHIRE.

preaching station in the suburb adjoining to Stranraer, where a
district church is about to be erected. The church is well at-
tended, and the number of communicants about 400. The
church collections and other donations average about L. 40 an-
nually.
	The number of families attending the established Church is
411; of families attending chapels of Dissenters or Seceders, 111;
of Roman Catholic families, 17.
	Education.--There are, at present, four schools in the parish,
the parochial and three private. The parochial schoolmaster has
the minimum salary, a house and garden, and the school fees,--
the amount of which I cannot ascertain. There are no children
in the parish so distant but they may attent some of the schools;
and there are none belonging to the parish who cannot both read
and write, as the parents, in general, seem anxious to have their
children educated. About 200 children attend the sabbath even-
ing schools.
	Library.--There is a parochial library, which contains nearly
400 volumes, and the people have a taste for reading.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The average number of poor re-
ceiving aid is about 60, eleven of whom receive on an average per
annum, L. 6. The rest of the paupers receive parochial aid from
the church collections, which amount to betwixt L. 50 and L. 60.
There are no legal assessments: but contributions are voluntarily
made by the heritors. The poor have also the interest of L. 200
left by the late Earl of Stair. The greater part of the poor, be-
ing Irish, are very frequent and importunate in teir demands.
	Inns.--There are six inns or ale-house in the parish.
	Fuel.--Both coal and turf are used as fuel in the parish. A
cart load of turf costs 2s.; coals, 15s. per ton.
