It is to be observed, that the kelp shores are set
  in tack with four of the principal farms in
  the isle of Sanday, which four farms may
  make about 130 tons or more of kelp; and
  as the rock rent for a ton of kelp is usually
  about 1 l. 5 s. Sterling, we should discount
  this, in order to ascertain the rent paid for
  the land only.  Deduct then for 130 tons
  kelp at 25 s. per ton, say                         162  10  0
                                                    -----------
