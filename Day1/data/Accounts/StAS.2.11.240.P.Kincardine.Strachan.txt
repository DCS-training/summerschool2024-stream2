   Bridges.--The bridges are in good repair, but considerable
inconvenience is felt from the loss of one by the great flood of
1829, on the line of road across the cairn. A temporary wooden
bridge supplies its place at Whitestone, about a mile above the
spot where it stood.
   Ecclesiastical State.--The parish church was built about forty years
ago. In 1937, it was comfortably repaired and an additional gallery
erected. It accommodates with ease 488 persons, and all the sittings
are free. It is situated near the centre of that part of the val-
ley which is included in the parish, on the north bank of the river
Feugh, and the site is the most suitable which could have been
chosen for the general convenience of the parishioners. Except-
ing Glen Dye, where there is a population of 150, distant from
four to six miles, all the rest of the parishioners are within a con-
venient distance from the church, the extremes being not more
than three miles distant.
   The manse was built in 1777, and repaired and enlarged in
1828. It is ample and comfortable. The whole extent of grounds
attached to the manse is about five and a half acres, of which
nearly four acres are arable, and the remainder in garden, green,
roads, and stance of houses.
   The glebe land is worth L.2 per acre. Stipend payable from
the lands of Blackhall, by Colonel Campbell, L. 20, 10s. 0 5/10d.;

ing L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements), and 1 boll, 2 firlots,

   The whole of the population belong to the Established Church,
with the exception of one family of Roman Catholics, four in
number; one of Independents, three in number; and the families
of the proprietors of Blackball and Invery, who are Episcopalians.
   There is divine service in the church, twice on the Sabbath,
during five months in summer, at eleven o'clock forenoon, and
half-past four in the afternoon, and in the forenoon only during
the remaining months of the year. In the forenoon, the church
is generally full, and from 150 to 200 attend in the afternoon.
Sir James, Carnegie erected, about three years since, at an ex-
pense of from L.150 to L.200 a handsome school-room and
school-house, in Glendye, about four miles from the manse. The
