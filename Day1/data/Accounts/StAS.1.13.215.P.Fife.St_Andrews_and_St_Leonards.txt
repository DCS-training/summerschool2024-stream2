King, as succeding to the archbishop, and the corporation 
of the city, bearing the other two thirds.  This expense
of the church, and also that of the stipend, falls light on a 
valued rent, which exceeds L. 24,000 Scotch.  The disad-
vantage of the harbour is, that it lies in a rocky shore, at 
the S. W. corner of a deep bay, very much exposed to all
winds from E. and N.  The access to the port, therefore,
is often very difficult, and the departure precarious.-The 
language of this parish is the common dialect of the Scotch
Lowlands.  The Fifans are said, by strangers, to use a
drawling pronunciation, but they have very few pronvincial
words.  Very many of the names of places in the parish,
are evidently modern and vernacular, Denhead, Edinside,
Northbauk, Bylone, Smiddygreen, Stonywind, Boarhills, 
Brownhills, etc.  Several places retain the ancient Gaelic
names, Balrymont, Kinglaffie, Kingask, Kincaple, Strath-
kinness, Balmungo, etc.  Kincaple, about 3 miles W. from
St Andrew's near the road to Dundee, Strathkinnness a 
short mile S. from Kincaple, on the old road to Cupar, and 
Boarhills, between 3 and 4 miles E. from St Andrew's, 
may be reckoned villages:  in these, besides farmers and 
cottagers, you find alehouses, blacksmiths, wrights, weavers,
tailors, shoemakers.-On 8th February 1792, in digging a 
garden belonging to David Roger , staymaker, in the street 
leading to Cardinal Bethune's castle, called the Castle-wynd 
a small pot was turned up, which seemed to be full of earth,
but being immediately dashed in pieces, there dropped out
8 gold coins, and about 150 silver ones.  The gold was
clean, though the colour pale.  The silver pieces were co-
vered with thick rust, and many of them perfectly friable *.
