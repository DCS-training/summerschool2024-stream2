pious intended their liberal bequests, is an object of such
importance, that it were to be wished matters could be set-
tled on a more favourable sooting.  It is hard indeed, that if
a poor ignorant set of people, in an obscure corners, have the
misfortune to be under a niggardly or a poor proprietor, that

brethren intended them.  The 3 d district of Lochbroom
might comprehend Little Strath, Strathnasailg, the Laich, etc.
and would also stand in need of a mission.  It contains about
880 souls.  The 4th, and the last district, might comprehend
the rest of this parish, viz. Meikle Strath, and other places
contiguous to the parish church, which consist of about 950
souls.

this parish, may be seen two large coves, one on the north
side of the island, and the other on the south.  That on the
north would be sufficiently large for 50 men, either to fit or
lie down in.  It is said to have been inhabited by a Popish
priest, who used to shift his quarters from one cove to ano-
ther, as the weather directed.  It still retains the name of
Priest Island.
