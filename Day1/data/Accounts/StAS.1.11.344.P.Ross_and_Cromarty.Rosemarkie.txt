present manse was built in 1756, on a rising ground, directly

church stands about a quarter of a mile distant, in the town
of Rosemarkie, on a dry bank of sand, near the sea shore.
It was built upon the old plan, uncommonly long and narrow,
which is very disagreeable to the preacher; but when the
present roof fails, it is hoped the heritors will have it re-
built, in a more proper and commodious form.

above 200 L., laid out at interest, with, some of in

croach upon their capital, for,the subsistence, not only of their
ordinary poor, but of many other families, then reduced to
very straitened circumstances.  Besides this, there are two
