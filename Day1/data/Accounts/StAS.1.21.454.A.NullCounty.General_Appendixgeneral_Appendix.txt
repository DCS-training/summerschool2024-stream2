lature, to suppose that they intended any thing under the
real value of the merks; and this value is best ascertained
by turning them into grain.  Now, I do not find that Par-
liament had altered the legal conversion when they passed the
above act.  From 1561 to 1633, mad thereafter, the hun-
dred merks was equivalent to a chalder, in the acts of Parlia-
ment:  we must therefore be of opinion, that the parochial
salaries were intended to be equivalent to from one to two
chalders.  This was doubtless what the legislature proposed
for them.  But, unfortunately their salaries were all modified
in money, which has fallen in value out of all proportion:
and if this had been adverted to, or foreseen, by those who
framed the Act of Endowment, it is not merely probable,
but morally certain, that they would have ordered the sala-
ries in grain, and not money.  May it not be asked, What
should hinder an explanatory act, to this purpose, still?  A
chalder for every hundred merks salary, which our parochial
teachers now possess, would restore them, so far as the salary
goes, to the enjoyment of those livings, which the Revolution
gave, by statute, to their predecessors.  It would also restore
the wholesome spirit of that law; do justice to a useful order
of men, and, through them, to society at large; and contri-
bate essentially to the improvement of youth in found morals,
and in that sort of learning which is both useful and orna-
mental.
   It would then be necessary, only, to regulate the fees of
teaching; and a similar rule would determine this also.  They
ought to be augmented as money falls in value:  which would
prevent learning from being undervalued, encourage the
teacher to at assiduity and stimulate parents and youth to make
the most of their time; a real service to all concerned.
   It is nonsense to propose getting solid learning at the ge-
nerality of our parochial schools, at present.  The privilege
