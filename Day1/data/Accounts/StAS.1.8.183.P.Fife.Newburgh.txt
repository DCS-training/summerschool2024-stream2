parts of Fife, were shipped at the shore of Newburgh, and
fold to the farmers in the Carse of Gowrie, for manure.  But
the lime works erected on the Frith of Forth, and on the
English coast, from which the farmers, in the east end of
Strathearn, and in the Carse of Gowrie, are more readily and
more cheaply supplied, have nearly put an end to that species
of traffic.  For several years past, great quantities of wheat
and barley, purchased from the farmers in the neighhourhood,
have been shipped at the shore of Newburgh, chiefly for the
Edinburgh and Glasgow markets.  This trade seems likely
to continue; and while it brings advantage to Newburgh,
must operate to the benefit of the country at large.  On the
north side of Fife, more grain is cultivated, than can be con-
sumed by the inhabitants.  Formerly, a market was, with
difficulty, found for the surplus; but, by the connexion estab-
lishing between Fife and the south country, this difficulty
will be removed, and a new spur given to the farther cultiva-
tion of a district lately much improved, but capable of being
rendered greatly more productive.

   Farms.-There are only 4 farms in this parish, the remain-
ing lands, which are not extensive, either continuing in the
possession of the proprietors themselves, or being divided into
inconsidrable portions among a variety of feuars, tenants,
burghal heritors, and other small proprietors.  Of there farms,
however, it may be with truth, affirmed, that they are at pre-
sent, in as good a slate of cultivation, as any in the neigh-
bourhood.  Few farms, in the whole extent of the Ochil
Hills, to the westward, have been more judiciously laid out,
than two of them, which occupy the estate of Pitcairly; and
no farm in the Carse of Gowrie can be kept in higher order,
or rendered more productive, than the one which is connected
with the Abbey of Lindores.  The fourth farm, although
