are liable, which ought to be guarded against, viz. permitting

   Charitable Foundation.-JAMES SCHAW, proprietor of the
estate of Preston, bequeathed the lands and barony of Pres-
ton, with the residue of some other funds, for maintaining
and educating boys, whose parents are in poor circumstances.
He died A.D. 1784.  The house of Preston was, according
to the terms of the deed, fitted up for the reception of the
boys; and the establishment commenced in February 1789.
There is a master, house-keeper, and two maid servants.  At
first 15 boys were admitted.  The number was afterwards
increased to 24.  Two have died.  They are taught English,
writing, and arithmetic; and, as they grow up, some manual
employment, viz. to knit stockings; to mend their clothes
and shoes, etc.  Four names have a preference, in the fol-
lowing order: Schaw, Macneil, Cuningham, and Stewart.  The
age of admission is from 4 to 7.  They may remain in the
house till they are 14.  They must be free from the King's
evil, and from all contagious distempers.  The trustees are
empowered to bind them as apprentices, or otherwise to set
them out to business, as they shall judge best.
