ploughed in spring, and sown with oats or barley, as the farmer thinks
the soil adapted. By this method the farm will be divided thus:one-
sixth in green crop; one-third in grass; one-half in corn. Lime has
been in use here for thirty years, and is still now and then repeated
when the land is in process of cleaning with green crop.
Stock- There are about 120 or 130 work horses. They are not
heavy, but generally active. Two make an excellent plough. Breed-
ing them to any extent for sale is not practised, as the lands are
generally open fields; but most farmers endeavour to rear as many
as supply themselves.
   There are about 650 black-cattle. The breed is a cross be-
tween the Highland and Aberdeenshire. They are very handsome
stock when in good condition. A very small proportion of what is for
yearly sale is fed off for the butcher. These when three or four years
old weigh from twenty-eight to thirty-six stone. The greater part
is sold when two or three years old to the graziers in Aberdeenshire,
and other counties to the south. The dairy is not much practis-
ed. The largest farm skeep from eight to twelve cows. They bring up
their calves, and serve the family. The farmer is more careful to
have neat figures for breeding than to have them good for milk-
ing. There are few sheep. Three or four flocks of about one
hundred each are kept. Most of the farmers close upon the Spey
keep from four to eight pasturing among their cattle. The breed,
is a cross between the Cheviot and the small brown-faced Moray-
shire.
   Navigation- Notwithstanding the disadvantages connected with
the harbour of Garmoutb, it is gratifying to know that, compared
with what it was in 17921 the trade and shipping of the port has
greatly increased. 11ave no means of ascertaining the number of
vessels which entered here during any year from 1792 till 1816.
From 1st January 1816 till 31st December 11825, a period of ten
years, 1863 vessels besides boats sailed, three-fourtho of which at
least werd loaded with timber and grain. This gives an average of
186 yearly. The followin , is the number of vessels which arrived
and sailed for the seven years from the 5th January 1826 to 5th
January 1833, as per Custom-house books.
