Climate and Diseases.--The climate is moist and variable, as
might be expected, in consequence of much of the country being
elevated, marshy, and uncultivated. The prevailing wind is south-
west. In spring we have cold easterly. The writer of this sketch
kept a register of the quantity of rain that fell in the years 1834,
1835, 1836, 1837. The instrument employed was constructed
by Mr Thorn of Rothsay, and is similar to many which are now
in use in the west country. The following are the monthly regis-
trations, by which it will be seen that this parish has fully its own
share of rain:-

The diseases most prevalent in the parish are, rheumatism, con-
tinued fever, and inflammatory complaints. Typhus fever has in-
creased greatly, of late years. Cholera did not visit us in its
destructive course in 1834; but scarcely a family escaped the in-
fluenza of 1837, though there were comparatively few deaths.
   Hydrography.--Tbere are no lakes in the parish. The prin,
cipal rivers are the Duchray, the Forth, and the Endrick. The
Duchray, which is the southern and most considerable branch of
the Forth, rises near the summit of Benlomond, and forms the
northern boundary of the parish for some miles. It then leaves it
to the south, and after joining the branch from Loch Ard, and
acquiring the name of Forth, it approaches and again skirts the
parish as far as its eastern extremity. The Forth, in this part of
its course, is an uninteresting stream, its dark waters winding with a
sluggish current between deep banks of moss, without any object
that contributes to picturesque beauty. The Endrick intersects
the parish for nearly two. miles, and bounds it for about two more.
It has its source among the Gargunnock Hills, to the north-east
of Fintry, and, aftera course of eighteen miles in nearly a direct
line, empties itself into Lochlomond, being the largest river which
that lake receives. It is a clear rapid stream, and (as its Celtic
name * is said to imply) very subject to sudden floods, which often
do considerable damage. In September 1836, it rose fearfully in
the course of one night, and swept twenty score of lambs from the
lawn Of Buchanan into Lochlomond. On this river, at Gartness,
