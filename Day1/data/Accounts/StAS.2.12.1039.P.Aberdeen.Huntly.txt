parish church, erected in 1805, and seated for 1800 ; the new
church, built in 1840, and seated for 945, which cost, without Go-
vernment drawback, upwards of L.1300; the Roman Catholic
chapel, which is surmounted by a curious rather than a handsome
tower, the top of it appearing in the shape of a crown, built in 1834,
and seated for 350,--which cost, with the priest's house, L. 1660, of
which L.1000 was paid by Gordon of Wardhouse; the Indepen-
dent chapel, built in 1802, with 500 sittings; the Secession church

      			     III.--POPULATION.

       	According to the Parliamentary returns, the population of the
whole parish was,
                           In 1801,         2863
                              1831,         3545
                              1841,         3642

       	Taking the whole population at 3700, which, from the writer's
own statistical notes, he believes  at present to be nearly correct,
the following will be found to be about the proportions in the re-
spective districts, viz.--In the Dumbenuan country district, 90
families to a population of 408, equal to 4.53 in each family; in
the Kinoir country district, 93 fimilies to a population of 422,
equal to nearly 4.54 in each family; in the town of Huntly, 804
families to a population of 2870, equal to nearly 3.51 in each family.
    	The small proportion of individuals in each family in the town
compared with the country, arises from the large number of single
women, who, when disabled from active employment by age or
other causes, generally find their way into the town from the whole
surrounding district of country, and live in separate places by them-
selves.  And it may also be mentioned here, that, in 1831, the
population of the town of Huntly was 2585, leaving 960 for the
country; the diminution in this portion having arisen from the
breaking up of a number of the smaller farms at the last lease let-
ting.  As a specimen of the number of children in each family,
in a district of the town containing 242 families,--excluding the
families of bachelors and single women where there are no child-
ren, but reckoning every family where there are any children or a
married couple,--there were found 542 children, giving 2 1/4 to each.
