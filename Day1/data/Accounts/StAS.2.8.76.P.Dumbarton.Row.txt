                      III.--POPULATION.

  In consequence of the very meagre and imperfect records of
the parsh, there are no means of ascertaining the population at
remote and regular dates. In the former Statistical Account
of the parish, it is said, that the number of inhabitants was 853;
but it is not stated at what period this census was taken. About
ninety years ago the number amounted to 1300, and about fifty
years before this present date, it appears to have fallen to 1000.
There can be little doubt that this decrease of 300 was owing to
the enlargement of the farms and the ousting of cottars. In the
Glenfruin district alone it is almost within the memory of indivi-
duals still alive, that there were 45 families of farmers, besides
a number of cottars; now there are only 10 of farmers and 4 of
cottars.In consequence, however, of the very rapid growth of
the town of Helensburgh, the population doubled itself within
the last forty years previous to 1831. It was in that year 2037.
From 1831 till 1835, there was an additional increase of about
400, chiefly from the still greater growth of Helensburgh ; though
partly also from the building of villas and cottages on the Gareloch.
The present population may amount to about 2600. Of this num-
ber the burgh of Helensburgh contains 1400; the remainder are
Scattered over the landward part of the parish, and can scarcely be
said to be in any part of it, a village population, unless indeed the
few houses in the neighbourhood of the church of Row, and the
increasing clump of cottages at Gareloch-head, may be called vil-
lages.
    The average number of births may be about,	-     -     50
    The average of deaths, -   -    -              between 40 and 50
    The number of marriages,        -   -    -                    24
