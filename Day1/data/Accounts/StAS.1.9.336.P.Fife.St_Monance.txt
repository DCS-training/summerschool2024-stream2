ironstone lying scattered upon the surface.  It yields a good
deal of sea-weed for kelp, which i usually cut every third
year, and after gales of wind from the N. E. E. and S. E.
a good quantity for manure.

   Climate, etc.-The climate is mild and temperate, the
air dry and salubrious.  But when it blows from the E. and
S. E. it is sharp and cold, moist, and full of last par-
ticles; for the land is much exposed to the sea on these
quarters, and not covered with trees; which if it were, the
air would not only be more mild, the surface greatly beau-
tified, but the ground more early in its productions, which
are much checked in the spring by the winds from these
points, and which commonly blow for a long time at that
season.  Yet upon the whole, the inhabitants in general are

longevity during the incumbency of the present minister.
But there are many now living of 70, 76, and 80 years, and
some died a few years ago, at the age of 90 and 91.  The

especially in the town of St Monance.  If the contagion
got in during the heat of summer, when the air is much
tainted with the refuse of the fishing, it was then peculiarly
fatal, sweeping off from 20 to 30 children at a time.  But
its destructive progress has for several years past been in some
degree mitigated, by that happy invention, inoculation; and
to which the people in general are now becoming more and

   Rivers.-There are no rivers, but one small brook, which
bounds the parish on the W. runs S. intersecting part of the
lands of Newark, and empties itself, between the church
and town of St Monance, into the frith of Forth.  There
is another in the lands of Abercrombie, which bounds the
