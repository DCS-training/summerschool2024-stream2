which is at 3 years old, and they then bring from L. 5 to L. 6
each.
   Besides the milk cows or native stock, a considerable num-
ber of highland cows are fattened upon each farm.  These
are commonly bought in at the Michaelmass and Martinmass
markets, and wintered upon the farm, with the assistance of
a little fodder, from New-year's-day, till the middle of April.
They are then fed during the following summer, and sold to
the Glasgow and Paisley markets in autumn.  At the time
they are sold, they generally weigh from 18 to 24 stones of
beef and tallow, which brings, at an average, 6 s per stone.
   The sheep stock consists of ewes, which are all of the short
or black faced kind; which the farmers have taken conside-
rable care to improve, by selecting the best rams, and supply-
ing the defect of their stock, with the best and stoutest ewe
lambs.  In addition to this, they also buy in from time to
time, good lambs from those parts of the country which are
samed for keeping good stocks of sheep.  The profits arising
from the sheep stock, are chiefly derived from the wool and
lambs.  The smeared wool sells at 6 s per stone, and white
wool from 8 s to 9 s.  The lambs bring at an average 6 s each.
A few of the worst ewes called shotts, are likewise sold every
year about Martinmass.
   The ewes are so managed, as to begin to produce their
lambs about the 10 th of April; the most proper season on
high grounds.  It sometimes happens, that a number of them
have twins.  When that is the case, the ewes are brought
down to the low grounds, where the rich pasture enables
them to nurse both.  If any ewe happens to lose her lamb,
she is confined in a house, with a twin lamb taken from ano-
ther, for two nights; by which time, she becomes attached
to it, and nurses it as her own.  In the latter end of July,
the lambs are weaned; when those selected for keeping up
