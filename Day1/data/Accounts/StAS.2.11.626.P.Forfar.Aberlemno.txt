                       PARISH OF ABERLEMNO.

          PRESBYTERY OF FORFAR, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

	     THE REV. JOHN CROMBIE D. D., MINISTER.

              I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Boundaries, &c.-ABERLEMNO is bounded on the north by the
parishes of Tannadice and Caraldstone, from which it is separated
by the river Esk; on the north-east and east, by Brechin; on the
south-east, by Guthrie; and on the south and west, by Rescobie.
The small river Lemno, from which the parish derives its named,
has its origin in a spring near the house of Carsegownie, (a farm
towards the western extremity of the parish,) and which, after flow-
ing a few miles in a south-westerly direction, and winding towards
the north, around the western extremity of the hill of Oathlaw,
takes then an easterly course, and falls into the Esk, near the ruins
of the ancient castle of Finhaven, and little more than a mile from
its source. As Aberlemno signifies at the mouth of the Lemno, the
name is somewhat inapplicable, inasmuch as the nearest boundary
of the parish is almost half a mile distant from the estuary of the
Lemno. It appears, however, that a portion of the estate of Finha-
ven, adjacent to the south bank of the Lemno, and now annexed to
the parish of Oathlaw, was once a part of this parish. The outline
of an ancient church, close to the mouth of the Lemno, is still visible,
which was probably the original church of Aberlemno, although
tradition expeesses a doubt whether it may not have been a chapel
attached to the neighbouring castle of Finhaven, once a strong-
bond of the Lindesays.
