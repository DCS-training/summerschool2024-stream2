in general, they keep two, or more horses, and from 8 to 12, and
some of them 20 black cattle.  There are only four or five of
them that have a flock of sheep, if a hundred sheep, the great-
est number any of them keep, is entitled to that appellation.
Could the farmers in the higher grounds of this district main-
tain their cattle during the winter and spring months, with-
out the aid of oat-straw, it would be their interest to cultivate
only grass crops, potatoes, and turnip, with some flax for
their respective families; but though they have many natural
meadows in their possession, yet the grass obtained from them
is coarse, and the quantity too small for that purpose.  They
make up much of their rents by rearing young cattle, and sel-

as this parish marches for a considerable tract of country with
Dunlop, so famous for making cheese, the soil, and quality of
the grass, cannot be greatly different.  They sow from the
middle of March to the end of April, and seldom reap soon-
er than the end of September, with the exception of a few
farms that may be more early.  Considerable part of the crop
has, of late years, been often in the fields at the end of Oc-
tober, in stooks and huts.

cess, stipend, road-money, school-master's salary, etc.
   Some farms let from 15 to 25 s; and land in the immediate
neighbourhood of the villages at L. 2, may, some above that
sum; not that the land is worth that price, but people will do
much, sometimes, for convenience, at other times from neces-
sity.  Houses in the village of Nielston let at L. 1: 10 to
