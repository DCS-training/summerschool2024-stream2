their numbers for many years past have been greatly diminished
Various causes have been assigned for this, such as the exten-
sion of the fisheries below Glasgow-the constant plying of steam-
boats on the river-the impurities and noxious substances that are
carried into its waters from the dye-works on its banks, and the
factories in the neighbourhood, and, above all, the impediment which
is presented to their progress up the river by the dam thrown over
it between Blantyre Mill and Bothwell.  The fish are seen in great
numbers during the spawning season (from September to Decem-
ber) struggling to get over this obstruction.  As many as 150 leaps
have been counted within fifteen minutes ; the attempt is rarely
successful.
