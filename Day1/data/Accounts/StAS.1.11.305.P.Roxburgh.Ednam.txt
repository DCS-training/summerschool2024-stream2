arable and pasture land, and inferior prices according to
the quality.

   Cattle and Fuel.-The farmers consider the land as too good
for breeding cattle or sheep, and therefore few are reared in
the parish: The sheep and cattle are mostly all bought in, and
fed for the butcher to great value.  Fuel is very expensive, as
there are no coals, but what are brought from Northumber-
land, at the distance of 16 or 18 miles.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants has increased con-
siderably within these 40 years.
