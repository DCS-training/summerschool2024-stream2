the eastward of the village of Beauly), in a direction pretty 
nearly from east to west, till within a short distance of the
Cro of Kintail; a tract of ground upwards of 60 miles in
length, by 10, 20, and even 30, in some places, in breadth.
On the south, it is bounded by the Frith of Beauly, the pa-
