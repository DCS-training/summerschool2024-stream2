     Geography and Natural History.

   LHANBRYD, signifying in the original, "St Bridget's
Church," was united to St Andrew's, to which last,
two other chapels had also been joined before the Reforma-
tion.  This parish measures about 3 English miles from
W. to E. along the highway from Elgin to Spey; and
from S. to N. about 4, exclusive of an improvement in the
hill 1 mile distant, on the S. disjoined by an intervening
skirt of the parish of Elgin, to which it pertains.  It was
originally the moor where the cattle were collected for
drawing part of the teinds of both parishes, before they
were converted into money, from which it retains the name
of Teindland; and on account of its distance from Elgin, the
inhabitants have in general ranked themselves in this parish.
The general appearance of the country is a plain, in which
several low hills rise, so arranged as to appear connected
