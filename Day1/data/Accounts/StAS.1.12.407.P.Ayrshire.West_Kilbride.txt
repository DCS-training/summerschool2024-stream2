places wet and springy:  but to this general description there
are exceptions; and there might be still more, were any justice
done to the land, or proper attempts made, with judgment
and persevering industry, to overcome or alleviate its natu-
ral disadvantages.  The 3 following soils are the most com-
mon:  A very light, dry, sandy soil, with a mixture of good
earth; the mossy; and a strong tilly clay.  These different soils,
point out to the intelligent farmers, what method of cultiva-
tion they would require.  It is agreed, that compost of dung,
earth, and lime, would suit the first mentioned soil; and that
when laid down richly, it would produce excellent crops of
clover and other grasses; yet this hath never been sufficiently
tried:  and until of late years, the farmers in this part of the
country, who had adopted the very worst practice of the old
husbandry, remained utterly unacquainted with the method
of laying down land in this manner.  However, nature has
done a great deal for them here, by affording a spontaneous
manure, which is well adapted to the light land, and, in a
great measure, supersedes the necessity of any other, and that
is sea-weed, which is thrown in in such vast quantities by
the winter gales, that the people have only to be at the pains
to lead it out and lay it upon their fields.  This manure,
from its hot stimulating nature, is of quick operation, and
when aided by a moist summer, and refreshing flowers,
throws up bountiful crops.  For many years, this was the
only manure used for general cultivation; and it was applied
to all soils indiseriminately, to which it could be transported;
and where this was not practicable, the land was left without
any other means of improvement, than what it derived from
mere rest; any little dung made upon the farm, being used
for raising potatoes and bear.  The method of management
for the outfield land of such farms as lie without the reach
of sea-weed, is to let it rest for 4 years; then plough it for 2
