  REPORT

OF THE

COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIETY FOR THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS
OF THE CLERGY SUPERINTENDING THE NEW STATISTICAL
ACCOUNT OF SCOTLAND,

TO THE

GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.

 THE Committee intimated to the General Assembly of 1832
their desire to procure a New Statistical Account of Scotland;
which they proposed to obtain by requesting from the parochial
Clergy a description of their respective parishes.
 The General Assembly was pleased to approve of the undertak-
ing, and to "recommend to the members of the Church to give all
the aid in their power toward its completion."
 The completion of the work, which is now at hand, furnishes
another occasion to the Committee of respectfully bringing the
subject under the notice of the Assembly. The first Number was
published in March 1834; the last Number is now at press, and
will appear in the course of a few weeks.
 The work is comprised in 52 Numbers, which were issued regu-
larly at stated times of publication. The whole, with the Ac-
counts of the different parishes brought under their respective
Counties, will be bound in 15 volumes. At the same time, the collect-
ed Accounts of each of the Counties will be published in separate vo-
lumes,-an arrangement for which the great extent of the under-
taking had made it necessary to provide from the commencement.
 It was intended, at first, to have concluded with a General Sum-
mary of the more important facts which, throughout the work, have
