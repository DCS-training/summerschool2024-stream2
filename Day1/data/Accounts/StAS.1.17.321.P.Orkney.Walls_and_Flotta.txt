   Their attendance at church, and on all religious ordi-
nances, is punctual; and their services are performed with
all that outward seriousness and solemnity, that usually indi-
cate the inward sincerity of the heart.

   Birds-Ember geese are plenty here in winter, but, being
birds of passage, they disappear in spring, and do not return
till the end of harvest.  How this bird hatches its young, re-
mains a profound secret, both as to the manner and the
place.  That it should be in either of the ways commonly
supposed, under its wings, or in the sands, are conjectures
attended with many difficulties, that render both very im-
probable.  But that they do not breed any where here-abouts
is certain, as their eggs are never found here, nor their young,
till fully grown.
   This bird is also remarkable for its strong structure of bo-
dy; for though considerably less in size than the common
grey goose, it weighs a great deal more.  They sometimes
weigh 18 pounds.  It is never seen on the land; and though
it has pretty large wings, it is never seen to fly.  Every wa-
ter fowl takes the assistance of its feet to raise itself out of
the water, when it is going to fly; but the feet of this bird
are so much in a right line with its body, that they can
never be brought far enough forward to assist it in rising out
of the water.  Nor does nature seem to have intended that
it ever should fly; for in whatever manner it is attacked,
pursued, or suddenly surprised, it always has recourse to div-
ing for its safety.  Being a bird of passage, it differs from all
others, in preferring, on that occasion, the medium of water
to that of air; and as it makes its way, probably with equal
speed, by means of its wings, (for sea fowls are frequently
seen using their wings under water), so it accomplishes it
with equal certainty.
