nobleman of the finest taste.  It consists of two rows of houses
opposite to, and distant from each other thirty-two falls, (a-
bout 200 yards).  Down the middle of that space runs a small
rivulet, to which there is a gentle descent from each row.
The village is two furlongs and thirty falls long; and the
whole area on each side of the rivulet consists of grass, for the
use of the inhabitants.  There they may bleach their linen,
etc. etc. but no cattle are allowed to graze or tread on it.  A

village, on the rivulet, a large cotton work is just now erect-

garden, and the other common emoluments.  The whole will

   Division of the Inhabitants.-In the country part of the pa-

do the farmer and dairy work, with very little additional as-
sistance.  In the 63 farms in the parish, there are not above 40
male, and 63 female servants, except in hay time and harvest,
when a few labourers and cottagers are hired occasionally.  The
trades people live all in the village.  A few years ago, there
