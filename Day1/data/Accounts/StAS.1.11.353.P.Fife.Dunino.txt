it, two huge rocks seem to threaten an embrace over the per-
ennial stream below, appears to have naturally suggested the
name, Denino; or, in other words, the Village on the Den.
And, when it is further known, that, unless in cafes of inac-
curacy, or of inadvertency, the ancient and modern ortho-
graphies of Denino are uniformly the same, the latter opi-
nion, with regard to its original, must appear the more cre-
dible.  The first syllable of the word being attended with no
difficulty, by only admitting a common transposition, as to
the two remaining ones, Denino and the Village ON THE DEN,
will appear plainly synonymous.

   Situation and Extent.-The parish lies among the eastern
districts of the county of Fise, on the road between St. An-
drews and Anstruther.  The extent of Denino is uncommonly
circumscribed, being scarcely 3 miles in length, and little more
than half as much in breadth.

   Figure, Surface, Rivulets and Fish.-The form of the parish
is pretty regular; distinguished by no intersections from other
parishes; to a good degree paralellogramical; with a large
extent of its centre surrounded by circularly rising ground,
which, being generally but barren, produces a singular conca-
vity of very considerable fertility.  It is beautifully inter-
spersed with a variety of small rivers, abounding with trout
of various species and of moderate size, but of superior fla-
vour.  The wild and protuberant banks of these rivulets, if
suitably decorated with those diversities of plantation, with
which, to the honour, and, eventually, to the emolument of
their proprietors, they now begin to be occupied, must pre-
sent scenes highly picturesque and gratifying.
