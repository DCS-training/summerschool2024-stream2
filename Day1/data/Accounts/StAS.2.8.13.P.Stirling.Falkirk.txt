tuated it the middle of a finely wooded park, and is the chief or-
nament of the eastern Carse. The original part of the building is
very ancient, but successive additions have been made to suit the
convenience or taste of the possessor. Its present appearance is
that of a mansion of the Elizabethan times.
   Bantaskine House, the residence of T. C. Hagart, Esq., is an
elegant and substantial mansion of modern architecture. It Stands
on an elevated spot, half a mild southwest of the town, and
partakes of the fine prospect which has already been adverted to.
The grounds are encircled by luxuriant plantations.
   Modern Buildings.--The office and dwelling-house for their
agent, lately erected by the, Commercial Banking Company, in
the High Street, is a superb structure, and beautifies the part of
the town where it stands. The meeting-house of the Secession
at the east, and the Relief Church at the west end of the town,
are large plain buildings, and do not contribute advantageously to
the appearance of the place.

		      III.--POPULATION.
	     The population of this parish in 1755, was 3932
                                               1792,     8020
                                               1801,     8838

                                               1831,    12,748
                                               1835,    13,037

   The gradual increase may be ascribed to improvements in agri-
culture and the extension of trade and manufactures.
     In 1831, the number of inbabitants.residing in the towns and
                  villages of the parish was  .     .     .         10,294

                                                                    12,748

   There is only one nobleman (Earl of Zetland) who has a dwel-
ling-house in the parish, but who resides chiefly in England. The
number of individuals or families of independent fortune, and not
engaged in business, may be seven. The proprietors of land of
the yearly value of L.50 and upwards, may be estimated at forty
in number. The people are, in general, contented with their si-
tuation and circumstances; and the great proportion are moral and
religious, in so far as can be judged from regular attendance at
public worship and outward decency of conduct.
   Poaching in game is practised by some individuals. Smuggling
may be said to have entirely ceased. Pawnbroking is carried on
a small extent, although there is none licensed for that trade.
