purpose are now too small, there will probably be a necci-
sity for such assessment in a short time, unless the funds be
increased.  The whole collections in a year scarce exceed
L. 12, and for a considerable time past, the quarterly distri-
bution has been near L. 6, sometimes upwards.  Any of
the poor who are able to travel, are permitted to beg
through the parish, and have therefore a smaller allowance
at the quarterly distributions.

   Population, etc.-According to the return made to Dr
Webster, the numbers were then 891.-Nine years ago they
were about 1000, and now must be greater, Earl Gal-
loway's village being already four times larger than it for-
merly was.  The number of births in the parish is annually
about 20; of marriages about 5; of deaths about 9 or 10.
The number of tradesmen in the parish is about 33: weavers
and their apprenties 10, tailors 4, shoemakers 6, smiths 4,
masons 4, joiners 5. Diseases are not frequent here, except
such as are common to children.  Consumptions indeed seem
to be more prevalent now, than they were in former times.
There are several both men and women in this parish
above 80 years of age, and one man who is said to be above
100.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The wages of common la-
bourers, which used to be not many years ago 4 d. a-day
in winter, and 6 d. in the other seasons, with victuals, are
now increased to 6 d. in the short, and 8 d. in the long day.
Mechanics in general get higher wages than common la-
bourers.  Masons get 1 s. 2 d. and joiners 1 s. with vic-
tuals.  The common labourer, however, for mowing in the
hay season, gets from 1 s . to 1 s. 4 d. with victuals.  The
wages of common servants are near double of what they
were about 10 years ago.  A ploughman gets from L. 4
