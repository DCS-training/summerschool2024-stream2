The parish is laboured by about 24 ploughs.  Every two

ploughs of land, commonly keeps two boys for taking care
of the cattle, and two women, chiefly for harvest work.

There are about 110 horses, 400 cows, oxen, and young

   Church and Poor.-The stipend of this parish is five and a
half chalders of victual, and about L. 28 in money, with a
manse and a glebe of six acres.  The church was built by 
Archbishop Spottiswood, in 1622, when he was proprietor of
the estate of Dairsie.  In the old house near the church, it is
said, that he wrote his history.  The church is a remarkably
neat and well proportioned building, having a flat lead roof,
and a spire on the south-west corner.  Its situation is beauti-
ful and picturesque.  The manse was built in 1749.  Besides
Mifs Scot, who is proprietor of a great part of this parish,
there are four other heritors, none of whom, except a minor,
reside in the place.  There are four or five persons support-
ed by the poor's funds.  The contributions for the relief of 
the poor on the Lord's day are from 3 s. to 3 s. 6 d. weekly.
