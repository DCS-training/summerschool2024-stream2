     The Statistical Account.

   But, allowing the utility of villages in its utmost extent;
still the establishment of private manufactories can be no em-
barrassment upon that utility, or upon the business of farm-
ing.  To corroborate which, we need only look to our neigh-
bouring country Ireland, crowded with cities and villages,
and farming also carried on to a great extent.
   Hence this measure, among many other advantages, would
be a vast source of population.  What crowds of both sexes,
in different corners of the kingdom, leave their native soil in
quest of employment!  thousands of whom, by a sudden tran-

the linen market.  What has not nature done, what would
not industry do, in that well-situated isle?  Prosperous and
happy might she be, were not that happiness abused.  The
Irish lord, wallowing in luxury, is consequently regardless
of the shameful abuse committed by the destructive mode of
wadsetting, or nearly so, his fruitful soil, by renting it to a
few, who are denominated respectable farmers.  These sub-

sixth.  From the second class, what strides does oppression
make!  By remedying this source of grievance, Ireland
would become happy, prosperous and peaceful.
   To this mode of oppression, how striking the following
