town." * Miss Shaw was afterwards married to Mr Miller, the
minister of Kilmaurs, about the year 1718, but died at Bargarran,
and was intered in the church-yard here, though it is to be re-
gretted that no monument has been erected to indicate the precise
locality.
   Mr Maxwell, younger of Dargavel, has kindly furnished,from
documents in possession of the family, the particulars of the last
pass of arms which took place in the parisb, arising from a quar-
rel between the lairds of Dargavel and Orbistoun. Dargavel, ac-
cording to immemorial usage, claimed right to door, seat, and bu-
rial-place within the old church of Erskine; to this, Hamilton of
Orbistoun, then laird of Erskine, objected. In 1692, the matter
seems to have been referred to Sir John Maxwell of Pollock, who
decided it in favour of Dargavel, and he accordingly employed
workmen to strike out a door. Orbistoun then resorted to force,
in consequence of which he was served with a criminal complaint
by Sir William Lockhart, Solicitor-General, which, after stating
the crime of invading a man's property in a military manner with
armed men, drums, and trumpets, thus proceeds, " Nevertheless,

seatts, and by burruing the dead of their family in that place of
the kirk, yet true it is that William Hamiltoune of Orbiotous;
George Maxwell, baillie of Kilpatrick; Mr Adam Wilsone, clerk;
Robert Lang, miller in Duntocher; Shaw of Bargarron; Walk-
ingshaw of that Ilk, (and a long list of other names,)shaking off all                       all

the 25th day of Apryle last, or ane or oyer of the dayes of the said
month,they did in almost treasonable manner, convocate them-
selves and several oyer their accomplices, to the number of ane
hundred persons, all armed with guns, pistolls, swords, baganets,
and oyer weapons, and having appointed George Maxwell, Or-
bistoun's oun baillie depute, to be their commander, and march
upon their head, as their captain, they did come, marching in mi-
litary manner, with drums beating and trumpets sounding, (and
which can admit of no oyer construction than a downright defiance
of our authority and lawes,) to the parish kirk of Erskine, and in a
