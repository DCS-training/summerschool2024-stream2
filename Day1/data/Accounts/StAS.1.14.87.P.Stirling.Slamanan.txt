with great swellings in their legs; and not a few have
died of the dropsy, which, it is probable, also originates
from the same cause.  What strengthens this opinion,
is, that these complaints are more frequent among the
lower class of the inhabitants, the few families who
are in a superior station, and have comfortable houses,
not being subject to them.  Otherwise the people are
generally pretty healthy; and I have observed fewer
fevers here than in the neighbouring parishes.

   Church, Stipend, etc.-The walls of the church were
rebuilt about the year 1753; but the old seating was
still continued, which indeed is very old; many seats
being marked with the year 1632, and some of them
even so far back as the year 1556.  It stands, there-
fore, in much need of being renewed.  When the an-
nexation was joined to this parish, they were allowed
to build an aile, for their own accommodation, upon the
N. side of the church, at their own expense, and to up-
hold it for 20 years; and the heritors of Slamannan were
bound to uphold the old church for the same number of
years; after which they were all to bear any expense
upon the church and church-yard walls, in proportion
to their valuations.  But as they were otherwise annex-
ed only quoad sacra, they pay no part of the minister's
stipend.  The King is patron.  The stipend is 50 l. Ster-
ling in money, 2 chalders of meal, and 1 chalder of bear,
a manse and glebe of about 15 acres.  There is also 3 l.
6 s. 8 d. for furnishing communion elements, together
with the interest of 500 merks, which is in the hands
of the session.  The manse was built more than 30 years
ago, since which time it hath not only been frequently
repaired, but had a considerable addition made to it.
