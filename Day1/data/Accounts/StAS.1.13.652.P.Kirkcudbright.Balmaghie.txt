     Statistical Account

   Here Iyes David Halliday, portioner of Meifield, who
was shot upon the 21 ft of February 168 s, and David Hal-
liday, once in Glengape, who was likewise shot upon the
11th of July 168 s, for their adherence to the principles of
Scotland's Covenanted Reformation.

Beneath This Stone Two David Hallidays
Do Lie, Whose Souls Now Sing Their Master's Praife.
To Know If curious Passengers Desire,
For What, By Whom, And How They Did Expire,
They Did Oppose This Nation's Perjury,
Nor Could They Join Whith Lordly Prelacy.
Indulging Favours From Christ's Enemies,
Quench'd Not Their Zeal This Monument Then Cries,
These Were The Causes Not To Be Forgot,
Why They By Lag So Wickedly Were Shot;
One Name, One Cause, One Grave, One Heav'n Do Tie
Their Sould To That God Eternally.

   Such productions of the unletter'd Muse are not unwor-
thy of being preserved.  They are not indeed to be con-
sidered as monuments of taste and genius; but they serve
a better purpose, while they perpetuate the memory of
those public measures, which in the last century rendered
a Revolution necessary; and awaken in the minds of the
people, those sentiments of satisfaction and gratitude, with
which they ought ever to contemplate that great event,
which completely supersedes the necessity of another, and
to which, under God, we ascribe our glory as a nation and
a church.
