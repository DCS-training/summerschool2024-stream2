   Surface and Agriculture.-The face of the country, like the
rest of the Highlands, is mountainous and rocky, and, to a
stranger, shockingly rugged.  The more inland parts, which
constitutes Lord Reay's dear forest, are nothing but a vast
group of dreadful mountains, with their summers piercing the
clouds, and divided only be deep and very narrow vallies,
whose declivities are so rugged and steep, as to be dangerous
to travellers not furnished with guides.  Yet these wilds, afford
excellent pasture, in many places, to all forts of cattle, being
clothed, to the tops of the highest mountains, with clover and
daisies, and other rich pasture.  In many places numbers
of deer are to be seen, very large and fat, especially in the
harvest season; for looking after which certain persons, called
forresters, are appointed with salaries, in convenient parts of
the country.  The bouds of the forest are very extensive,
making a considerable, if not the greater part, of Lord Reay's
estate; but that part of it which is reckoned the bell, and a-
bounds most with deer, is that which belongs to this parish.
The inhabited places are only those next the sea, and some o-
ther on the confines of the forest, which happen to be some-
what level, and there by sitter for reaning cattle, or the culture
of corn; and though, towards the coast, the ruggedness of
the ground be less, and the mountains seemingly subside, or
present a less awful and horrid appearance, yet rocks and
marshes, lakes and mountains, though of less magnitude, are
all along continually intermixed; so that, excepting pasture for
cattle, it seems but very indifferently calculated by nature for
any other purpose.  It is matter of no small difficulty, even on
the shore, to find a lot fir for a house to stand on conveniently,
without under water, or some other remarkable disadvantage.
-And as for the villages or dwellings, where the inhabitants
make a shift to rear some corn, they have so great labour in
clearing their little plots (many of which are no larger than the
