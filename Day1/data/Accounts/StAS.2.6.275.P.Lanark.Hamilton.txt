in front of the prison, of two stories. In the west end, in the lower
flat, there are three rooms for the sheriff-clerk, with a record-
room. The town-clerk has four rooms in the east end. In the
centre, there is a court room, 37 feet long, and 32 broad. In the
upper story, there is a large ball, for county meetings, &c. 47 feet
10 inches by 32 feet, with an adjacent room, 15 feet by 12 feet
1 1/2 inch. The prison, which stands at a little distance behind, is
three stories high. It is 80 feet 9 inches in ldngth, and 32 feet
4 inches in breadth, comprising in all 45 cells, and 6 water-closets,
with a large day room for debtors, 19 1/2 feet by 13, and four other
rooms for them, each 9 feet by 71, besides two day rooms for other
prisoners. The first flat, with 12 cells, is to be used as a Bride-
well. The second flat has 16 cells and 4 day rooms. The up-
per flat is to be appropriated to debtors. It also contains separate
apartments for females. The governor's house stands between
the public offices and the prison. In the under story, there is a
kitchen, a servants' room and bed-room, and a bath for the gaol.
There are four apartments in the upper story. The prison and
governor's house are to be surrounded with a wall 15 feet high,
enclosing a large court, half an acre in extent. These buildings
are now in a forward state. They stand on the high grounds, to
the west of the town, on the Blantyre road, near the Cavalry Bar-
racks. The old prison and court-ball at the Cross, built in the
reign of Charles L, are soon to be demolished. The present
town-hall, near the old gaol, has also been bought up. The
butcher-market, with shambles, stand on the brink of Cadzow
burn, near the middle of the town. This is a modern erection of
respectable appearance. The meal-market, in the Muir Wynd,
has long been in disuse. The public fire-engines, ladders, &c.
are kept here. There are other fire-engines belonging to the pa-
lace and barracks; and an old ladder is pointed out, which is said
to have been used at public executions. The Cavalry Barracks
are much in the, style of those at Perth and Edinburgh. Besides
stables, with accommodation above for the men, there are officers'
barracks, an hospital, and riding-room. These occupy a large
space of ground, and are surrounded by a high wall.
