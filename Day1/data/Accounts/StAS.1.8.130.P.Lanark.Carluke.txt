     Statistical Account

the village of Carluke increases more rapidly than any other.
From consisting, about 24 years ago, of 4 or 5 houses, with
little trade, it is now advanced to a large and decent village;
so that it finds employment for a surgeon, a baker, a vintner,
and several grocers.  There are also in it, butchers, weavers,
stocking-makers, masons, tailors, wrights, inn-keepers, road-
makers, haberdashers, and coopers; and even some milliners
and mantua-makers, in the town, or near to it.  A new village,
it is said, is soon to be built, or feued out, on the road lead-
ing to Killcaigow, under the patronage of the Messrs. Glens;
and a cotton work to be erected nigh it, to be driven by a
steam engine.

   Heritors and Population-There are, in all, about 60 he-
ritors of this parish, of whom 40 pay stipend.  The Earl of
Hyndford, the principal heritor, has his seat here; and, in
May 1792, laid the foundation of his new castle, at Maulds-
lie.  The number of inhabitants, though upon the increase,
is not so great as might have been expected.  The reasons al-
ready assigned, in a great degree, account for it.  In 1755,
the whole inhabitants of the parish were stated by Dr. Web-
ster at 1459.  They amounted, about 25 years ago, to 1592.
and in August 1792, the number was 1730.  From the pa-
rish register (which perhaps is not very accurately kept), it
would appear, that the annual average of births, marriages
and burials, for 10 years past, is as follows:  births, 40; mar-
riages, 18; burials, 28.  The proportion between males and
females, for the same length of time, appears to be, nearly,
as 11 to 10.

   Ecclesiastical State, etc.-There is only one place of public
worship in this parish, and one established minister.  The
