farms, where, if properly directed, it will ever be most pro-
ductive.  There is abundance of freestone and muirstone
also, in several places of the parish.

   Commerce, Roads, etc.-Portmoak imports ale, spirits,
coals, yarn, calf and sheep skins.  It exports oats, oat-meal,
barley, black cattle, butter, cheese, poultry, lime-shells,
green linen, checks, vellum and parchment.  The raw ma-
terials, wrought up annually by the weavers in this parish,
receive an additional value, from their art, of about L. 900.
The limestone sold produces upwards of L. 350.-The only
bridge in the parish is that across the Leven, which was
built about 100 years ago.-The roads, which are in very
bad order, were originally made, and are still repaired by
the statute labour, which is now commuted.

   Church and School.-The church was built in 1659, till
which period, part of the old priory served for a place of
worship.  It was repaired about 5 years ago, and is tole-
rably decent.  The manse was built about 50 years ago,
and is in very good order.  The stipend is L. 50, and 4
chalders of grain; of which 26 bolls are meal, 22 barley,
and 16 oats, with 50 merks for communion-elements.
The glebe contains about 13 acres, one half of which is
good soil, and the other very bad.  The patron is George
Graham, Esq; of Kinross.-The parochial schoolmaster's sa-
lary, (which is 100 merks), together with his school-fees
and other perquisites, may amount to about L. 22; a re-
ward by no means adequate to the abilities and application
necessary to discharge, with success, the duties of so impor-
tant an office.  There were lately built a good school and
school-house.  The number of scholars who attend the
whole year may be about 60.
