    122                   WIGTONSHIRE.

    the presbytery and synod, of a donation of L. 1 to the Dumfries and
    Galloway Infirmary, and of about L.3,7s. paid for coffins for the
    poor, leaves to be divided yearly among the poor about L.45, 3s.
    There never has been any compulsory assessment here: a voluntary
    assessment, which in some years has amounted to L. 30, but has
    more frequently been under L. 20, is paid by the heritors, to pro-
    vide for cases different from general indigence. Such are cases of
    or idiots, who have no funds of their own, and whose friends are
    unable to provide for their children that have fallen to be supported
    by the parish, and aged person left destitute, and unable to take
    care of themselves.
    Fuel.- Peats are the ordinary fuel in this district.  In places
    near the Bay of Lobh Ryan, some coals brought from Ayshire
    are also used.
    Ale-houses.- There are four houses licensed to sell ale and
    spirits: they are all in the village.

    MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

    In addition to what has been mentioned under the heads of po-
    pulation and agriculture, to show the difference betwixt the pre-
    sent state of the parish, and that which existed at the time of the
    former Statistical Account, the following fact may be noticed, as
    tistical Account was drawn up, there was only one slated farm-
    house;  now, on all the considerable farms, in number about 40,
    the farm-houses are slated, and in general are handsomely fur-
    nished. Their offices are for the most part slated also.
    From the neighbouring port of Stranraer, the farmers here have
    the advantage of communication by steam-boats with Glasgow and
    Belfast, and sometimes with Whitehaven and Liverpool.  The parish
    roads, however, in some parts of the interior, and in the south-
    west quarter generally, are still very bad.
