dustry by pillage; so that no kind of property, which is neces-
sarily exposed to depredation, is any longer safe.
   Amidst this general dissolution of manners, the people of
Hamilton may be rather said to be deficient in virtue, than de-
termined in vice.  Their irregularities appear rather to pro-
ceed from thoughtlessness, than confirmed depravity.  Some
traces of their antient humanity may be still discovered on dif-
ferent occasions.  Though petty breaches of justice and good
order are frequent, atrocious deeds of cruelty and wickedness
are not known.  In the course of forty years, no person has
been accused of murder:  Robbery and house-breaking have
very seldom been committed; and there is no instance of any
individual, during his residence in the parish, having been  con-
victed of such crimes.  Much has been said of the happy influ-
ence of Sunday schools in other places.  If there were people
of wealth and influence heartily disposed to strengthen virtue,
to encourage good behavior, and to discountenance vice and
irregularity, by establishing that institution  here, in order to
rescue the children of dissolute parents, from the danger of bad
habits, to instruct them in the principles of religion, and a
course of forbriety and industry, it is probable, they might be
the happy means of restoring and improving the morals of all
the people in this populous district.
   The young men of this parish have always shown a great ar-
dour for a military life.  A popular recruiting officer never
comes to the place, in time of war, without making great le-
vies.  In the year 1778, above sixty enlifted in the regiment
raised by the Duke of Hamilton, besides some who entered with
other corps.  The women have shown little less eagerness to
follow the camp, a good many always going off, with every par-
ty of the military, who have been quartered here.
