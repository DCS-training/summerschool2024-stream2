and manner of this election, by the Town-council, has since
varied, according to the different sets, or constitutions, adopt-
ed by the Council at different periods.  In 1711, the for-
mer set underwent some alterations, which were confirmed
by the Convention of Royal Burghs.  In 1748, another set
was adopted and agreed to by the Council, Merchants, and
Trades Houses; and, being confirmed that year by the Con-

number was not adequate to the business of the office, and
requested him to add one or two more to their number.
This curious fact may serve to give some idea of the trou-

much increased.
   The citizens are divided into two ranks, merchants and
tradesmen, which last consist of 14 incorporations.  These,
besides holding a monopoly in their different branches, are
possessed of considerable funds for their own poor, and
each of them have a subordinate government over their re-
spective members, but no civil or criminal jurisdiction.  We
have no record when this distinction first took place; but
we find, that, about the beginning of the 17th century,
