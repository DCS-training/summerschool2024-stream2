might have taken their stations, and annoyed the boats at-

Ware, in his antiquities of that kingdom, informs us, that

parts of Ireland.  The Cartilla Brigantum, mentioned by
Juvenal in his fourteenth Satyr, were probably of the same
kind.  Near Cliffdale, some short time ago, when the work-
men were digging for the foundation of a house, they disco-
