   Agriculture.-The greatest part of this pariah is adapted
to pasturage, being part of the Pentland hills; and it is suppos-

attention more to this object, in other parts of the parish.
The most profitable crops are oats and grass, and the most

150 cows and oxen, and about 100 horses.  The sheep in this

profitable.  Smearing is universally practised by the farmers.
