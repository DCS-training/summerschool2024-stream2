     (County of Lanark-Presbytery of Glasgow-Synod of
     Glasgow and Ayr.)

     By Mr. WILLIAM BARCLAY, Schoolmaster.

     Name, Extent, and Situation.

   CADDER, the name of this parish, is derived from a
Gaelic word, and said to signify the Back of the Oak
Wood, which corresponds exactly to the situation of Cadder
House.  It is often spelt Calder.  The parish is 13 miles in
length from E. to W., and between 3 and 4 miles in breadth*.
It lies in the northern extremity of the county of Lanark.
The 3 counties, Lanark, Dumbarton, and Stirling, all meet
at the north point of this parish.  The nearer point of it is
3 miles from the city of Glasgow, within half a mile of the
town of Kirkintilloch, and 3 miles from Kilfyth and Cumber-
nauld.  Gartinqueen Hill, in this parish, is said to be at an
equal distance from Hamilton, Falkirk, and Stifling.

*There was a map of Cadder drawn in the year 1743, from a survey
made by David Dowie, land-surveyor in Edinburgh, but it is in few hands.
