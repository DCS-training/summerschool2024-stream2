prompt and respectable; and individuals belonging to the place
have fought with Abercromby in Egypt, with Nelson at Trafal-
gar, and with Wellington at Waterloo. There is a generous feel-
ing in the better classes towards their inferiors, which has been
evinced in liberal subscriptions and exertions for them during pe-
riods of public distress. Were there more morality and sobriety,
there would be less poverty and want, and the indigent would be
more cheerfully and liberally supplied, having the claims of cha-
racter to plead on their behalf, and giving the assurance that they
would use prudently and beneficially the alms they received. There
is generally speaking a good attendance on public worship, yet it
is to be regretted that this divine and merciful ordinance is most
neglected by the operative and poorer classes, who, being less en-
lightened by educations and having a greater struggle with the
world, and being more exposed to the snares and temptations of
sin, stand in the greater need of the instructions and warnings, aids,
and consolations of the Gospel preached. And it is painful to con-
clude, that, amid many favourable symptoms, there is mingled much
carelessness about religion, and much profanation of the Sabbath;
while many are given to intemperance and vice, bringing on them-
selves, and entailing on their helpless families, wretchedness and
misery, and gradually undermining those habits of industry, and
that spirit of independence, which were so long characteristic of
the people of  Scotland.
