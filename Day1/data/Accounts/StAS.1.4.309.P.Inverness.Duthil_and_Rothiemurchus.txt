fir, birch and alder, on the skirts of the hills; but beyond
them it is covered with heath, and is rocky.  It is divi-
ded nearly into two equal parts by the river Dulnan, sig-
nifying in Gaelic, "floody," running from W. to E. a-
bout 14 miles.  On both sides of which lies a great part
of the arable ground.  The soil towards the lower end of
the parish, which widens into a flat for several miles, fre-
quently overflowed by the Dulnan, is deep.  Towards the
upper end, and at a distance from the river, shallow, yet
fertile through the whole.  The climate is extremely
healthy, and the most common distempers are nervous fe-
vers, and swellings in the joints, occasioned, most proba-
bly, by the vicissitudes of heat and cold, which occasion
too frequent and imprudent changes of warmer clothing
for the Highland garb.  There are several mineral springs
in the parish, two of which have been serviceable in the
gravel.

   Animals, &c.-The quadrupeds are of the common
kind in the Highlands.  Some of the horses are of the
large labouring species.  The Highland garrons, as they
are called, though not so sufficient for labour, are more a-
dapted to the lower class of people, easily supported, by
running out in the fields most part of winter.  This
country, once stored with the finest woolled kind of sheep,
has for some years been over-run with the coarse Linton
breed, which ought to be extirpated from every country.
The parish abounds with grouse, partridge and black-
game, and a vast variety of the smaller kind of birds.
The wood-cock appears in October, and disappears in
April.

   Population.-At the time of Dr Webster's report, the
numbers in Duthil and Rothiemurchus were 1785.  In
