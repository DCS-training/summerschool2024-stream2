     Parish of Peterculter.

     Additions by the Rev. Mr Mark.

   One thing has been omitted, of which it had, perhaps,
been proper to have taken some notice.  I mean the practice
of carrying cripple beggars through the country on a hand-
barrow or wooden frame, for the purpose of collecting alms.
The times chosen for their circumportation, are generally
those of sowing and reaping; when it is difficult to find
hands to carry them from place to place, without interrupt-
ing the work of the season.  Were it not better, that the pa-
rishes to which these cripples belong, should be obliged to
maintain them at home?  If they cannot afford them suffi-
cient maintenance, neighbouring parishes ought to assist them.
   I was in some suspence about my political conclusion, whe-
ther I should send or retain it.  As I sometimes met with
grumblers, and frequently heard complaints, such as those
mentioned; as I now and then perceived a tendency to de-
mocratical principles, I thought my observations might be
considered as characteristical of some classes of people in our
times:  I thought that some general reflections would be more
useful than a long closely prosecuted argument; and as the
work of which your Honour has the merit, will probably
exist as long as any human production, I thought they might be
read when political pamphlets were lost, and might be read with
less prejudice, when the rage of political frenzy had subsided.
