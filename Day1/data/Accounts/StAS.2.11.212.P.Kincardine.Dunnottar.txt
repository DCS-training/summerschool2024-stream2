                  THE REV. ALEXANDER IRVINE, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY
	Name.--DUNNOTTAR, anciently spelt Dunotyr, is said to be a
compound Gaelic word signifying a place of strength on a penin-
sular promontory. Such was the Castle of Dunnottar, within the
walls of which formerly stood the parish church.
	Extent, &c.--The area of the parish is an irregular three-sided
figure. The eastern side runs from Stonehaven, southward along
the coast, to and inclusive of the fishing village of Crawton, a dis-
tance of about five miles. From Crawton, the boundary runs
about five miles nortb-westward, in a zig-zag line, abutting first on
the parish of Kineff, and then on the parish of Glenbervie, pas-
sing with the latter over Carmount moor, to the summit of Car-
mount bill, and thence descending, into Carron Water, at the
base of that bill, where Dunnottar and Glenbervie are met by
the parish of Fetteresso. On the northern side, the Carron, wind-
ing a course of about five miles, from where it leaves the territory
of Glenbervie, till it enters the sea at Stonehaven, forms, with
some small exceptions, the boundary with Fetteresso. According
to a map of Kincardineshire, by Mr Francis Garden, in 1744, thd
parish contains 8156 "English acres," or nearly 13 square miles.
	Topographical Appearance.--The seaward, boundary of this
parish is a continuous chain of rocks, consisting partly of detached
masses and bluff headlands, but chiefly of a range of cliffs rising
