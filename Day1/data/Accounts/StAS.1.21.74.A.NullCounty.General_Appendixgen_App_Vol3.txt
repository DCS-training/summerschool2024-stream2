Small Highland oats, sowing 100 penny lands-300 bolls
  -increase, near 3 returns-850 bolls.
Bear, lowing 120 bolls-increase, 5 returns-510 bolls.
Potatoes, feed, 18 bolls-increase, 4 returns-72 bolls.
Pease, 1 boll feed -increase, 7 bolls.

   With regard to the annual produce, the four articles con-
descended on, are the chief produce of the parish; and the
land is designed by penny lands, instead of the general term
of acres.  Mr Sage was obliged to make this substitution, as
the arable land was never measured into acres.  The hay, which
is meadow grass, cannot be ascertained, as it is seldom or ever
weighed or sold among the Highlanders.
