	assessment, and, we have every reason to believes, placed them in
	a more comfortable condition than they are at present.  In  pro-
	cess of time, the population and the number of Dissenters increas-
	ed, an assessment was resorted to ; it increased the number of
	paupers, but not the means of subsistence; it lessened our church
	door-collections, and our private charity, and last, and worst of all,
	it encouraged parents to turn a deaf ear to the call of instinctive
	parental affection, and to desert their own offspring.  Mr Monypen-
	ny has clearly shown, that the only cure to these evils is to be
	found in an extension of the parochi`l system, that is, in the sub-
	division of our overgrown parishes, and the providing of a sum-
	cient amount of pastoral and parochial superintendence.*  The vo-
	luntary assumption of the care of their own paupers by the ma-
	nagers of the several congregations of all professing Christians,-
	a plan which has been sometimes talked of, might, in some mea-
	sure, mitigate the evil which the assessment is intended to remedy;
	but there is no effectual cure but the dissemination of sound reli-
	gious principle, and the creation of moral habits, by a faithful, af-
	fectionate, and zealous ministry.
