   Proprietors, Rent, etc.-The first of these three districts,
about one half of the second, and the whole of the third, be-
long to the Honourable W. Maule of Panmuir.  The re-
maining part belongs to Sir Alexander Ramsay Irvine, Bart.
The first district, whose surface is almost a dead flat, never
fails, with good management, to produce, in ordinary years,
good crops of oats, bear, (rough bear or Chester), pease, tur-
nips, flax, and potatoes.  The land, though less strong and
rich than in many other places, is dry and early.  It has hap-
pened for a course of years, that when the crops have greatly
failed in other places of thc country, the farmers in this
quarter have enjoyed crops much above the rate of their
neighbourhood.  Artificial grass, especially white clover, pro-
spers well; but that rich and permanent sward of grass
which is found in more powerful soils, is wanting here.
Rent, in this quarter, does not exceed 9 s. per acre, which is
easy to pay, from the industry and improvements of the pre-
sent lessees.  About 60 acres of village lands, occupied by
about a dozen of families, give 15 s. or thereby.  The tenants
in this quarter stand chiefly by grain and black cattle.  The
two other districts have not the same advantages, as labour
upon them is liable to be kept back in seed-time; and the
crop, from the wetness of the bottom, is subject to be cast too
late in harvest.  One half of the middle district, whereof the
soil is inferior, rents still lower than the former division.
The other half yields about 10 s.  In this quarter, the te-
nants have the advantage of sheep, in addition to their grain
and black cattle.  The rent of the third district, which is
far from means of improvement, and which is still more ex-
posed to bad seasons, cannot be well ascertained.  The pro-
