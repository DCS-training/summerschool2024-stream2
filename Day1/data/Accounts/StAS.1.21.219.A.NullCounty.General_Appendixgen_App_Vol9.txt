sheltered on the N. by a range of hills from one end to the
other.  It is in general very dry in the summer and harvest
months; and even in the rest of the year there is not much
rain or snow, compared to other countries, or even to a part
of this same country: and when there is a fall of snow, it

   There are some instances of longevity.  Some have attain-

proper management of that useful animal: but it may be
supposed that a little time will enlighten them in that useful
