meal; 700 merks Scotch money; 100 merks Scotch, for
communion elements; and L. 4 st. for firing; the moss, whence
the minister used to be supplied with peats, being lately ex-

acres of ground, (glebe and grass); which, together with the
manse and offices, would set to no great account without pri-

usually from 30 to 40 on the roll, besides some necessitous per-
sons that occasionally need supply.  The inhabitants in gene-

whose benevolence, indeed, is not confined to their own neigh-
bourhood.  The parish could, with ease, support its own poor,
but is harrassed with vagrants.  The failure of crop 1782 was
very distressing; and the succeeding one afforded little relief;

proved uncommonly productive, great numbers would have
been ruined.

   Population.-During the last 20 years, the inhabitants
have increased considerably.  It is said, by scarcity, owing to
unfavourable seasons, during the 7 last years of the preced-

nished.  In 1755, the number was 1527.  The present num-
bers of all ages and religious prosessions are,
