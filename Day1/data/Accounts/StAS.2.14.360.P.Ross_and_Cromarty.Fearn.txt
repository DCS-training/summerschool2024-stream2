				PARISH OF FEARN.

			PRESBYTERY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF ROSS.

			 THE REV. HUGH ROSS, MINISTER.


           I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.--THE name of the parish is the Gaelic word Fearnn,
signifying the alder tree,--there being many of these trees grow-
ing at Mid-fearn, in the parish of Eddertown, in this neighbour-
hood, where the foundation of the abbacy was in the twelfth cen-
tury first laid.  But the churchmen in those days finding the lands
there confined, and not so fertile as they would have wished, got
a new bull from the Pope, for building the abbacy where it now
stands, in a fertile and extensive plain of good land.  It was found-
ed here by Farquhard, or Farquhar, first Earl of Ross, in the
reign of Alexander II.
   Extent, &c.--The parish is of no great extent, being only 2
English miles in length, and nearly of the same breadth.  It is
bounded on the south, by the parish of Nigg; on the west, by
Loggie (Easter) ; on the north, by Tain; and on the east and
south-east, by Tarbat and the Murray Frith.
   The soil is a deep loam, in the centre of the parish, about the
abbacy church.  The loans of Fearn to the south, and the lands
of Allan to the west, are a deep clay; the north and east part is
gravellish: the south-east and south is light and sandy.  The face
of the parish is nearly flat, with the exception of a few eminences,
that are generally laboured.  About three-fourths are arable, the
rest partly green, and partly covered with heath.
   The loch of Eye is above two miles long, and about half a mile
broad.  The Murray Frith lies to the south-east of this parish.
The coast for about a mile is flat and sandy, on which the fishing
town of Balintore lies, and Hiltown, another fishing town about
half a mile to the east of it; there, it is rocky and high for about
a mile more.
