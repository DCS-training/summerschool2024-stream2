luckily, the use of whisky is increasing, and that of beer di-
minishing.  The blue bonnet, a national badge, is disappear-
ring rapidly.  The prevalent colour of the mens dress is blue.

   Church, School, etc.-For seven years past the stipend
has, at an average, been L. 100, including the glebe, which
is large, beside the house and garden.  Claud Boswell, Esq;
of Balmuto, is patron.  A new manse was built in 1784, 
and a new church in 1789.  The income of the schoolmaster
may be about L. 10, independent of the scholars fees, which
are from 1 s. 3 d. to 2 s. a quarter; the number of scholars
from 50 to 60.  There are, besides, two private schools:  The
scholars at both, taken together, may amount to 80.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The air is moist, but not un-
healthy:  Fogs are not frequent, nor of nearly so long conti-

neral well at the bottom of the rocks formerly mentioned,
recorded in Camden's Britannia, and Gordon's Itinerarium,
for its medicinal qualities; but it has not been resorted to for
some time past.  The Lake called Lochgellie is 3 miles in cir-
cumference; that called Camilla about 2 miles.  There is a com-
mon free-stone quarry for house-building, etc.  There is peat
in the parish, but it is little used for fuel.  Coal is to be dug
in every corner of the parish, and scarcely exceeds a farthing a
stone at the pit mouth.  There is likewise great abundance of
lime-stone, which, when burnt and slaked, sells at 7 d. a boll.
The use of it in agriculture is increasing; but not so much here
as in other places where the price is perhaps double or triple.
Industry is increasing; and there are very convenient situations
in which manufactures might be established.  Several wea-
kers living at Lochgellie, and neighbourhood, connect them-
selves with the manufactures of Kirkcaldy.  There is a thri-
