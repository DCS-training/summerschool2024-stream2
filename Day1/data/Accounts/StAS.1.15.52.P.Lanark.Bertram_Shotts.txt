     Statistical Account

   Rivers.-There are two Calders, both of which have their sour-
ces in this district.  The one of these rise, in the N. E. corner
of the parish, and in its progress westward, dividing Shotts from
Torphichen and Newmonkland, falls into the Clyde 5 miles
above Glasgow.  The other Calder rises in the S. E. corner of
this parish, and moving towards the Clyde nearly in the same
direction with the former, in its course divides Shotts from
Cambusnethan.  The waters also of Avon and Cramond
have their first rise in this parish.  The Avon, soon after
leaving Shotts, bends its course northward, and empties itself
into the Firth of Forth near Borrowstownness.  The Cramond,
between its source and Mid Calder, crosses, the great Edinburgh
Road three times, and empties itself into the same Firth at
the village and kirk, to which, in all probability, it gave the
names.
   Hills and Prospects.-The Hirst hill lies a mile E. from the
Kirk of Shotts.  Over this hill the road leading from Glas-
gow to Edinburgh has, for time immemorial, continued to
pass.  Here it is supposed are the highest cultivated lands in
Scotland; this however is thought to be only a popular mis-
take; according to General Roy's mensuration, the Hirst is
upon a level with the Clyde 5 miles above Lanark.  There
are two causes which seem to have led into this mistake:
the waters here issuing from their sources, at a small distance
from each other, run in quite opposite directions; it fol-
lows not, however, from this, that the Hirst rises to the height
supposed; but only that in this precise point, the Hirst is the
highest land between the Friths of Forth and Clyde, the two
seas into which all these waters empty themselves.  In every
direction also from this hill, the country not only begins to
fall, but wherever one turns his eye, for upwards of 20 miles,
no object comes in to mar the view.  All the space there-
