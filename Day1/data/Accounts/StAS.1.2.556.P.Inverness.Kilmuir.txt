     Statistical Account

   In a low valley, there is a small hill, shaped like a house,
and covered with small trees, or rather shrubs, of natural
growth.  At one side of it, there is a lake of soft water, from
which there is no visible discharge.  Its water finds many pas-
sages through the hill, and makes its appearance, on the other
side, in a great number of springs, of the very purest kind:
They all run into an oval bason below, which has a bottom of
white land, and is the habitation of many small fish.  From
that pond, the water runs, in a copious stream, to the sea.
At the side of this rivulet, there is a bath, made of stone,
and concealed from public view, by small trees surrounding
it.  Its name is Loch Shiant, or the sacred lake.  There was
once a great resort of people, afflicted with ailments, to this
place.  They bathed themselves, and drank of the water,
though it has no mineral quality; and, on a shelf, made for
the purpose, in the wall of a contiguous inclosure, they left
offerings of small rags, pins, and coloured threads, to the di-
vinity of the place.

   At the northern termination of the ridge of mountains be-
fore-mentioned, there is a most curious concealed valley:  It is
on all sides surrounded with high rocks, and accessible to man
or beast only in three or four places.  A person, seeing the
top of these rocks, could never imagine that they surrounded
so great a space of ground In barbarous times, when per-
petual feuds and discords, subsisted between the clans, to such
a degree, that llife and moveable property could not be secure,
when the approach of an enemy was announced, the weakest
of the inhabitants, with all the cattle, were sent into that se-
cret asylum, where strangers could never discover them, with-
out particular information.  It is so capacious as to hold, (but
not to pasture for any length of time) 4000 head of cattle.
It is justly accounted a very great natural curiosity.
