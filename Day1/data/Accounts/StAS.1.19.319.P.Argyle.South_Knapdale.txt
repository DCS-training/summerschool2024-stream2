St Bride might either be one of these miracle-making jug-
glers, which too often disgraced religion; or that her me-
mory has been manufactured by subsequent priestcraft, to 
minister to the occasions of its vanity or its avarice,.
   The collision of opposite doctrines, and the cruelties in-
flicted by the orthodox, previous to the Reformation of re-
ligion, were unknown here.  Motives of interest, as well as
reason, induced our chiefs to become of the Protestant per-
suation, and their example was readily followed by the po-
pulace.  Common sense was insulted by our clergy; but
in no other respect had they injured us.  The case was dif-

wounds were still bleeding, and they were hurried by re-
sentment into excesses, hardly inferior to the abuses they
affected to correct.  it is to our honour that the fame doc-

Catholics in South Knapdale, amounts to no more that one
old woman from Perthshire.
   Extent, etc.-This parish is in length, from south to

situated in the country and synod of Argyle,  and presbytery
of Inverary.  The soil is chiefly of a mossy nature, incum-
bent on a stratum of land;  but in the lower grounds it is
a good loam.  Very little of the parish, however, is arable;
and that which is ploughed or dug with the spade produc-
ces in general so very light crops, that it is reckoned more
profitable to throw it into sheep-walks, or pasture-land for
cattle.  The grains chiefly sown are oats and bear.  Every
