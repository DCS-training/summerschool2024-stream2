rules, in there matters, were found troublesome both to the
teachers and the students.  Hence, attendance at the common
table became a kind of drudgery to the masters, from which
they-endeavoured to escape, or to which they submitted in
their turns with reluctance; while the students procured dis-
pensations, or permissions to have their commons in their
own apartments, This latter was found to be a source of
expence and dissipation, not more unfriendly to literature
than to morals.  The common table, it is said, became a
source of mismanagement and imposition, which could not
easily be remedied.
   This change in the mode of living has been attended with
much comfort and satisfaction to all the members of the
University, by superseding many strict regulations, and of
course rigorous penalties, which, in the former situation,
had been thought necessary: neither has it produced any bad
effect upon the manners and behaviour of the students.  When
teachers are attentive to perform their duty, and discover an
anxiety to promote the interests of their scholars, who are a-
bove the age of mere boys, it requires very little authority to
enforce respect and propriety of behaviour.  The most cer-
tain and effectual mode of discipline, or rather the best me-
thod of rendering discipline in a great measure useless, is by
filling up regularly and properly the time of the student, by
interesting him in the objects of his studies and pursuits, and
by demanding, regularly and daily, an account of his la-
bours.

   Boarding.-In the present state of the University of Glas-
gow, such of the students, as can afford the expence, frequent-
ly live in the families of the Principal anti Professors; where
they have, together with the opportunity of prosecuting their
studies, the advantages of proper society and private tuition.
