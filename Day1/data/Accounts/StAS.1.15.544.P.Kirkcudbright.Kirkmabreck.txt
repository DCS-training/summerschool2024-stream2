the North, Girthon on the East, Anwoth on the South, and
the rivers Cree and Wigton Bay, on the West.

   Surface, Soil, and Produce.-The country in general has
rather a mountainous appearance, rising gradually from the
shore the whole length of the parish; yet the interior part is,
in many places, intersected with rivulets, valleys, and low-
land, which, by the industry of the inhabitants, and being in
the vicinity of such inexhaustable treasures of sea-shells, have
been rendered very fertile, either for producing crops of
grain, or for pasturage.  The lands on the banks of the river
Cree, (which forms Wigton Bay, and is the western bounda-
ry the whole length of the parish) is of a superior quality,
partly of a clay, and partly of a gravelly soil, and, for either
tillage or grassing, is equal to any land in the South of Scot-
land.  The country all along the Bay has a most delightful
appearance, the great military road running along the coast
between Gatehouse of Fleet, and Newton-Douglass, is one
of the most pleasant stages in Scotland, the whole being, di-
versified with woods, gentlemen's seats, and beautiful inclo-
sures, hills gently rising on the one hand, the Bay on the o-
ther, with a full view of the town, and great part of the shire
of Wigton on the opposite side of the Bay, and the Isle of
Man, lying out in St George's Channel; so that, for variety
of objects, so well sitted to please and amuse the fancy, or to
elevate and expand the mind, such a prospect is seldom to be
met with.  The mountainous parts are partly green and
partly covered with heath, or heather, with a mixture of
grass and herbage, that feeds both sheep and black cattle to-
lerably well.  These sheep, which are of the black faced kind,
and of the small breed, are generally esteemed excellent mur-
ton, and when come to age, the wedders generally weigh
