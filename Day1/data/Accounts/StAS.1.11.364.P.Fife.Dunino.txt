school, very fortunately for the health of the teacher, as well
as of those who are taught, is large, and capable of containing
a few more scholars, besides the parochial ones; a great num-
ber of whom commonly attend it.  Besides a very good gar-
den, of 8 by 12 paces, there is a salary of 100 merks
(5 L. 11 s. 0 1/4 d. Sterling) and the session-clerk's fees, which
amount to 2 L. 15 s. 8 d.; with an occasional gratuity of 5 s.
Sterling, at the dispensation of the Lord's Supper, for extraor-
dinary singing.  The fees for teaching are, for English, 1 s. 3 d.;
for reading and writing, 1 s. 6 d.; for arithmetic, 2 s.; and for
Latin, 2 s. 6 d.  Other branches of education are seldom de-
sired; and even the last not very frequently.  Most of the
people have a laudable ambition to have their children edu-
cated; and the payment of the quarter fees is scarcely ever
grudged, though often paid with a good degree of tardiness,
arising from the actual penury of some of the parents.  The
dues on a proclamation of marriage, are 2 s. 6 d. when regu-
lar, one third whereof goes to the beadle; and, when irregu-
lar, or performed in shorter time than the church standards
dictate, an additional gratuity is commonly given by the
employers.  The dues on each baptism are 1 s., of which the
beadle gets 3 1/2 d.; and those on certificates are 6 d. each, of
which the beadle has no share, The session-clerk has also
4 d. each for registrating burials.  His annual income, altoge-
ther, does not exceed 22 L., at an average, one year with ano-
ther.  Such, however, is the liberal provision allotted for the
far greater part of those members of society, from whose ser-
vices must ever, fundamentally, proceed whatever is elegant
and respectable in the lives and manners of their fellow
citizens.
