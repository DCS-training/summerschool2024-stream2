receive a quarterly, and some a weekly allowance, according
as their necessities require.  The fund is managed by the 
clergyman and kirk-session, who being intimately acquainted 
with the circumstances of every poor person in the parish,
are enable thereby to proportion the supply to their wants
and exigencies. 

   This parish affords one, among perhaps many instances in
Scotland, how safely the maintenance of the poor may be left 
to the humane and charitable disposition of the people, and 
how unnecessary it is to call in positive laws to their assist-
ance; for, if such laws provide funds for maintaining the 
poor, they also provide poor for consuming the funds.

   Population.-This parish has much increased in its popula-
tion since the returns made to Dr Webster about 40 years
ago, and it still continues on the increase.  At the above
mentioned period, it contained only 612 inhabitants; where-
as it appears, from a survey made last year, that their number
amounts to 872, whereof 75 belong to the anti-burgher
meetings of Farfar and Dumbarrow.  An abstract of the mar-
riages, baptisms, and burials, for the last ten years, is sub-
joined.
