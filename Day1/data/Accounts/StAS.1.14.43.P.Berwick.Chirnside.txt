     of Chirnside.

the married women, who have children (and most of
them have many), and their care and constant employ-
ment, under the burden of them, are such as to require
only sobriety and industry, on the part of the men, to
bring up their families in a creditable way.  When these
virtues are wanting, or sail in the husbands, and the at-
traction of the ale and dram-houses prevails with them,
their mates, unable to do more, than their accustomed
labour, become depressed; and the more so, because the
visible want or disorder in the house is generally, and
often most unjustly, imputed to them; to which sentence
many of their own sex too readily assent.  From sensi-
bility and dread of this reproach, their spirits subside.
Languor of body and mind seize them.  Various af-
fections unhinge their frame.  They behold their chil-
dren around them, in want of bread, which they cannot
supply.  Their eyes are set dead with the fight.  They
agonize, until they can see no more.  Their offspring
cry to a helpless father; they embrace his knees, when
it is a chance, if he is in a condition to take one of
them into his arms.  Irreclaimable in his vicious ha-
bit, if he lives with them a year or two, they are half
starved, and some of them are sure to drop; and if he
die, which may be better for them, they fall to be main-
tained upon the parish charity.- So woful are the effects
which the intemperate use of spiritous liquors may be
observed to produce in all parishes!
   The salubrious air, from the elevation of Chirnside
Hill, joined with the dry and comfortable houses of the
inhabitants, exempts them from the epidemical diseases
of agues, or intermitting fevers, that formerly prevail-
ed.  Of the putrid kind, there are few.  The most com-
mon complaint is of rheumatism, or pains in the joints
