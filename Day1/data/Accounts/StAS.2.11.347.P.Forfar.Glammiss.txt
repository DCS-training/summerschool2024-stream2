L. 200; but since that time a great improvement has taken place
by draining, subdivision of the lands by stone-dike, and a better
mode of agriculture, all tending to counteract the disadvantages
of a late climate. A few plantations have also been recently made
on this glen. It was anciently the property of the Ogilvies of
Powrie, who had their residence in a castle, now totally demolish-
ed. It afterwards became the property of Graham of Claverhouse.
The last of his family fell, in the Rebellion, at the battle of Kil-
licrankie, and the estate was forfeited; and as it did not hold of
the Crown, it reverted to the Douglas family, who were  the su-
periors.
        Forty years ago, the rental of Rochel-hill was about L. 75,-since
which time great improvements have also taken place, on it, in
building houses, dikes, and drains; and, since March 1833, three
acres of it have been feued at the rate of L. 8 per acre, and fifty
houses built. The village is called Charleston.

                        IV.-INDUSTRY.
        Agriculture, &c.-The mode of husbandry is much the same over
all the parish, embrazing usually about one-half of the arable lands
in grass; and hence a great quantity of cattle are kept, most of
them bred on the spot, and principally the "native Angus"
so well known at Smithfield market and other places in England,
to which a number are sent by the Dundee steamers.
	The short-horned breed have of late also been introduced upon
