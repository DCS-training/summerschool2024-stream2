the character, extent, and other circumstances of the farm. In
agreements as to buildings or repairs, the tenant engages to drive
the materials, such as lime, sand, stones, slate, wood, &c.; and
the landlord pays the building. The same happens in the build-
ing or repairing of dikes. On the whole, the greatest encourage-
ment is held out by every proprietor in the parish to the tenant
to make improvements, and he who does so on the most liberal scale,
not only finds his reward in the return made to him from the improv-
ed state of his farm, but also in the greater readiness of the land-
lord to accommodate him, and to satisfy his reasonable demands.

		V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

   Market-Towns, &c.-The nearest market-town is Lauder; and
another market has been recently opened at Greenlaw,-neither of
which are above seven miles from the farthest part of Westruther.
   The only villages now in the parish are those of Westruther
and Hounslow. The former is of great antiquity; the latter was
erected within these fifty years.
   Means of Communication.-There is no post-office in the parish,
but while the family of Spottiswoode reside in the country, a cou.
rier is despatched daily to the post-office in Lauder, of which ar-
rangement, the parish, as well as the family, receives, the benefit.
The mail-curricle runs every day, and the Edinburgh and Dunse
coach six days a-week, along the great road from Edinburgh to
Newcastle, which passes through Hounslow. This line of road
extends about five miles through the parish. The parish, indeed,
is very well supplied with good roads. There were no roads, except
such as were made by the track, in the year 1745; for a person re-
cently dead remembers well to have seen Sir John Cope's troops
in their flight from Prestonpans, scouring the Harelaw-moor, and
inquiring in what direction Coldstream lay. The road from White-
burn to Kelso was made in 1800; that from Whiteburn to Dunse,
during the subsequent year, by subscription. It may be estimated
