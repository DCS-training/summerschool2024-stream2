town-clerk, gave in the following statement on oath :

        2d, That the burgh has no mortifications (mortirnains.)
        3d, That they have neither foreign nor inland trade; that they
do not vend nor consume French wine, sack, or brandy, except
some few pints of brandy they buy in Glasgow; and that they con-
