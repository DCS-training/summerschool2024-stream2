tic piece of ordnance was, on the 19th April 1754, removed from
Edinburgh Castle to Leith, on its way to the Tower of London.
Her loss is thus `gain recorded by the same poet,--
		"Right seldom am I gi'en to bannin,
		But by my soul she was a cannon,
		Could hit a man had he been stannin
			In shire of Fife;
		Sax lang Scots miles ayont Clackmannin,
			An' tack his life."
	When King George IV. visited Edinburgh Castle, on 22d
August 1822, Sir Walter Scott pointed out to him the spot on the
chief bastion of the old fortress, formerly occupied by Mons Meg,
and earnestly requested that she might again be placed there, to
which his Majesty readily assented. But through petty obstacles,
stated by the official guardians of Meg, that object was not effect-
ed for nearly seven years afterwards.
	"On 9th March 1829, she was, however, brought in so-
lemn procession, to re-occupy her ancient site on the Argyle bat-
tery, escorted by the 73d Regiment, a detachment of artillery-men,
and two troops of dragoons, with thirty gentlemen, in full Highland
costume, at the head of whom was Sir Walter Scott, accompanied
by the greater part of the inhabitants of Edinburgh.*
	Modern Buildings.--The principal modern buildings in this pa-
rish are, Gelston Castle, built by the late Sir William Douglas,
Bart., now the residence of his niece, Mrs Maitland; the Carlin-
wark, built by the late Mr M'Culloch, and belonging at present
to Mr David Hannay; and Daldawn, built by the late proprie-
tor, Captain M'Dougall. The St John's Lodge of Free Masons
have a large hall in Castle Douglas.
	There are three mills in this parish for grinding corn, and one
bone-mill.
