been deeply impressed with the opinion, that they might do incal-
culable good, at a cost altogether trifling, by assisting the poor la-
bourer in the education of his family, and by giving it to be dis-
tinctly understood, that any of their dependents who should ne-
glect to have his children instructed, the means of education being
within his reach, must incur, by such neglect, their serious dis-
pleasure.  Were the education of the families of their dependents
to be thus attended to by the higher classes of society,-were it
made known over an estate for example, that, while the proprie-
tor would willingly give assistance to all that should be ascertained
to stand in need of it, he would positively expect that the children
of every family resident upon his domain should receive the bene-
fit of a thorough grounding in at least the elementary branches of
education, and, more particularly, in the fundamental doctrines
and precepts of our holy religion;-and were he to direct his te-
nantry to keep a watchful eye, in regard to this all important mat-
ter, over their hinds and cottars, that man is but little acquainted
with the state of society in our country parishes, or rather with the
genuine feelings of our common humanity, who could hesitate to
anticipate, that, by the blessing of God upon such an order of
things, it would be attended with consequences of the most benefi-
cial character.  If pauperism is to be traced in too many instances to
the early formation of idle and dissipated habits, we may hold it to
be impossible, on the broad principles of a well-ascertained experi-
ence, that such an order and discipline as that to which we have
adverted, should not exert the most salutary influence in repelling
the inroads of this formidable evil.
