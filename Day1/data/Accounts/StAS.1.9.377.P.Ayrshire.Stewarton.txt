     NUMBER XXIV.

     PARISH OF STEWARTOWN,

     (COUNTY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR,
PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE.)

     By the Rev. Mr THOMAS MAXWELL.

     Name, Extent, Surface, etc.

   THE origin of its name is uncertain.  But it is said to
have taken its rise from some of the Stewart race of
Scottish kings having a residence in it, and the remains of
those houses are still to be seen near the town-It is above
10 miles in length, and in some places about 4 in breadth.
From many places in this parish, there are extensive views
of the Western Ocean, the island of Arran, and Craig of
Ailsa.  The appearance of the country is flat: But there
is a gradual descent from the head of the parish to the sea.
There are no mountains, but small hills in different places,
and some of them are called Law hills, either because that
in old times courts of justice were held upon them, or from
the low or flame raised on them, as a signal of the approach
