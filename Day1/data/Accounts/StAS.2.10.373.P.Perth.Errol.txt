          the round summit of the celebrated Dunsinnan, and on the other,
          by the most copious and majestic of Scottish rivers,-this vil-
          lage, while itself a conspicuous object, is the centre of a rural am-
          phitheatre, which cannot easily be surpassed, either in the large-
          ness of its dimensions, or the gracefulness of its ornaments.  The
          hills now mentioned, besides being finely diversified in their out-
          line, are cultivated almost to their summits; and whether their
          inequalities are thrown into light and shade by the slanting rays
          of the evening sun, while they are clothed in the fresh verdure of
          spring, or whether, under the effulgence of the mid-day beams,
          they reflect the golden tints of approaching autumn, they exhibit
          a scene of peculiar splendour and beauty;-the intermediate val-
          ley, with its many thousands of acres of luxuriant vegetation, skirt-
          ed and studded with the country seats of its proprietors; the still
          broader expanse of the Tay, which washes its southern border,
          and forms the magnificent channel by which its varied and exube-
          rant productions are exported in those vessels which are daily to
          be seen dividing its sparkling waves; the distant sea-port of Dun-
          dee, distinguished alike for its manufactures and its commerce;
          and, more distant still, the ancient and isolated bulwark which
          guards the contracted outlet by which this majestic river empties
          itself at last into the German Ocean.
              Geology and Mineraloqy.-There are only two localities with-
          in the parish, where access has been obtained to the solid strata
          of rocks.  The one is at Murie, about a mile to the west of the
          village of Errol, and the other at Clashbennie, about two miles and
          three quarters west from that village.  The general direction of the
          strata is in both places nearly the same.-the prevailing dip being
          to the south-east, the uppermost strata at an angle of 15&deg; or 16&deg;,
          and the undermost at an angle varying from 20&deg; to 25&deg;.  The
          uppermost strata are those of a coarse limestone quarry at Murie,
          which has long been disused, and which, owing to the small per
          centage of lime which the rock contains, seems not to have been
          used at any time, except as affording a tntgh and durable stone for
          building.  The solid strata at this place have not been pene-
          trated to a greater depth than about 15 feet; but, from comparing
          them with the outgoings of the sandstone strata on which they
          evidently rest, it appears that their whole depth cannot be less
          than 30 feet.  The sandstone here mentioned is of a yellowish
          white colour, pretty fine in the grain but not very hard.  It does                                                      very
          not appear to have ever  been regularly  quarried, and there is a
