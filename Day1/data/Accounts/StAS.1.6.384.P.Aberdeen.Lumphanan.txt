Roman Catholics in the parish.

   Productions.-The number of black cattle is 902, of horses
153, and of sheep 1907.  About 200 bolls of meal, oats, and
bear, may be annually sold out of the parish.  The crops are po-
tatoes, bear, oats, turnips, pease, some lint, but little artificial grass.
No heritors reside here, and we are in the infancy of winter
herding, though there is great occasion for it on many accounts.
Several tenants keep bee-hives; a first swarm sells for about
20 s. sterling; if the summer be favourable, 3 swarms may be
looked for from each hive.-When killed, the best hives
yield from 10 to 12 pints of excellent honey; for which, 3 s. 4 d.
to 5 s. per pint may be gotten.  There is not one third of the land
under culture.  Some industrious tenants have ploughed several
acres from the heath, one 15, and another about 14, acres.  After
ploughing it lies a year unsown; then they take several crops
before it is allowed to rest.  One man affirms that he had for
the first crop from a small piece taken from the muir 8 returns,
or 4 bolls from half a boll, which yielded 3 bolls of meal.  There
are apparently many ridges in the hills not now ploughed.  The
hills are very fit for wood, yet none of them are planted.
Commonty, and the non-residence of heritors, are the causes
of this great defect.  The want of fire wood is every year more
and more felt.  Nay all the ash and plane trees, etc. on some
estates are now cut down; as are likewise the allers that grow
on the burns of Lumphanan, Findrach, and Pool bogg; so that
there are remaining only a few trees in the tenants yards, and
the people are obliged, with a great loss of time, and much
expence, to purchase wood from the neighbouring parishes.

   Advantages, and Disadvantages.-The advantages are an
