ter fed and clothed, than when they resided here.
The number of ploughs in the whole parish, may be about 851
and at the rate of 12 bolls to each plough, there may be about
1000 bolls sown between bear and oats, which may give at
least 4000 bolls increase.  There may be 150, or from that to
200 bolls of potatoes sown or planted, which may give from
15 to 20 bolls of produce each.  They are more cultivated
within these 20 years, and more in the drill way than in for-
mer days, and add much to the food of the common people.
They make, with salted herrings, a cheap and not an unplea-
sant meal for winter.-Notwithstanding our bad weather,
the crops are not much to be complained of; perhaps our soil
and culture rather agreeing with rain than drought.  And
from the herrings that are taken in our bays, the addition to
our food from the more frequent culture of potatoes, the op-
portunities the people have of making money, by the buss-fish-
ing, and the coasting trade of Clyde, with the good sale and
price of cattle, the people, upon the whole, seem more at
ease, and less disposed to complain, than 40 or 50 years ago,
though rents are rising continually, with the continued increase
of the nominal value or price of all kinds of provisions.
   The crops of 1782 and 1783 were, with us, cut down much
greener than usual; but in threshing, and even in milling, there
did not seem so much cause for complaint, as was seared; nay, it
seemed to yield generally above their expectation, and to give
them an opinion, that, before that time, they allowed their
crops to ripen too much.
