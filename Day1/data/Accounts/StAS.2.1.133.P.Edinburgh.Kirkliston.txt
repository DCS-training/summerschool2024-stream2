have taken place in the various manufactures then existing in
the parish. The distillery has disappeared; the skinnery! its
very name is lost, having given the place to the more poetical de-
signation of Laverock dale ; the magnesia manufactory is in
ruins; the noise of the wauk-mill no longer reminds the pas-

pulaton has increased; the rental has improved; and could a little
more of that right-hearted prudence which inclines, and, through
God's blessings enables man to value and steadily comply with the
counsels of heavenly truth, be infused into the bosom of the gene-
rality of the people, they would be blessed indeed.

last being the name of the principal village, and of the parish.
The etymology of the word Liston is uncertain.  There is an  old
tradition, that a large district of country around was, at a remote
period, possessed by a distinguished family of that name, and that
