   Agriculture and produce.-Thus parish, besides supplying it-
self with provisions, exports oats, meal, and barley.  Hemp
and flax are not much cultivated, though more has been
raised of late than formerly; and, in the course of the en-
suing season, a flax-mill is to be erected on the river Cairn.
Oats are sown in March and April, and reaped in Septem-
ber and October.  Barley is sown in the beginning of May.
There are about 72 ploughs in the parish, and chiefly of the
Scottish kind.

   Church.-The money and victual stipend that should be

1649, the church was removed from the lower end of the
parish to near the middle of it, where it now stands.

   School.-There is no legal salary for a schoolmaster in this

about 30 years ago, they divided the annual rent of said
L. 300 amongst three schoolmasters, in the following propor-

they alloted L. 6:10:0; to one in the middle of the parish,
L. 2; to one in the lower end of the parish, L. 6:10:0.
Between 20 and 30 scholars attend the school at the upper

lower end of the parish.  1 s. and 2 d. a quarter is the
fee to the shoolmaster for each scholar learning to read
English, and 1 s. 6 d. for learning arithmetic.  The encou-
