gave many lands; and these, by posterior endowments
made by private persons, and the patronage of about 30
churches, of which the abbot commonly drew the patronage
tithes, or let them in tacks, leaving only the small tithes for
the vicars, composed the abbot's estate.-In fixing the rite of
the abbey, the churchmen, who were good judges, pitched

the county.  It stands on a small eminence overlooking the
town; with a fair prospect of the county, of the Frith of

as the Grampian hills on the north.-There are many springs
of fine water on the east side of the inclosure.  One of these
was brought in lead pipes, parts of which have been lately
discovered in digging, for the service of the house; and the
rest formed a canal which ran through the garden, or close,
as the whole does now.
   The soil is a brown clay of a great depth, covered in most
places with a black mixed earth, which dries immediately af-

   To give some idea of the convent's manner of living,

wedders, 9 score of marts or oxen, besides kain marts and
wedders paid by the tenants; 11 barrels of salmon, 1500
dried killings or cod; and to be consumed and eaten in the
house: 4 score and 2 chaldrons of malt, 30 chaldrons of
wheat, 40 chaldrons of meal; and other provisions in pro-
portion.  This would appear surprising, for I hardly find
