not excelled by any in Britain.  It is commonly observed,
that the coarser the pasture is, the butter is the better and
the richer.  Even the mossy ground, though in appearance
barren, is of great use both for black cattle and sheep.  The
plant, called the moss, rises before any other in the spring,
affords excellent nourishment, and is carefully sought after
by the flocks.  In these coarse lands, there is a constant and
regular successsion of different species of grass, which rise in
their respective seasons throughout the year.

   Soil, Produce, and Cultivation.-The arable land at pre-
sent in tillage lies chiefly on the banks of the rivers.  Many
hundred acres, formerly in tillage, are thrown into pasture
on account of the high prices of sheep and wool.  The soil
of the holm land is excellent.  It is sometimes of a light,
but most frequently of a very deep and fine loam, and
where it is properly cultivated, it produces exceeding good
crops.  Wheat has been sown, and turned out very well.
The ordinary crops are barley, or rough bear, pease, oats,
flax, potatoes.  Turnips have lately been introduced, and
succeeded very well.  Last summer, travellers from Edin-
burgh saw no turnips by the way equal to those on the fields
in this place.  Within these few years, a considerable quan-
tity of grass feeds have been sown, and have produced ex-
cellent crops.  From the nature of the holm land, and situ-
ation of the country, turnips, barley, and grass feeds, suc-
ceded by early oats, will probably be found the best rota-
tion.-The ploughs in use are, the English plough, and
Small's chain plough.  The former, drawn by 4 horses, is
still used by some farmers, though, from the nature of the
land, there can be no doubt that Small's chain plough, with
two horses, would execute the work, and answer the pur-
pose much better.  The ridges are made very narrow, and
