with two feet of good earth, taken from the surface of the ground

commenced their operations has been nearly doubled.
   Fishery.-The salmon-fishery was let for the first time about
fifty years ago, to one tacksman, by the different heritors, whose
lands give them a right to fish in the Clyde. The rent obtained
was L. 30. Immediately afterward, the rent rose till it reathed
L. 326 annually. Since the year 1812, however, it has fallen, so
that for the present lease of three years, the annual rent is only
L. 60.

posed to be annually, as follows:

mont Neilson of Glasgow, was the commencement of a new era in
the iron trade.  Dr Andrew Ure, * a very competent authority,
