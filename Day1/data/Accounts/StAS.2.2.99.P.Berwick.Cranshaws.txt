 
                  PARISH OF CRANSHAWS.

    PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE.

           THE REV. J. H. SIBBALD, MINISTER.

            I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name-Boundaries.-THE name is supposed by some persons
to be derived from the Cranes or Herons, which were formerly nu-
merous in this district; by others it is alleged that Cran in the
name of this parish refers to the cranberry, which is a native of
our hills and mosses. These derivations, however, are quite con-
jectural.
   The parish is intersected by a part of Longformacus; and the
part of it on which the church stands is a five-sided figure or pen-
tagon, measuring nearly two miles in every direction, and conse-
quently giving a surface of about six square miles. It is bounded
generally by the Whitadder on the north and east, and a part
of Longformacus on the south and west. The other part of the
parish is an irregular figures, extending more than five miles in
length by about two of mean breadth. The small river Dye
divides it from Longformacus for four miles on the north side, and
gives its margin an undulating form; the same parish encloses it
on the east and partly on the south, after which the parish of
Westruther completes the southern border, and that of Lauder
the western.
   Topographical Appearances.-The highest land on this side of
the parish is called Man-Slaughter Law, and, according to tradi-
tion, receives its name from having been the scene of a very seri-
ous engagement. There is some reason for believing this report,
as some pieces of warlike weapons have been found in the imme-
diate neighbourhood, and a tumulus, such as was generally used
to commemorate important events, is still remaining upon the
north side of it.
   Meteorology.-Fogs are here sometimes so dense and so regu-
larly spread over all the lower grounds, both in spring and au-
