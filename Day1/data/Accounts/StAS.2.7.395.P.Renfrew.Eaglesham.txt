country has produced. But at present it is our duty not so much
to applaud hi genius, as to state a few statistical facts-all that
can be expected in a limited report. His brother, the Rev. John
Pllok, is now engaged in preparing memoirs of the poet, to be 
published in two volumes; the first volume to contain a life, and
the second, letters, piosthumous poems, and other writings.  Mrs 
Gilmour states that the "Course of Time" emenated from the
exuberant fancy of her brother in about two years; and also that
the poet, about the period of its publication, destroyed all his more
crude and early productions.
   Land-Owners.-Besides the Earl of Eglinton, who is pro-
prietor of nearly the whole of the parish, there are four small
propietors, who hold farms or landed properties to a limited ex-
tent. These are,
   1. Millhall, about one mile south-east of the village. It con-
sists of about ten acres of very fertile land. This small estate
was formerly the property of John Mather, who acquired it by
marrying Mary, daughter of Robert Dunlop of Millhall. It now
belongs to Ludovie Gavin, Esq.
   2. Boreland, about half a mile from thre village of Eablesham,
was bought upwards of 170 years ago from family of the name
of Anderson, and now belongs to William Brown, Esq.   The 
estaten consists of about 40 acres of very good land.
   3. West Muirhouse, the property of William Gilmuir, Esq.
consists of about 250 acres of moorish land, partly cultivated, and 
partly in natural meadow, and unreclaimed heather moss.
   4. East Muirhouse, belonging to James Mather, Esq. consists
also of 250 acres of similar land to the above. Both this and the
former property were purchased, 1742, from Mure of Caldwell.
The following facts as to properties within the parish are from
