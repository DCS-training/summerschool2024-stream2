English names.  Some farms in the upper part of the parish,
which were laid waste, in the bad years, or famine, at the end
of the last century, have had new and fanciful names given

   Stipend.-The stipend (in which are 21 1/2 bolls meal,
reckoned at 10 s. per boll) amounts to L. 71:10.  The glebe,
