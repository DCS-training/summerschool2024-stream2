   Inns, Ale houses, etc.-There are several houses in this pa-

render the communication of this country with the south of
Scotland, and the west and north-west Highlands, easy and
agreeable.  The country roads through the parish were ori-
ginally made, and are still kept in repairs by the statute la-
bour, which is exacted in kind.
