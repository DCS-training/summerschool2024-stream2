ban or sun-fish appear in May, and sometimes remain till
July.  Their liver alone is useful for making oil, some of
them yielding 12 barrels.  This oil is also most frequently
exported to the Clyde market.  Different other kinds of
fishes are caught, of some benefit to the inhabitants; but
it is unnecessary to particularise them here.-The land and
sea birds in this parish are much the same with those in
the neighbouring islands.  Birds of prey are numerous;
grouse are found in Rum and Eigg.  There are some pi-
geons, and a few wild ducks.  The puffins are found in con-
siderable numbers, which, though sea fowls, lay and hatch
sometimes at a great distance from the shore, even near the
tops of high hills.  Their young, before they leave the nest,
are as large as the dam, transparent with fat, and delicious
to the taste of many.  It is believed, that the young puffin
becomes so weighty with fat, as to be unable to take the
wing and leave its nest: To remedy this inconvenience, the
old puffin is said to administer sorrel, to extenuate, and ren-
der it fit for flying.  It is, at any rate, a known fact, that
sorrel is commonly found to grow near the puffin's nest.
There is a small kind of black crow peculiar to Eigg, having
its body, back, head, and neck, of a greyish blue colour, and
seemingly of the size of a pigeon.  In some of the high hills
of Rum, ptarmigans are found.  In respect of size, they are
somewhat less than grouse; and, for security against birds of
prey, they assume the colour of the ground; in cold seasons
they are white as snow; in other seasons they are spotted
white and blue, like the craggy cliffs among which they
live.  Here plovers are not numerous.  There are a few
curlews snipes, and herons, with many other birds, of too
little importance to be severally mentioned.  Our migratory
birds are rails, cuckows, woodcocks, swallows, arctic gulls,
