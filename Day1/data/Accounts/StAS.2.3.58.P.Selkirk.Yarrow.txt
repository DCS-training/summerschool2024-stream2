legends of superstition are in a great measure forgotten, and its
rites forsaken.  There is no longer "heard a lilting at the ewes'
milking," or "The tales at the farmer's ingle."  The minstrel's
strains, however, had lingered long after the deeds which they com-
memorated were over. In this pastoral district it was that Sir
Walter Scott found many of the old balleds which had been handed
down for ages as a patrimony from sire to son.  But, on the pub-
lication of his "Minstrely," the spell that bound them was broken;
and these relics of Border song, thus laid bare to the light of day,
have, like the friendly and familiar spirits of Border superstition,
on being noticed with peculiar kindness, entirely disappeared, and
that, too, in consequence of the very effort made to perserve them.
In this district, too, there existed almost a feudal relation between
master and servant; there being instances in which the domestic has
grown up and grown grey beneath the same roof; but now the half-
yearly term is too often one of change, and the stipulated service
performed with mechanical unconcern.
  The capabilities of improvement in this parish have been for the
most part suggested in the courses of the preceding account.  It may
only now be noticed, that there is still room for one or two more
bridges and for additional roads, communicating with Tweed-side and
along the south bank of the rivers, or at least leading to the farm-
housed placed there.  And farther, were the parish of Meggat dis-
joined from Lyne, the adjacent parts of Ettrick and Yarrow an-
nexed to it, and a clergyman regularly to reside, this would prove
highly beneficial to the people of that sequestered district, and ex-
tend the ministration of an establishment by which, pre-eminently,
"the gospel is preached to the poor."
