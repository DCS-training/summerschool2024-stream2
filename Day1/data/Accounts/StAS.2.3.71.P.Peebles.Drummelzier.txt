                PARISH OF DRUMMELZIER.

PRESBYTERY OF PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE


    THE REV. JAMES SOMMERVILLE,  MINISTER.



       I.-Topogragraphy and Natural History.

   Name and Boundaries.-Mr Welsh, in the Statiscal Account
of 1790, states, that the name signifies in Gaelic "here is a plain."
Mr Chalmers in his Caledonia, derives it from a term signifiying
the inhabited "ridge."
    The figure of the parish is irregular.   The extreme length may
be reckoned fourteen miles, and the average breadth betwixt three
and four.   It is bounded for the most part by the Tweed, and
the mountains rise at a small distance from the river, leaving no
great quantity of arable land, though in different places it spreads
out into very fine haughs.  The population is also chiefly on the
river side.
   Meteorology.-From the height of the parish above the level of 
the sea, the temperature of the air is rather cold.   The prevailing
winds are the west and south-west.     The greatest rains are from
the south and south-west; and though there are very heavy showers
from the west, they are seldom of long duration.   Rain from the
east is not frequent, but when it does take place, generally con-
tinues long.  The air is damp from the neighbourhood of the moun-
tains, though the soil is so dry that the greates rains speedily dis-
appear.    The east wind prevails much in spring, but the eastern
haar is never seen here.   The crops are occasionally so much in-
jured by frost, in late  seasons, as to be unfit for seed.
    Diseases.-The prevailing diseases are fevers and consumprion,
as stated in 1790; but rheumatism, which then prevailed, has
greatly ceased, probably owing to the people being now better
lodged and clothed.  Ague, which appears to have greatly pre-
vailed in the seventeenth century, is now unknown.
   Hydrography.-The only river ub the parish is the Tweed, which
divides it on the upper part, and runs along the west and north sides
