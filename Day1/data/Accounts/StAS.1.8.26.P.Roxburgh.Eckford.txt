at the distance of upwards of 20 miles.  A quarry of lime-
stone has lately been wrought at about half that distance.
The experiment has not as yet been so extensive as fully to
ascertain its excellence for the purpose of husbandry.  The
proprietor (by its demand) has been encouraged to erect a
draw kiln; and as it seems to increase, another kiln is pro-
posed to be built next season.

   Proprietors and Rent.-Property has not undergone any
considerable change of late in this district, excepting Marle-
field, purchased by the Marquis of Tweeddale from William
Nisbet of Dirleton, Esq. along with the estate of Grubbet.
There are 8 heritors in all:  Only one resides constantly, and
another occasionally during part of the summer season.  The
valued rent of the district by the commissioners of supply,
anno 1742, is 1130 L. 13 s. 4 d. Scotch.  The present real
rent is 3699 L. 4 s. 1 d. Sterling.

   Church.-The present church was built about the year
1662.  It was completely repaired and new seated in 1774
and 1775, and is now rendered exceedingly convenient.  The
manse was rebuilt in 1775, and is equally commodious.  The
offices have been lately repaired.  The glebe is rather small,
even including the pasture ground.  Water for the family
use is transported from the river Tiviot in a water carriage,
there being no spring in the immediate neighbourhood of the
house.  Of late, pump wells have been dug in the villages of
Eckford, Wester Moss, and Moss Tower, and some other
places, which supply the inhabitants plentifully with that ne-
cessary article.  The living consists of 35 bolls 3 firlots 1
