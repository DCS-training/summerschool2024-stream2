the vicinity of Roslin and Hawthornden. It was built by the pre-
sent proprietor, being finished so lately as 1844. The building
is of noble dimensions and strikingly elegant appearance. The
style of architecture is of the reign of James VI.: and the erec-
tion is at once a monument of the refined taste of its proprietor,
and the eminent architectural abilities of Wm. Burn, Esq.

deaths, minutes of session, are as follows:-1. Register for the kirk
