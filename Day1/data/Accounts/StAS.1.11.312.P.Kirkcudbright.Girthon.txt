     GATEHOUSE OF FLEET.

   Situation and Origin.-This neat and beautifully situated
village stands to the S. W. of the parish, on the banks of the
Fleet.  Its increase has been rapid.  Though the first house
in it was built as an inn, not above 30 years ago, it now con-

inhabitants, that the superior has signified, that his attention
shall soon be turned to this important object.  It deserves re-
