equal, but the one end of the long beam or first bar always
goes before the other, just as the driver whips up the cattle
on his right or on his left hand.  The driver is in the
middle, and walk backwards all the way, keeping his face
towards the ploughman; whereby, indeed, he has it in his

tenants carry home their peats, and some lead their corn, in

crests called cassies, made very compactly of long oat straw
woven with small twisted ropes of rushes, and fixed over
straw flets on the horses backs with a clubber and straw
ropes.-When a call comes to ship the master's victuals, some
scores of the garrons or small horses above described are
sent out by the tenants, tied to one another by the tail, with
a cassie of meal or bear on either side of every horse.  A
