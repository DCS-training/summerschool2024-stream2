     Name, Situation, etc.
   ACCORDING to a current tradition, Rathen is derived
from Ethernan, the name of an old saint, who is said
to have resided in the parish.-It is three miles distant from
Fraserburgh, extending upwards of two miles along the sea-
coast betwixt that town and Peterhead; from thence it runs
inland, in a south-west direction, to the extent of 7 miles:
The breadth is two miles at an average.  About a third part
of Mormond-hill, (mentioned in the preceding account of
Fraserburgh), is comprehended in the parish; this hill, its en-
virons, and several patches of moss, are good for little except
affording fuel.  The soil, through the rest of the parish, is
very various: There are some deep rich fields; others are
light, and sandy but generally productive under good treat-
ment; and others gravelly and stony, several parcels of which
never have been broken up.  The water of Rathen, or Philorth,
dividing this parish from Fraserburgh, drives several mills;
