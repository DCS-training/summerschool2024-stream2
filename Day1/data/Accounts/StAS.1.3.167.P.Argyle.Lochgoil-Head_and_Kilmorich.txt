another dark cave, nearly of the same dimensions with
the first.  These, and a great many other subterraneous a-
partments, in this parish, were, in former times, often the
residence of a banditti, who committed depredations on the
neighbourhood.  They were also of great service in preser-
ving the deadly feuds, and predatory wars, which prevail-
ed of old in this country.  A few years before the Revolu-
tion, the powerful families of Argyle and Athol were attach-
ed to opposite parties in the state; in consequence of this,
and prompted to revenge by the memory of former injuries,
the vassals of the latter made an irruption into Argyle-shire.
Upon that occasion, the inhabitants of this parish retreated,
with their wives, their children, and the most valuable part
of their portable effects, to their caves, their strong-holds,
and hiding places, from whence they surprised the enemy in
several successful fallies, but could not prevent them from
burning many houses, nor from carrying away and destroying
much cattle.

   Antiquities.-There are three castles in this parish.  The
castle of Dunduramh* is a large and strong tower, of an
irregular figure, with small turrets above the angles in the
wall; but, as it is built in a low situation, it could only be
a defence against the cursory attacks of hostile neighbours,
or of thieves and robbers, who fought for plunder, and,
when repulsed, fled away.  Above the gate of the castle is
the following inscription:

*Donduramb, the Fort of the two Oars.  This castle was built
close to the sea; and, as the access to it by land was in these
times very bad, the most frequent communication would pro-
bably be by boats.
