		     I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name.--THE name of this parish, which is common to no fewer
than five parishes in Scotland, is obviously derived from St Mi-
chael, a saint of great note in the Romish Breviary,--who flourish-
ed in the tenth century.
   Boundaries, Extent.--Its extent in imperial measure is 15,250
acres. Its greatest length is 12 miles; its greatest breadth 5 miles,
6 3/4th furlongs. It is bounded on the north and north-east by Dal-
rymple; on the east by Straiton; on the south by Dailly; and on
the west and north-west by Kirkoswald and Maybole.
   Topographical Appearances.--The character of the parish is
hilly. On the banks of the rivers and streams, there are consi-
derable tracts of level ground; but these bear a small proportion
to what are unequal and undulating. The hill-pasture continues
fresh and green, for most part of the season. In the upland farms,
there is some little heath and moss, but no naked rock. The
ground to the south from the Girvan Water continues to rise,
with some interruptions, till it reaches the hill of Glenalla, which
is 1612 feet above the level of the sea. The eminence above the
farm-house of Guiltree-hill is well worth being visited. On the
one side, are the Galloway and Straiton heights, with the rich
and well-wooded valley of the Girvan; and on the other, are seen,
in still grander outline, the bold peaks of Arran, the bay of Ayr,
and the towns along the coast, with the Highland hills and Ben-
lomond in the distance.
  Climate and Soil.-The climate is similar to that of the districts
situated on the western coast. The wind blows west and south-
west, at least three-quarters of the year; and the rain from the
same quarter is proportionally frequent and copious. It is to this
cause chiefly, that Ireland is indebted for her green fields, and
