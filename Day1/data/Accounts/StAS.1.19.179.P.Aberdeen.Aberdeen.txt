of the high probability of finding employment from some
of the many manufactures carried on in the neighbourhood,
induce many old women, and many of the widows and
daughters of farmers and tradesmen, to leave the country,
and reside in this parish, while their sons have either settled
as farmers in their native place, or gone abroad, or entered
into the army or navy.  If to these observations we add,
that in all parishes, in which there are several large towns
and villages, most families need more female than male ser-
vants, the majority of females in this parish, great as it is,
will be sufficiently accounted for.
   The annual average of baptisms for ten years immediately
after 1722, is 90 6/10; for ten years after the 1752, 89 4/10;
and for ten years after 1782, 124 2/10.  To this average 12

the parish church-yard, 57 5/10 and in the Snow church-yard,
2; for ten years after the 1782, in the parish church-yard,
104 3/10, in the Snow church-yard, 2; and in the Spittal
church-yard, 241 8/10; in all, 348 1/10.
   The average number of marriages properly belonging to
the parish for eight years immediately after the 1722 is,
25 1/10; for ten years immediately after 1752, it is 33 8/10;
and for ten years immediately after the 1782, it is 51.  In
calculating the above average of marriages, those in which

allowance is made for the justice of peace marriages, several
of which annually occur.
   From the above statements of the population of the city
and parishes of Aberdeen, it appears, that the whole in
