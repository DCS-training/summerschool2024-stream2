     of Peterhead.

rotation of crops, I had often observed with surprise, and
had at first set down from recollection, but which I now in-
sert in the words of the tenant, who is still alive, and gave
me the account in writing: "On my farm there was a
"field of four acres, which, for 25 years during my resi-
"dence there, yielded alternately full crops of grain, viz.
"beans, bear, and oats, without any manure; I have rea-
"son to think my predecessor, for 5 or 7 years immediate-

The number of bolls from each acre was never ascertained,
but the field always attracted my attention, as producing
the richest crop in the neighbourhood, before any improve-

   In a word, I am satisfied the greatest part of the parish is
capable of the highest degree of cultivation, and I hope
soon shall arrive at it.
   Sea-sand has only begun to be tried last year; on the
sea-coast, to the northward, for upwards of 24 miles, it has
been used for some time with great success, and is even
preferred to lime; it may truly be called shell-sand, and is
more calcareous than what is found on the shore in this
parish.
   It is not possible to ascertain the precise quantity of grain
raised in this parish; I am apt to think it is not sufficient
for the subsistence of the inhabitants.
   Gardening is in its infancy, and is making very slow
progress.
   Considerable attention is paid to the dairy by several
persons in the parish, though in general little attention is
paid to the breed of the cows.  There are a few of an ex-
cellent shape, and they give large quantities of milk, from
8 to 12 pints each.  Six pints, I am apt to think, is more
than the average from the cows in the parish.  There is
butter and cheese of an excellent quality, the butter gives
from 6 d. to 8 d. the lb. 20 ounces Dutch, or nearly 22
