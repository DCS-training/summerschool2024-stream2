     of Perth.

   In the year 1794, died 94 men; 141 women; 129 boys;
121 girls; 34 still born.  Total 519.
   I reckon the burials in the year 1793, to be the average
number.  Therefore, 641, multiply by 31, makes the num-
ber of inhabitants in the town and parish of Perth, to be
19,871; which falls short of the calculation made of the

   Formerly, while the town was surrounded with high walls
and towers, and water trenches, the air of it might not be

south, by which a free air circulates through the town.
   There are no diseases peculiar to the parish of Perth; and
the town enjoys this singularity, that none of its inhabitants
are seized with the ague, of which the natural cause may be,
that the town is well sheltered from the east wind by the op-

   I am informed that the aged rector of the grammar school,
Mr Alexander Watson, who has for some years retired from
business, has frequently said, that during the 40 years in
which he taught the school, there were some of the scho-

of them make a shift, perhaps for 3 years, to maintain them-
selves, and then when they fall into distress, or their cart
horses die by which they gained their daily bread, they apply
to the public for relief.
   The inhabitants in general, are charitably disposed.  Be-
