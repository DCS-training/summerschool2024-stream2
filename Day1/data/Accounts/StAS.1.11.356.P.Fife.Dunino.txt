To the pond below there is no access, but up either side of
the headlong current, overhung by rocks, some of them im-
minent and dreadful; while the immediate entrance to the
pond is narrowed, by the seemingly artificial and mutual pro-
jection of two rocks, erected in the form of posts, destined for
