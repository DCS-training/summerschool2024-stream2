two maintain the poor in such a way as not only to be free
of complaint, but to give full satisfaction to themselves, and
to those who live around them.  If any happen to be whol-

dertaking the care of them.  There are two stated meetings,
at Whitsunday and Martinmas, for the purpose of fixing the
rates of the following half year, and for purchasing clothes.
There is no great danger of imposition, as the poor must have

elders in each quarter, by converting with neighbours, and
by their own observation, are able to form a pretty just
judgment of their necessity.

71 years ago, indifferently executed at first, in a low situation,
has been often repaired at a considerable expence, and now
is in bad condition.  The stipend is about 61 L. with a glebe
worth about 7 L.: but a process of augmentation is now
depending.  The Crown is patron.
