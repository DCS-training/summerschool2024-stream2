     of Forfar.

   Rivers and Lakes.-There are no rivers in the parish, and
scarce any stream that deserves the name of a burn.  Two
trouting-rivers Lunan and Venny, indeed take their rise in
this parish but are both inconsiderable rills in so far as connected
with it.  Such is the scarcity of water, that of 8 mills in the pa-
rish, six are driven by water collected from small springs which
in summer to little execution, one is driven by wind, and
another by a horse.
   There were before the draining, three lakes in the parish,
Forfar, Restenet, and Fithie; all abounding in pike, perch and
eel; and since a communication has been opened by a drain
between the Loch of Forfar and the river Dean, trout of a
considerable size are sometimes taken; but none of these fish
have been brought to market except eels, which some time a-
go were exposed in great numbers, taken in an ark at the out-
let of Loch-Restenet.
   The loch of Forfar, upwards of 20 years ago, was drain-
ed of about 16 feet perpendicular depth of water.  About a
mile in length and a quarter of a mile in breadth, of various
depth, (from 2 to 22 feet in summer), still remains.  No
arable land has been gained by this draining, but a very consi-
derable quantity of moss and marle.  A cubic yard and an half
of solid moss is supposed to produce a cart load of peats, valu-
ed, as they lie upon the bank, from 8 d. to 1 s.  To this the ex-
pence of digging, drying, and leading must be added to make
the full price, and that will be little short of the prime cost.
Those who dig and dry them for sale, usually charge the people
in Forfar half a crown for a small cart load of dried peats laid
down at the door.  The boll of marle, consisting of 8 cubic
feet, brings 8 d. to the proprietor, out of which he pays 1 d. for
digging or 1 1/2 d. for dragging; for they not only dig for the
marle at the recovered land, but heave it from the bottom of
the lake by a machine, such as is used for clearing the channel
