     of Kilmaronock.

men are, in general, employed in husbandry; but, as the
farms are small, they are not oppressed with hard labour.
The women are engaged in spinning flax, or in work they
receive from manufacturers.  The people are grave and sober;
but some of them are rather disposed to be litigious*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*About the beginning of the present century, the parish was much exposed
to the depredation of certain freebooters, who carried off the cattle; so that the
farmers, for their protection, engaged to pay them, or others, a certain tax, named
black meal, which was regularly exacted until 1745, when a better police was
established.
