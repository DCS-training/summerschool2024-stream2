mountains.
   It is called, in public registers, the parish of Urquhart and
Glenmoriston, though no evidence appears of an annexa-
tion or union to ascertain whether or not they formerly
were distinct parishes.  It is probable, however, that they
were so in times of Popery.

   Etymology.-Nothing satisfactory can be determined re-
specting the etymology of Urquhart; and though the valley,
in general, be so styled, there is no particular place or farm
called Urquhart.  There are two other parishes of the same
name, the oen in Ross-shire, and the other in Moray.  In
Gaelic, the general language of the country, Urquhart is
pronounced Urcbudinn, and this was formerly distinguished by
the name of Urchudin Cill ma  Chrossan, as being the residence
of Saint Crossan of Crostan; latterly, it is more frequently
styled Urcbudin Tbiarna Gbrant, or the Laird or Grant's
Urquahart, by much the larger part of the valley having
been, for some ages, the property of the family of Grant.
But though the etymology of Urquhart be undertain, it is
abundantly evident, that the names of all the places are
pure Gaelic.  Cill, in its original acceptation, denoted a
cell, or the sequestered habitation of religious person; and
from the circumstance, that the people, from reverence to
the residence of a saint, buried the dead near his habitation,
cill came to signify, in the common language of the people,
a church yard or burial place.  There is in the valley of
Urquhart two burial palces; the one called Cillmore, or the
Great Burial Place; it is at the lower end of the valley,
where the parish-church stands:  The other place, still used
for sepulture, is at the head of the valley, in Corrimony;
