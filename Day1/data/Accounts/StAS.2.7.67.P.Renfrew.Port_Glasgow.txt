provident as they are industrious, the evils of pauperism would be
confined within very narrow and manageable limits indeed.

                    IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Manufactures.-The Gourock Rope-work Company have long
had a branch of their establishment here, for the manufacture both
of rope and sail-cloth. The canvas factory, which has of late
been considerably enlarged, gives employment at present to about
200 Men, at 12s. a-week, and 81 boys, at 3s. 6d.; and 71 women,
at 4s. 6d., and 67 girls, at 3s. 6d. In the rope-work department,
45 men are employed, each receiving 15s. a-week, assisted by a
number of boys. In both, the number of workers amounts to 474,
male and female.
   There are at present only two houses actively engaged in the
business of sugar-refining. The one, on a comparatively small scale,
in which the old process of making refined sugar is adhered to.
In the other, which is of large extent, the new system of refining.
by steam is followed. In connection with these, about 50 men are
regularly employed within doors, whose wages va ry from 12s. to,
L.1, 10s. per week.
   Ship-Building.-The work of ship-building is carried on here to
a considerable extent. Of late years the carpenters have been
chiefly employed in the construction of steam-boats, of which they
have produced a great number, some of them of the largest class,
and all of them of very superior workmanship. At present this de-
partment of maritime industry gives employment to nearly 200 men,
at the rate of about L. 1 or L. 1, 1s. a-week, besides a number of
apprentices.
   Trade.-Vast improvements have in the course of the last few
years been effected, in deepening the river, and otherwise increas-
ing its facilities of navigation. These, as was to be expected, have
proved injurious to the commercial interests of the outports on' the
Clyde. In the year 1811, the coasting trade of Port-Glascow
employed 400 vessels. and 1300 seamen. Owing to the. facility,
with which vessel of inferior burden find their way up the river,
nearly, the whole of this portion of the trade has been transferred
to Glasgow.  The foreign trade of this port may be estimated by
the following table for the year 1834. The arrivals during that
year were the following:
