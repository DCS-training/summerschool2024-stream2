  No peers are landholders in this parish ; the landed proprietors
are 13, and most of them resident. All their rentals are above
L.50 a year.

the whole, they are contented and respectable, and it is hoped
their character is improving. In particular, illicit distillation, for-
merly the bane of the district, has entirely ceased.

centuries to substantial burghers of that town, who, while they
