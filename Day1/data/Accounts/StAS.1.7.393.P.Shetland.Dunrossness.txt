lead, and iron, samples of which were carried to London,
particularly of copper, in considerable quantity.

   Agriculture, Cattle, and Sheep.-The lands are reckoned by
a peculiar measurement, by what are called merks-land.-Each
merk-land ought to contain 1600 square fathoms.  To each
one cow is allotted; and the parish contains 2000 of these
merk-lands, and consequently as many cows.  In Sandwick
and Cunningsburgh, the farmers plough chiefly with oxen,
and at Ness with horses; 4 oxen or 4 horses in a plough,
which go all abreast; but the ground is chiefly laboured with
spades of a light kind; with these, 5 or 6 men and women,
will turn over as much land in a day, as a Scotch plough
with 8 or 10 oxen.  The oxen, with the young cattle, are
about 1000.  The parish of Dunrossness, having more arable
and less pasture ground than the neighbouring parishes, the
number of sheep is, of course, smaller than in the other di-
stricts.  It was, however, considerable, till within these few
years; a large English scabbed ram was imported into this
district, which infected the flock to which he was brought,
and the infection has spread among the sheep through the
whole parish, notwithstanding every precaution and effort of
the farmers to prevent it.  In consequence of this unhappy
circumstance, the whole number of sheep in the united pa-
rishes of Dunrossness Sandwick, and Cunningsburgh, does
not now exceed 5000.

   Birds.-Eagles, hawks, ravens, etc. are so numerous, as to
make havock of the lambs and poultry, insomuch that the
commissioners of supply give a crown for every eagle that is
destroyed.  Swans in great numbers resort to this parish in
October and November, and remain about the lochs of Skel-
berry and Scousburgh during the winter.-In the end of A-
