the river Don, which takes its rise among the hills in the 
head of the country, and runs through the parish from W. 
to E. dividing it nearly into 2 equal parts.  This parish 
formerly went by the name of Invernochtie.  It was so 
called, from the kirk's being built near to the place where 
the small river Nochtie falls into Don.  Besides these, there 
are 5 or 6 lesser river or burns, which flow from the sur-
rounding mountains, in different directions, and fall into 
Don in its course through the parish.  These are separated 
from each other by considerable hills; most of them run 
through deep hollows or glens.  The ground on both sides 
of these rivulets, in general, as well as on each side of 
Don, where there are also some considerable haughs, rises 
gradually towards the hills; and for some distance from 
their banks, a considerable part of it is arable, about 2 
miles up from the places where they respectively join with
Don.  All these rivers and burns abound in excellent trout. 
Salmon also are very frequently found in Don, towards 
the lower end of the parish.-The general appearance of 
the country is hilly.  The hills are mostly covered with 
heath.  The afford very wholesome pasture for sheep, and 
most of them abound in game.  The hills of Curgarff in 
particular are famous for this production; and in the sea- 
son, are generally resorted to by sportmen from various 
parts of the kingdom.  The soil, as may be supposed, in 
so large a tract of country, is various.  The greater part 
of it is light and sharp; and when properly managed, is 
fertile enough.  In the highest parts of the parish, it is spun-
gy, or a blackish colour, inclined to moss. 

   Agriculture.-The ordinary crops are bear and oats,
some rye, with a mixture of oats, and a few peace.  When 
the weather will permit, (which has not been the case for 
same years past), the seed-time is begun about the 20th of
