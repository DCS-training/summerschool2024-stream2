were 38 births that year.  The population of the parish has
been since decreasing, until 1768, when the first printfield
was erected.  There were only 27 births that year, and, by
a list of the inhabitants, taken in 1769, the population was
about 640 above 6 years of age.  It has varied since 1768,
according to the briskness or dulness of manufactures; and
therefore, if the list of the inhabitants had been taken dur-
ing the summer, the population would have been about 100
souls more than are above stated.

   Professions.-Of the above number there are 993 employ-
ed by the three printfields, whereof 507 are women; besides
67 boys and girls under 10 years of age.  It is not easy to state
the number employed at the bleachfields, as it varies so much
at different seasons of the year Besides these, there are 7
smiths, 15 shoemakers, 12 taylors, 21 wrights, and 6 millers
of different kinds; 2 distillers, 4 excise officers, 8 shopkeepers,
and 14 keepers of alehouses.

   Manufactures.-Some peculiar excellencies in the water of
Leven, have encouraged several manufacturers to settle in
this parish.  The Leven is remarkable for the softness of its
water, which fits it, in a peculiar manner, for the purposes of
bleaching.  It is seldom or never muddy, as the rivers and
burns, from the Highland hills, fall first into Loch-Lomond,
where the mud they carry along with them subsides.  It is not,
therefore, subject to the sudden risings and fallings which
most other rivers are liable to.  By gradually rising and fal-
ling, it is fitted for the different kinds of machinery, which
are so convenient and necessary for carrying on the manu-
factures.  There are at present 3 printfields, and 4 bleach-
fields in the parish.  The duties paid to government from
them for one year, ending 5th July 1790, amounted to
