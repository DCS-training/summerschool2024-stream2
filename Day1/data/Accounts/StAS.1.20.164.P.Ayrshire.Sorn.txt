dreary and uncomfortable.  In a soil and climate where
roads and shelter were peculiarly necessary, not a single
road or hedge, and very few trees, were to be seen.  Not
discouraged by these unfavourable circumstances, she deter-
mined to create a scene more congenial to her own taste,
and more like the scenes to which she had been accustomed
in a better country.  Accordingly, her skill and activity
gradually produced an agreeable change.  Beside enlarging
and improving the garden and orchard, she subdivided an
extensive farm which she occupied herself, enclosed it with
hedges and hedge-rows, and interpersed it with helts and
clumps of planting.  Through the whole extent of her
farm, she likewise adorned the banks of the river and of the
rivulets, with walks and plantations of various kinds of
trees.  These operations she herself carefully superintended,
and many both of the fruit and forest-trees were actually
planted and pruned with her own hands, and still remain
stately and pleasing monuments of her laudable industry.
These, her useful labours, did not pass unrewarded.  When
she first settled in this country, her constitution and health
appeared to be entirely broken; but, in the course of her
rural occupations, these were gradually re-established, inso-
much that, during the last 50 years of her life, she enjoyed
an uncommon share of health and cheerfulness.  After an ill-
ness of a few days, she died on the 3 d of April 1777, re-
gretted by her friends and the industrious poor, to whom
she had so long been a benefactor.  Had she lived till the
4th of September the same year, she would have completed
the 100th year of her age.-While I walk through the
scenes which her taste adorned, and under the shade of the
trees which her hands planted, I feel a peculiar pleasure in
paying thin little tribute of respect to her memory.
