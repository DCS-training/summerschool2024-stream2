but both have been repaired since, and are at present

   School.-For several years past, the school has been in a
flourishing condition.  The schoolmaster has 200 merks of
salary, with a house and garden.  The rate of education
per quarter is, English 1 s. 6 d.; writing 2 s.'; arithmetic
2 s. 6 d.; and Latin 3 s.  The number of scholars within
the parish is from 60 to 70; and of boarders, at L. 20 per
annum, from 10 to 15.  The schoolmaster's living, exclu-
sive of the profit arising from his boarders, is about L. 40
yearly.

   Poor's Funds.-There are in this parish two considerable
mortifications in favour of the poor.  In 1615, James Mar-
quis of Hamilton, in conjunction with Mr John Howison,
minister of Cambuslang, mortified a sum of money, the
yearly interest of which was directed to be employed for
maintaining in an hospital at Hamilton, 8 poor men, 2 of
whom were always to belong to the parish of Cambuslang.
Gabriel Hamilton, of Westburn, in 1700, mortified 600
merks, the interest of which was to be laid out in buying
shoes and hose to the indigent.  Besides these mortifications,
the poor's stock amounts to L. 350; the interest of this
stock, with the ordinary collection on Sundays, and mort-
cloth dues, which may be about L. 15, yield a sum sufficient
without any assessment, to supply the wants of the poor.

   Population.-The state of population for the last 46
years, may be exactly ascertained by the report made to
Dr Webster in 1755, and by three separate lists taken by 
the present incumbent:
