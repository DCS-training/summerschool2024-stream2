meal, wherever he found it of the best quality, and most rea-
sonable, and to retail it at prime cost, among the parishioners.
By these means all were regularly supplied, below the retail
price, till that was reduced from 2s. 10d. to 2s. 2d. per stone.
By this plan, the town lost only the interest of the L. 50, and

and the terms at which it can be purchased.  --In this parish
there remain no monuments of antiquity, but some military
stations, and a foffee perfectly visible on both sides of the Yar-
