De Foe found him about Wapping, and out of his story constructed
Robinson Crusoe, the most entertaining and popular of all adven-
tures. Alexander brought home the gun, sea-cbest, and cap which
he had with him on the desolate island, returned to sea after nine
months, and was never heard of again.
  The late Sir John Leslie was born in this parish in 1766, of respec-
table parents. He discovered an early predilection for mathematical
and physical science, having with little aid qualified himself, in his
thirteenth year, for the senior mathematic class in the University
of St Andrews. In 1784, he entered as a student of Divinity at
Edinburgh, but soon gave up all thoughts of the church as a pro-
fession, and devoted an interval of several years to private teach-
ing, travelling and writing for periodical publications of the day.
Becoming well known by his differential thermometer, completed in
1794, by his essay on Heat, published in 1804, and by other works
published in Nicolson's Journal, and the Transactions of the Royal
Society of London, he was elected Professor of Mathematics in the
University of Edinburgh, in 1805; in 1809, Professor of Natural
Philosophy; and in 1820, Corresponding Member of the Institute
of France. He contributed largely to the new edition of the Encyclo-
pedia Britannica; and in that, was published his last and best pro-
duction, "The Progress of Mathematical Science in the eighteenth
century." In 1832, he was created a Knight of the Guelphic Order,
and in tbe November of that year he died, leaving tire impress of
his vigorous and original genius, whatever may be thought of his
theories and reasonings, on his admirable instruments and experi-
mental labours.
