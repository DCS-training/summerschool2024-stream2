was erected two years ago by Mr Gordon of Kincardine, who,
since be bought the property about twenty-five years since, has
also built a very handsome and commodious inn in the village.
The mansion-house of Learney was burnt by accident about four
years ago, but is again built in a handsome and modern style.
The only other modern building in the parish proper to be no-

Stranduff.
   The mills in the parish are all now on an improved construc-
tion, particularly one on the estate of Learney, and another on that
of Mr Davidson of Mill of Kincardine. These two are very effi-
cient, and give great satisfaction.

tivation, which was formerly in small patches, has been seen, within
the period alluded to, to extend to great breadths and in regular
fields.  Within that period, poor and uncomfortable cottages, in
