     of Aberdeen.

it abounds in stone-quarries, there are no projecting rocks of
any magnitude.  The town itself, which is about a mile
from the sea, stands mostly on four little hills, gently rising
from the river, to wit, Castlehill, St Catharine's hill, Port-
hill, and Schoolhill.
   The ground westward rises, for a considerable way, by a
very sensible, though easy ascent.  A great part of the
Grampian mountains is in view.  They run across the
whole country, their direction being from north-east to
south-west.  The Tulloe-hill, on the south side of the river,
in the parish of Nigg, may justly be considered as the ter-
mination of that tract of mountains on the ear towards the
German ocean.  This hill is covered with short heath and
loose stones; and has on it an eminence called the Kairn of
Loarstone, which fronts the town on the south.  The high-
er and more distant Grampians, on some of which are huge
rocks, are chiefly covered with heath and mosses.  The
Stocket, or high ground west of Aberdeen, already men-
tioned, was, not many years ago, covered with stones and
heath, but is now converted into rich fields of grass and
corn.
   The soil, in this neighbourhood, is naturally rather bar-
ren and thin, being mostly gravel and sand; but by means
of the manure constantly furnished by of populous a city,
is rendered, in a considerable degree, both deep and fertile.
Some places abound in clay, and in others there is plenty
of black earth.-The air is commonly sharp, dry, and
healthy, as may reasonably be expected from the exposure
and situation of the town.  The wind, from whatever quar-
ter it blows, has a free circulation.  There is not, however,
in this respect, a perfect equality in all parts of the town.
In those on the east side, which are most exposed to the sea
air, there is greater dampness, and a flower vegetation in
the gardens.
