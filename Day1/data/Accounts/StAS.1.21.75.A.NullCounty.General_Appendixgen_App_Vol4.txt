   The deaths in the year- 1792 encreased about one fourth of
our average number; but in the One immediately preceding,
amounted even to more than double.  This uncommon mortality
was chiefly owing to an epidemical sore throat; the fatal issue
of which, I have reason to believe, might, in several instan-
ces, have been prevented by proper care.
   On this occasion, I cannot help observing, that one of the
greatest evils under which the country people labour is, the
want of proper medical assistance.  Though this, I believe,
has been long and generally acknowledged, yet the only re-
medy for it I recollect ever to have heard proposed was, to
oblige every student of divinity to devote some part of his
time to the study of surgery or physic.  As some strong ob-
jections may be made to this, I beg leave to ask, Would it be
practicable to establish in every three or four parishes, situat-
ed beyond a certain distance from any town or considerable
village, a regular bred surgeon and man-midwife?  I should
be glad you found the query not altogether unworthy of
your attention.
