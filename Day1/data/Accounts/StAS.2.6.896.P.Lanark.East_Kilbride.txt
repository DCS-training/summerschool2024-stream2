   The above table may be relied upon as conveying accurate in-
formation.  It gives the wholesale prices, and the person who drew
it up keeps a general shop for selling these and other articles in
retail.  He assures me that his purchases were made within the
parish.
   "Insurmountable obstacles," says Mr Ure, at the commence-
ment of his fourth chapter, "both from the soil and climate, will
always obstruct agricultural improvements in this parish."  These
insurmountable obstacles have, however, in the course of the last
forty years, been surmounted in a great degree.  I am informed
that the effect of the improvements has been such as to make
both seed-time and harvest earlier on an average than formerly.
The extent to which the draining of land has advanced in East
Kilbride, within the last twenty years, is highly creditable.  In-
deed,  sixty years ago, Mr Reid of Castlehill had set a praise-
worthy example in this respect.  But it was not till within the
last fifteen years, that it was generally followed.  At a period from
twelve to fifteen years ago, the parish of Kilbride was found tak-
ing the lead of all the neighbouring country in the improvement of
land by draining.  The exertions which its heritors and farmers
then made, operated as an incitement to those of other parishes,
to adopt a similar course.  It may now be affirmed that, in most of
the farms in the lower part of the parish, nearly the whole land
has undergone the process.  It is considered by competent judges
here, that, in order to drain properly, there must be a fall of length
in the drain for every square fall of ground that a field contains.
Different opinions prevail among the farmers as to the best modes
of draining.  Some approve of furrow-draining, while others prefer
