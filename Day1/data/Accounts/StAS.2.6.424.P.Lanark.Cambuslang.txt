	Zoology.--Of the hawk tribe the following are occasionally observ-
ed. Falco pereqrinus, peregrine falcon; Falco Tinnunculus, kestril;
Falco AEsalon, merlin; Gyrfalco candicans, seen at Dechmont, 10th
May 1835. Circle is cyaneus; Buteo vulgaris, buzzard; Buteo Nisus,
sparrow-hawk. The long horn-owl, the short horn-owl, the barn-owl,
and the ivy-owl, also occur. Motacilla boarula, or grey wagtail is fre-
quently seen in the summer season, and builds on the shelves of
rocks near the water-courses. A bittern (Ardea stellaris) was late-
ly shot in this neigbbourhood, and is now in the possession of Mr
Grimson, Hamilton. No species of woodpecker was ever observed
in this district till within these few months, when two specimens of
the great spotted woodpecker, Picus major, were shot, and both
Preserved by the individual above alluded to. The squirrel, which
was formerly a stranger in these parts, has of late become common
throughout all the wooded districts of Clydesdale. These altera-
tions in the habitats of animals may probably be owing to increase
of plantations, and the superior cultivation of the soil.
	Among the Mollusca, the following may be given as a specimen:

	Arion ater,                      Pupa pygmea,
	Limax cinereus and agrestis,     Carychium minimun,
	Helix ericetorum,                Balea perversa,
        H. rufescens,                    Clausilia perversa,
        R. nemoralis,                    Limnea palustris,
	H. nitida,                       L. fossaria,
	H. rotundata,                    L. limosa,
	H. costata,                      Physa fontinalis,
	H. arbustorum,                   Plarnorbis albus
	Bulimus obscurus,                P. nitidus,
	Vitrina pellucida,               P. complanatus.
	Pupa muscorum,                   Valvata piscinalis.
	The Hydra viridis or green polype is very common in many of
the streams and stagnant ditches in this neigbourhood. The best
way of procuring them is to pull some aquatic plants growing be-
neath the surface of the stream or ditch where they are produced,
and to place them in a basin of pure water, when this curious zoo-
phyte will soon become apparent. It is of the size of a pin's head,
and has the faculty of withdrawing itself from the vegetable surface
to which it is attached by its tentacula or roots, and either moving
or swimming about among the plants and in the water. They catch
their prey with their arms, which they expand or contract at pleasure,
and are invested with the power of voluntary motion.
	Boyaby.--The Chara vulgaris is common in the Clyde at
Bogle's-hole ford, and at Kenmuir. The Chara flexilis or smooth
