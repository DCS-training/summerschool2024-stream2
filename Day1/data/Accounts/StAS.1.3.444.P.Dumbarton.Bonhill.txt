ing into the river early in the season, is uncertain.  When
the season is mild, there are salmon in the river in the end
of December.  The greatest number is taken in the months
of March and April.  The largest salmon ever taken in the
Leven weighed 45 lib. troy weight.  The salmon fishing in
that part of the Leven which lies in the parish of Bonhil,
rented, about 50 years ago, at 300 merks.  The last lease was at
the rate of 150 L. Sterling.  This rise of rent has not been ow-
ing to the increase of salmon in the river; but has principally
arisen from two causes, the great rise in the price of salmon,
and the greater attention that has been paid to the fishery,
with the improved methods which have been adopted.  The
price of salmon here depends upon the Edinburgh and Glas-
gow markets.  In the beginning of the season, or before the
first of May, a considerable quantity are sent over land to
Perth, and from thence to London.

   There is at present a law suit depending about the right to
the trout fishings in the Leven.  The question is, whether a
character from the Crown, granting the salmon and other fishings
in the Leven, gives an exclusive right to the trout fishings?  Or
whether trouts are to be reckoned among the res nullius, or
to be considered as annexed to land, and that every proprie-
tor has a right to the trout fishing opposite to his property?  

   Population.-The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, was 901
souls.  From a list of the inhabitants, taken in January 1791,
it appears that they amounted to 2310 in all.  Of that num-
ber there were 562 under 10 years of age.  In the year 1790,
there were 82 births, 47 burials, and 21 marriages, whereof
there were only 9 instances, in which both parties belonged 
to the parish.  There is an imperfect record of births, as far
back as the year 1677, from which it appears, that there
