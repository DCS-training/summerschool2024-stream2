                 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
                ON THE COUNTY OF NAIRN.

  This small county is included between the shires of Inverness and
Moray. It is bounded on the west by the river Nairn, and on the
east by the river Findhorn. The river Nairn takes its rise in the
eastern part of Inverness-shire, deriving its sources from numerous
small streams that issue out of Loch Clachan, as also from the
waters of several small lakes to the eastward of Lochness. The
river then takes a northerly direction, flowing through Strath Nairn,
till it discharges its waters into the Moray Frith.
   South-east of Strath-Nairn, and lying in a parallel direction, is
this valley of Strathdern, through which flows the Findhorn, which,
among its other tributaries, receives a stream issuing from Loch
Moy. The upper portion of the country is hilly and composed of
gneiss and granite rocks; the lower valleys are occupied by the
old red sandstone, and are of a more fertile nature. The banks of
tire Findhorn are highly picturesque, and beautifully clothed with
wood.
   Nairn is the chief and only town of the county. The length
of the county from north to south is 22 miles, and from east to
west 15 miles, including an area of 200 square miles, or
128,000 acres, of which about 30,000 are under cultivation. It
contains a population, according to the census of 1841, of 9218.
The parliamentary constituency amounts to 118 voters. The an-
nual value of real property, as assessed in 1815, amounted to
L. 14,902.
