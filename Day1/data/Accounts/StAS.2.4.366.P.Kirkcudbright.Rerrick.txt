                                III.--POPULATION.
	Although population is generally stationary in parishes so
purely agricultural and pastoral as Rerrick, there appears to have
been a gradual and progressive increase in the number of in-
habitants during the last half century. The return to Dr Web-
ster in 1775 was only 1051; and it is stated in the former Sta-
tistical Account, published in 1794, that the population of the
parish was then nearly the same. But the more recent Parlia-
mentary returns exhibit the following results :--

<TABLE>
               In 1801, the population was 1166
                  1811,                    1224
                  1821,                    1378
                  1831,                    1635
                  1831,                    1692
	As to the general character of the inhabitants of the parish it
seems sufficient to repeat the kindly language of their late minis-
ter, who knew them well. "The people here," says Mr Thom-
son in the former Statistical Account, " are peaceable, humane,
and hospitable, have a lively sense of decorum and character, and
many of them give indubitable proofs that their minds are deeply
imbued with rational piety." This was the character of the peo-
ple of Rerrick in 1794, and at the distance of half a century, they
have in no respect forfeited their claim to it.

                              IV.--INDUSTRY.
	Agriculture.--The parish of Rerrick contains about 20,447
acres, standard imperial measure. Of these, 13,088 acres have
been at one time or other under cultivation, while 6798 acres
have never been cultivated, or otherwise used than as pastures.
The remaining 561 acres are under wood, natural or planted.
of late years agriculture, properly so called, has not been ex-
tending in the parish ; and, on the contrary, many of the finest
farms have been laid down in permanent grass. In this way,
black cattle may be considered as truly the staple commodity of
the district, by which the farmer pays his rent and makes his
livelihood.
	Rent of Land.--The real rent of the parish somewhat exceeds
L.10,000 a year. In the poorer districts, the average rent of
the Scotch acre runs from 15s. to 25s., but the rich old grazing
of Dundrennan and Netherlaw yield a much higher rent. There
are three corn mills in the parish, which appear to be amply suf-
ficient for the purposes of the farmer.
