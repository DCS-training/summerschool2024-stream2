     Statistical Account

   Miscellaneous Observations.-We have in general good
materials for making roads, but the statute-labour, which
is partly commuted, and partly paid in kind, is not suffi-
cient for keeping them in repair.  I am persuaded we never
shall have good roads till turnpikes are established.  Many
of the country gentlemen are, I believe, sensible of this;
but the measure would be strongly opposed by the town of
Aberdeen, which would be severely affected by it, and which
has an interest in the parish.-There are several very
large cairns, both on the north side of the river, and towards
the coast, and in one place in particular, a number of small-
er ones are scattered over the moor near them.  There is
also in the south side of the parish, a Druidical temple the
is worthy of notice.  It is situated on an eminence about
a mile and a half from the coast, and was till within these
few years remarkably perfect.  It consisted of three circles
of stones within each other.  The outer circle, which was
about 45 feet in diameter, consisted of 12 large  stones placed
on end.  The inner circles were composed of smaller stones,
placed in the same  manner, and between the two outermost
upon the east side, there was  a stone chest sunk in the earth.
about 3 feet long, and 1 1/2 wide, which having been accident-
ally uncovered by a country man, he found an urn, which
disclosed nothing but a little dust or ashes.  A little farther
down the hill, towards the S. E. there is another erection
of the same kind.  It consists of 1 circle of pretty large 
stones.
