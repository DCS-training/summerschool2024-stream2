     of Whitsom and Hilton.

   Farms, etc.-They contain the following farms; in enu-
merating and describing which, I begin from the west, and
go eastward.

   1.  The first I shall take notice of is West-laws, the pro-
perty of Robert Hepburn of Clerkington, Esq; consisting of
about 665 acres; the rent of which is only L. 140, upon a
lease; which, from change of times, has proved most dis-
advantageous to the proprietor, without much enriching
the humane, but indolent tenant; as the lease soon expires,
it will no doubt be more than tripled.  West-laws contains
a great deal of fertile, dry, and well-exposed grounds; but
much of it marshy and wet, and many neglected fields,
over-run with whins, etc. but very capable of being im-
proved, when a new lease and an enterprising tenant shall
fall to its share.  The farmer's old, plain, and unadorned
mansion, office houses, and the cottages of his hinds and de-
pendents, form a little village on one of there long emi-
nences with which this part of the country abounds, from
which elevation the farm derives its name; this situation
commands a fine prospect, and may easily be rendered dry
and commodious.

   2.  West Newton, the property of Charles Buchan, Esq;
consists of 250 acres, rented at L. 130, upon a new lease,
(for it has long been occupied by the present tenant and
his father), which commenced at Whitsunday 1794, the
validity of which is now disputed by the proprietor, in a
process before the Court of Session.  Seventy acres of it are
bad, extremely so, being moory and marshy, from the wa-
tery situation of the farm, which renders it often inacces-
sible from most quarters; it is usually called Buchan's
Isle.
