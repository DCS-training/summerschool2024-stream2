     Statistical Account

   Lake and Fish.-Kilbirnie Loch, which lies at the west end of
this parish, is something more than a mile long, and about
half a mile broad, it contains trouts, pikes, perches, etc.
and is frequented in hard winters by many aquatic birds, such
as ducks, geese, swans, etc.

   Fuel, Minerals, etc.-Both peats and coals are used for fuel,
but chiefly the latter.  Peats are always used in drying corn,
and for the purposes of the dairy.  The extent of moss is
very inconsiderable.  Coals are found in many parts of the
parish, but have never been wrought with great success.  We
are plentifully supplied with that useful commodity, from the
neighbouring parishes of Dalry, Lochwinnoch, and Kilbirnie:
and this appears to be the principal reason, why proper efforts
have not been made, to turn our own coal to greater advan-
tage.  We have abundance of whin stone, and tree stone is
found very frequently, but of an inferior quality.  There is,
however, a remarkable species of free stone near the west end
of this parish.  It lies in horizontal laminae, or flakes, to a
considerable depth, and these are from 2 to 6 inches thick, and
from 3 to 4 or 5 feet square.  It does not receive the same
polish as other freestone, but is of a very firm contexture, and
greatly valued on account of its strength.  It is used chiefly
for pavements, and for bridges over small rivulets.  It bears
the weight of the heaviest carriages.  The limestone in this
parish is inexhaustible: besides the great quantities annually
burnt by the farmers upon their own lands, for manure, there
are 2 public lime-works, which have a regular and extensive
sale.  Several beds of stone marle have been lately discover-
ed, and many rich veins of iron stone. See for 651

   Petrifactions.-There are various specimens of figured
stones, and upon some of them, the impressions are exceeding-
