for home consumption.  All the black cattle, the milch-cows
excepted, lie in the fields the whole year round, and are fed
in winter with hay and straw.  Few sheep are raised in this
parish: formerly every farmer had a flock which grazed pro-
miscuously with his black cattle and horses.  As there were
no inclosures, and the ground overstocked, all were in pover-
ty, and in hard seasons numbers perished for want: now,
there is plenty of food both for man and beast.  Many of the
farmers keep a few sheep for their own use, but nothing like
a flock is to be seen except on two or three farms.  Swine
have been tried, but generally given up.

   Rent.-The parish, at a gross computation, is supposed to
contain about 10,000 acres; 1400 of which are under tillage,
the remainder in woods, hay, and pasture.  Land lets from
3 s. to 10 s. per acre, on 19 years leases.  The rents are gene-

tute labour is commuted at the rate of 25 s. for each L. 100 of
valued rent.

   Manufactures, Exports, Mills.-Though there is not a
town, and scarcely any thing that deserves the name of a vil-
lage, yet the parish is not altogether without manufactures:
several thousand ells of plaiding are spun and wove in it.  In
this article the old women, the wives of labourers, and the
women-servants of farmers, are occasionally employed.  The
raw undressed plaiding brings from 7 d. to 12 d. per ell, and
is sold to merchants from Glasgow, at Ayr and Maybole fairs.
For some months past, the woolen manufacture has been
greatly lessened, by the weavers being employed in weaving
muslins rent from Glasgow, the muslin being both a lighter
and more lucrative work.-The chief exports are oats, oat-
meal, black cattle, woolen cloth, and from one district, some
