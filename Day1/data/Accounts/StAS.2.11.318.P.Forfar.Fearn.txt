	In the management of the arable soil, according to the present
usage, the most experienced farmer approves of seven years for a
full rotation, three in grass, followed by two grain crops, (com-
monly oats in succession,) a turnip crop, and then barley, with
which the field is again sown down for grass, with two bushels of
rye-grass seed, six pounds of red clover seed, and two of white.
After a full allowance for seed, meal, and horse-corn, the free
marketable product of the whole parish may be estimated at three
thousand quarters, one-eighth wheat, three eighths barley, and the
remainder oats.
	Within the last twenty-five years, the buildings of the parish
have undergone a complete change, and the means of domestic
comfort have been thereby greatly increased. Nearly one-half of
the farmers were then lodged in low houses, with an earthen or some-
times a stone floor, and these not always provided with a third
apartment; or if the means had been found by others of raising
their hotses to the elevation of a second story, the elevation was
so small, and the construction so defective, as to leave little for
their neighbours to envy, who felt themselves obliged to live con-
tented on terra firma. Their out-houses were of course in the
same mean and rude condition. The change has been so com-
plete, that, almost without an exception, every farmer is now in the
possession of a comfortable dwelling-house and a steading or court
of offices, adequate to every purpose of rural convenience; and in
place of a hovel of stone and feal, no inconsiderable proportion
of the cottars are already in the possession of a slated cottage,
which, within the time referred to, might have been an ob-
ject of desire to tenants responsible for a rent of several hundreds
a year. It is agreeable to add, that this improvement on the cot-
tar's abode has been marked with a corresponding improvement in
his habits of life.
	Beside a large allowance to be made for the more elevated lo-
calities, there is a considerable proportion of waste ground in the
middle district of the parish, and chiefly on what is called the Ba-
rony of Fearn. Whether these and similar wastes, spread out far
and wide over the country, ought to remain in their present un-
cultivated state, the framer of this Account presumes not to hazard
an opinion,-far less to dhsbuss the general but important question,
whether the hardy and industrious population which emigrate from
year to year from their native land in guest of foreign settlements,
might not, under due encouragement, find a resting-place at
