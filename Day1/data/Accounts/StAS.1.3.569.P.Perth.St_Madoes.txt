the country is open all around, and the current of the river
carries off any moisture in the air, that may arise from the
low grounds.  It does not appear by any means to be un-
healthy, nor are there any diseases which can properly be
said to be peculiar to it.  The ague, which used greatly to
prevail here, as well as in other parts of the Carfe of Gowrie,
is now hardly known; a change which is universally attri-

to the draining of the low marshy ground, which formerly
lay under water during a great part of the year.  A curious
observation has been made, by persons who resided some
time in this country, respecting the comparative healthiness
or unhealthiness of different situations in the neighbourhood.
They remarked, that persons residing in the lowest parts of
the Carfe of Gowrie, are in general more healthy, and liable
to fewer diseases than those who live in the higher grounds,
particularly along the face of the hill.  It belongs to medi-
cal gentlemen to account for this; but the fact is asserted
upon pretty attentive and accurate observation.

   Population.-The population seems to have increased con-
siderably within these 40 years; one cause of this may be,

before that time, they lived together in a small village, where
they had not the same conveniences or comforts.  The
farms in general are small, not exceeding 40 or 50 acres,
which is another circumstance favourable to the population
of the country.  The number of souls at present in the pa-
