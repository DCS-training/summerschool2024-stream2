ed with trees.-In the church is an aisle, belonging to the
family of Shelmorly, built by Sir Robert Montgomery, more
than 160 years ago; which, both for sculpture and painting,

where, among others, the body of Sir Robert lies, in a leaden
cossin; on which is the following Latin inscription:

of Alexander the III. the famous battle of Largs, between the
Scots and the Danes or Norwegians*.  The historians on both

into a fruitess controversy on so remote an event, it may be
observed, that there has been, from generation to generation,
an uninterrupted tradition of a battle fought in that place, be-
tween these nations.  The field is still pointed out; cairns of
stones were on it, formed, as was said, over pits, into which
the bodies of the slain were thrown.  An unhewn stone of
granite, ten feet long, once stood on end in that field, erect-
ed over the body of a cheftain.  It is now fallen down. A Danish
ax was found not far from it, and sent by Mr Brisbane of 
Brisbane to the Antiquarian Society at Edinburgh.  The Earl of
Glasgow had another.  If any faith could be given to modern
