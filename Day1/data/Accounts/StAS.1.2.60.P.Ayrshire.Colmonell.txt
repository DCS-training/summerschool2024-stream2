great quantities of hazle nuts, wild strawberries, and wild ap-
ples in them.  These trees grow naturally on banks and steep
grounds, which could be turned to any other purpose equally
profitable.  The price of wood here twenty or thirty years a-
go, was a mere trisle, as there was then very little consump-
tion for it in the country, and no good roads to convey it to o-
ther places; but now it gives better price.  Good oak and
ash, will setch from 1s. 6 d. to 2 s. per cubical foot.  The home
consumption is greatly increased, by the building of better
houses, and by better implements of husbandry, particularly
carts, of which, thirty years ago, there were only two in the
parish, but now there is scarcely a farmer who has not one,
two, three, and some even more in his possession.

   Hills.-Carleton hill rises with a very steep ascent and is si-
tuated so near the sea, on the bay of that name, that a full tide,
there is little more than room for the traveller to pass, without
being in danger from the rocks that threaten to tumble upon
him.  It rises 518 yards above the level of the sea.  Knock-
daw and Knocknormon are equally high, but being farther
removed from the shore, and standing near more elevated
grounds, they do not so much strike the eye of the traveller.
But the most remarkable is Knockdolian, whose height is 650
yards above the level of the sea; and as it rises in a conical
shape, it is both a most beautiful object to the traveller by
land, and of singular service, as a conspicuous land-mark, to
vessels at sea, when they enter the Firth of Clyde.

   Number of Farms, etc.-The lowest rent paid for any farm
in the parish, is L. 7; the highest about L. 200.
