     Observations on the preceding Tables.

   It is evident, that the quantity of stock, the amount of annual produce,
and the value of each, are articles liable to perpetual fluctuation.  But
though minute accuracy cannot be expected, yet it is extremely desirable,
to have some general ideas of such important particulars; and when the cal-
culations are grounded on sufficient data, and relate to an extensive district,
(a county for example), the average result will probably be very near the
truth, the errors of the subdivisions in the district, balancing each other.
   It appears from the table of annual produce, that there are in the parish
of Thurso, about 4,000 acres of arable land, and that the value of live-stock
is 9,144, or about L. 2. 5: 6 per acre.  But as part of that stock is pastu-
red upon commons, the whole produce of the cultivated land will not ex-
ceed L. 8000, 01 about L. 2 per acre.  It also appears, that the total pro-
duce of the land, amounts to about L. 8,626.  The land rent is stated at
L. 4,714: 5: 6; which multiplied by 5, would amount to L. 8,570.  It is
evident therefore, that the produce is equal to more than 5 rents, which
must always be the case, where farms are small, and where the produce per
acre is inconsiderable.
