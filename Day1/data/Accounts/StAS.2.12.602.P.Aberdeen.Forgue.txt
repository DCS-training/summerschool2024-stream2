<TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>
The population in 1755, according to Dr Brewster, was	      .      .          1802
                in 1796, according to the Statistical Account of Mr Dingwall, 1778
The Government return of 1801, gave             .       .       .      .      1871

By a census made by me in 1835, the population was found to be	         .  2440
                          1841,	             .           .              . 2490

   The rapid increase may, in part, be attributed to the reclaiming
of much waste moorish ground and letting it in crofts to the poor-
est class of the people.  There is no town, and, properly speaking,
not a village even in the parish.

   Agriculture.-The number of acres which are cultivated, or oc.
casionally under tillage, may amount, perhaps, to 9000 or 10,000,
and to these many more may still be added, as there remains much
of hill and moor to be reclaimed. Some of the ground rents at
L.2 an acre; some at L. 1 ; some is worth 5s. ; and some so poor
and worthless as not to be worth any rent at all. When let in small
crofts, the beat of the land rents at L.3 per acre. The average rent
of the acre mlay be about 14s.
   The leases are in general for nineteen years.
   Husbandry.-Great improvement has of late taken place in all
the departments of husbandry, but particularly in rearing of stock.
Crosses, especially front the pure Aberdeenshire and the short
horns, turn out well. The course of cropping should be regulated
by the nature of the soil, but generally the five-course shift or the
seven seems to be preferred by the farmer. Mr Walker, a land-
surveyor, and valuator of great ski4l and experience, recommends,
for strong and heavy clay land, a six-course shift, namely, 1. grass;
2. oats; 3. beans or pease; 4. wheat; 5. fallow or green crop;
6.barley, with grass-seeds ; for a heavy loam or alluvial soil the
four-course shift, namely, 1. grass ; 2. oats ; 3. turnips; 4. bar-
ley - and, where the climate is favourable, beans or wheat may be
introduced ; and, for a light foarn. comprehending the old infield,.
he recommends a six-shift course, namely, three years in grass;
one grain crop after breaking tip; then turnips, to be partly eaten
off by sheep ; and, lastly, barley or oats, to be sown down with
grass-seeds. * The writer of this report believes the case practi-
