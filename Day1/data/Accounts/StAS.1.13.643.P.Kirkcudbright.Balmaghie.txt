   Soil, Climate, etc.  -In some places the soil is deep, strong, 
and fertile:  In others, it is light, dry, and kindly; and in 
others again, it is so thin and rocky, as scarcely to admit
of cultivation and improvement.  Here, as in the west of 
Scotland in general, rains are frequent and heavy.  They are
most remarkably so about Lammas, or at lest they are most
pernicious at that season.  The Dee, overflowing its banks,
injures or removes the hay of the meadows, which is sel-
dom cut so early as it ought to be.  These floods are almost
always accompanied with high winds from the west, of
course, the produce of the farms here is more art to be swept
away, than that of lands on the opposite banks of the river.
The air in the moors is rather piercing and cold; but the
district on the whole, cannot be concedered as unfavourable
to health and longevity.  No epidemical deseases are pre-
valent.  Malignant severs somtimes appear in spring, and
are most satal to those who are most poorly fed and lodged.
Several persons have attained to a considerable age.  About
20 years ago, one woman died at the age of 113.  Eighty-
six and 90 are the ages of the oldest persons now alive.

   Population.-The return to Dr Webster in 1755 was 697
souls.  The state of population seems not for some times past
to have undergone any material alternation. The sheep-
farms can never surness employment and subsistence to a
great number of people.  The lands capable of improve-
ment have neither been thrown into farms of immederate
extent, nor broken down into small possessions.  Cot-crofts
(as they were called) have been abolished; but the influence
of this in promoting depopulation, has been sufficiently
counteracted.  The additional labour which improvements
in agriculture occasion, has prevented any from leaving the
place for want of employement, and has encouraged others
