greatly against the interest of the nation, to turn rich arable
land, which is capable at the same time of supporting a
number of people, and of producing much grain, into pas-
ture ground.  But the complaint does not seem to apply to
this country.  The strength of a nation cannot surely con-
sist in the number of idle people which it maintains; that
the inhabitants of this part of the country were Summerly
sunk in indolence, and contributed very little to the wealth,
or to the support of the state, cannot be denied.  The pro-

to be the most beneficial for the country at large.  Still,
however, if the people, who are dispossessed of this land,
emigrated into other nations, the present system might be
justly comdemned, as diminishing the strength of the country.

and partly navigated, by men who were born in this country,
and the greatest number of whom would have remained in
the same state of indolence and insignificance with their an-
cestors, if they had not been obliged to go in search of better
fortunes.  Such of the people as went to towns, and had no
