        great part of the parish was at a remote period covered with forests
        of stately pines, which have all perished without any contemporary
        account existing of the cause or manner of their destruction.  Con-
        sequently, conflicting causes have been assigned for the total ab-
        sence of the native fir in this part of the Highlands; but the ge-
        nerally received belief is, that the old trees died from natural decay
        when at maturity, their trunks being still dug out of the bogs in
        great, numbers; and that from the decomposition of their leaves
        and branches originated the growth of moss, which has now com-
        pletely altered the surface soil, and rendered it unfit for the growth
        of the pine tribe.

                            II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
          Some of the events and localities mentioned in the northern
        Sagas and in the Orcades of Torfaeus are supposed, from an at-
        tentive examination of the narratives, to apply to this parish.
        There exists ample evidence, that after the final departure of the
        northern invaders, the whole of this parish was part of the ancient
        earldom of Sutherland; and consequently, the annals of that po-
        tent family embrace the subsequent historical events in the parish.,
        several of which are described in Sir Robert Gordon's History of
        the Earls of Sutherland.  The charter-room of Dunrobin Castle,
        -which is believed to have the most complete series of title-deeds
        and other invaluable muninients, from the thirteenth century to the
        present time, of any private charter-chest in Scotland,-contains
        written evidences, the most authentic, of the general correctness
        of that remarkable local history, in regard to the state of pos-
        session of the lands in tbe parish at different periods, and similar
        facts.  In the sixteenth century, the chiefs and a great body of the
        clan Gun settled in this parish, which, since then, until a late pe-
        riod, has been their chief place of residence; and, as no connected
        account of them has ever been written, the following original no-
        tice of the clan Gun, prepared with great care from the only au-
        thentic sources relating to them that now exist, is here given in
        as condensed a form as the matter would admit of,-in order to
        suit the prescribed limits of this parish report.
          The Clan Gun.-The clan Gun have at all times been consi-,
        dered throughout the North Highlands as descended from the
        Narwegian Kings of Man; and Lochlin, the Gaelic name for an-
        cient Scandinavia, or, perhaps, in a more limited acceptation, for
        Denmark, is still named by the few natives of the Highlands who
        now recollect the traditions of their fatherd,-as the Parent coun-
        try of the Guns, the Macleods and the Gillantlers. According
