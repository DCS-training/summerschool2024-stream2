in itself, and the mosses adjoining, an inexhaustible fund of the
very best shell marl.  The marl is taken out of the loch by
means of boats and ballast bags, wrought with a wheel; a
mode that is pretty expeditious; and it is taken out of the
mosses, in the way of throwing, usually practised in other parts
of the country.

   Improvements.-Since the loch was drained, the face of the
country, all around, has undergone a very wonderful change in
point of improvement.  Not only Kelton, but the parishes of
Buittle, Crossmichael, Balmaghie, Parton, Balmaclellan and
Kells, reap the benefit of the marl, from the Carlinwark
Loch and its vicinity.  Marl is carried from the Loch in flat
bottomed boats, along the canal to the Dee, in large quanti-
ties, for the improvement of the lands on each side.  It is
conveyed up the river, by means of these flats, as far as New
Galloway, to the distance of 15 or 16 miles*.  Before the
late improvements in husbandry, the crops in this place were,
in general, very light; and the grain, in quantity and quality,
inferior, by far, to what it is now.

   Antiquities.-At the N. E. boundary of the parish, there
is the vestige of an old Druidical temple, near to which there
is an abundant spring of excellent water.  It was, probably held
sacred to the worship of the pagan God, Thor.  From this
temple, the farm in which it is situated, seems to have deriv-
its name, Thors or Tors, plural, being now divided into up-
per, and nether.
   When the water was let out of the Carlingwark loch, in
the year 1755, at the mouth of the drain next to the Loch,
