     Situation, Name, and Extent.

   THE name of this parish was anciently written Aber-
buthenoth, as appears from several old writings extant
in the neighbourhood; but whence it could be derived is un-
certain, as there is no river, or rivulet, whose influx within its
bounds could have occasioned it, if we except one called Fo-
thy or Forthy, which falls into the river Bervy, on the wes-
tern boundary of the parish; but that rivulet has born its
present name above 600 years in the bounding chatters of
some neighbouring estate.  Perhaps the river Berry, of old,
may have born another name, which occasioned the name of
Aberbuthenoth, by its influx into the sea, which is about a
quarter of a mile below the extremity of this parish.
   The parish is nearly of an oblong triangular form, with the
exception of two farms which form a projection southward
of the water of Berry, which is the boundary of the rest of
that side, dividing it from the parishes of Berry and Garvock,
five miles in length.
   Upon the west side it is bounded by the parishes of Fordun
and Glenberry, or the great hollow of the Mearns, the rivers
