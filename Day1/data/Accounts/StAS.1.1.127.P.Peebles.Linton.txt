neral, is the cafe with almost all the pasture land in the pa-
rish.  Except on the North Esk, the cultivated land is either
a mossy soil, or a sandy loam upon a gravelly bottom, and
remarkably adapted for the culture of turnip and potatoe.
There are some lochs in the lands of Slipperfield, belonging
to Mr John Carmichael of Skirling, the largest about a
mile and an half English in circumference.  They have
no outlet; the springs seeming to equipoise the evapora-
tion.  The water is moss water.  They abound in pike and
perch, but contain no eels.  In a loch in Eddlestone parish,
in the country of Tweeddale, called the Water Loch, there is
an outlet with a stream which drives a mill; at certain sea-
sons eels are caught in abundance, in creeks, at the outlet.
The stream falls into one of the Esk waters.  Quere, Do eels
migrate for spawning to running water only, or do they go to
the sea?

   Climate.-Though the climate is rainy, and the air moist
from the number of mosses, yet, being well ventillated, the
exhalations never stagnate or grow putrid, so as to produce di-
seases.  The high lands of Tweeddale and Lanarkshire, are all
subject to harvest frosts, which often damage the crop.  These
frosts are generally dreaded about the latter end of August and
during the month of September.  Rainy weather about this
time generally terminates in this kind of frost, which in the
year 1784, destroyed the whole barley crop in the month of
August.  The highest land is always the last in suffering by
this kind of frost; the lowest is in greatest danger.  In a
calm evening after rain this frost is always apprehended;
when it sets in, a low white thick creeping vapour is obser-
ved to arise, after sun-set, from the running waters and low
lying mosses, which gradually spreads to a certain distance,
and to a certain heighth, on the lands in the neighbourhood.
