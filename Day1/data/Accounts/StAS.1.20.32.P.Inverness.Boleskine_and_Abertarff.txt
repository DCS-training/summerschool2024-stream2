amusement to the reader.  But it would have been unpar-
donable, to neglect giving a short description, of the pro-
ductive shealling or grazing called Killin: It is totally con-
cealed from the few strangers who are pleased to visit the
inhabitants, being surrounded with hills of an immense
altitude, and the access to it so rugged, as frequently to en-
danger the lives of infants, when transported thereto in
manner above described.  It is bounded on the east by a 
lake, from whence issues the principal river composing the
Fall of Foyers; on both sides of this loch the rocks descend
with such inconceivable gradation as hardly to be passable; 
on the north side it is so steep that it is denominated Eakin,
or Necessity, implying the great difficulty of passing that
way; on the south-side called Craggin, or Rocky; and not-
withstanding all the attempts by the inhabitants to render
it passable, it in some parts only contains a path of two or
three feet in breadth; and if a horse stumbles, or is in the
least affrighted, it tumbles down by a precipice into the
deepest part of the lake, and melancholy instances of this
kind have sometimes occurred.  When we come to the end
of this curious path we are struck with amazement; behold
a valley covered with all species of verdure, a computed
mile in length, and half mile in breadth, bisected by a ri-
ver flowing in a meandrous course, composed of a variety
of streams descending from the hills at the wester end; and
on all sides the ground, rising by imperceptible progression
to the clouds, appears green to the very summit.  To this
shealling, the inhabitants, in ancient times, performed their
periodical migrations in manner above described; but since
the introduction of sheep, the same has been mostly detach-
ed from the former possessors, and is now principally inha-
bited by shepherds and their flocks.
   This parish abounds in a variety of lakes, viz. Lochfar-
raline, Lochgarf, the two lakes of Knoky, Lochtarf, Loch-
