belonging to them.  Besides the air furnaces, there are
3 cupola furnaces, that go by virtue of the blast furnaces, by
pipes conveyed from the machinery of the blasts.  Their
business is much the same with the air furnaces.  There are
also 4 boring mills, for boring guns, pipes, cylinders, etc.
One of the boring mills is adapted for turning the guns on
the outside.  They have likewise smiths forges for making
the largest anchors and anvils, as well as small work of vari-
ous kinds; besides a forge for making malleable iron, and a
plating forge:  Also a forge for stamping iron, the hammer
of which, with the helve, are both of cast metal, and weigh
a ton and a half.  A nail manufactory is likewise carried on
in Larbert parish to a considerable extent.

   Church.-There are no places of public worship, except the
established churches of Larbert and Dunipace.

   Produce, etc.-Neither parish can supply itself with
meal, owing to so much ground being laid out in pasture.
In both parishes, there are about 50 acres fown with flax,
and as much with grass.  There is no ground in common
in either, except where the great cattle tryst is held three
times in the year.  It is a dry muir, belonging to Sir Michael
Bruce, where, it is computed, there are between 20,000 and
30,000 cattle collected at the October tryst.  The advantages
enjoyed by both, are plenty of coal, and, from their vicinity to
the great Canal, water carriage to and from the East and 
West seas at an easy rate.  Of course, they have plenty of pro-
visions brought to them from many distant places.

   Antiquities.-Near the Carron works once stood the famous
Arthur's Oven, called by Buchanan Templum Termini.  Seve-
ral Danish forts, or observatories, are in these parishes; one
