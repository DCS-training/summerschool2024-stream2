crop and for pasture, and succeeded very well; but the farm-
ers, in general, have not yet followed this example, chiefly
for want of proper encouragement*.

*Thomas Balsour, before mentioned, after purchasing the estate of Huip,
in the island of Stronsay, began about thirty years ago, to make some improve-
ments in agriculture, particularly on his lands of Linkness above described,
which had previously been used only as sheep pasture.  He erected a steading
of houses there, with a view of turning it into a corn farm, induced no doubt
by the great quantities of ware or sea-weeds for manure thrown upon the
shores of it annually.  The soil was shallow and poor, for much of it had, be-
fore that period, been cut up for fuel or firing for cottars and sub-tenants. As
it had a clay bottom, tolerable crops, when seasons were good, and manure
plenty, were produced; but series of bad seasons having succeeded the year
1776, the heritor, after managing this new farm by servants on his own ac-
count, for ten or twelve years, was pleased to let it to a tenant, together with
a much larger farm, of which it originally was a sheep pasture-pendicle:  But
the farmer having found that Linksness, by being kept in tallage, did not give
returns sufficient to indemnify him for the expence of labouring it, owing to
a series of bad seasons and other unfavourable circumstances, thought proper
to allow it to revert to its former state of natural grass, not much mended
as to quality; in which state it remains to this day.  Mr Balfour, with a
view to improve other parts of his estate in Stronsay, inclosed with earthen
fences, to the extent of about 50 acres Scots measure; and, adjacent thereto,
built a steading of farm houses; But as there acres lay at a much greater dif-
rance from sea weeds than the farm of Linksness and moreover had no title
to such weeds for manure, but by favour of the farmers who had immemori-
ally possessed the privilege of carrying them off to lay on their corn fields, a
different mode of farming from that used in the island of Stronsay behoved to
be adopted, and carried on, under the direction of a farmer or overseer brought
from a part of the country, where equal disadvantages subsisted.  This was
done for a considerable number of years; but this laudable attempt failed of
success.
   Mr Balfour had such influence in this island, that, by his advice and exam-
ple, he induced some farmers on other estates to inclose parcels of their pas-
ture grounds in like manner as he had done; those farmers, however, did not
make any attempts to cultivate or improve the grounds which they had thus
inclosed, prudently and patiently waiting the issue of Mr Belfour's experiments
in this way.
