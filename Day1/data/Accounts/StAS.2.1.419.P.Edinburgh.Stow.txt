   The number of proprietors, as already given, is 16, the yearly
value of the smallest of whose properties here, with property
elsewhere, is considerably above L.100 per annum.  The annual
rents of the smallest proprietor, who has no lands elsewhere, is
above L.300.
   The people may be described as healthy, vigorous, intelligent,
and well-informed, and possessed of the usual characteristics of
an independent and enlightened peasantry, living in a salubrious
district.
   Poaching in game and salmon, the first injurious to the morals,
and the last both to the health and morals of those who engage
in it, are not entirely unknown.

scores, 1045, and single sheep, 21,009.  I have ascertained by
particulars, 208 cattle fattened, and by proportion of rent, (yet
