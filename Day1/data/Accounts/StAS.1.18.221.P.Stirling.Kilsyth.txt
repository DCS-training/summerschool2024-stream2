to promote and encourage it, he generously offered to be at
two thirds of the whole expence; although, in justice, it
could only have been expected that the one half should have
fallen to him.  Yet, at first, only a few of the numerous heri-
tors on the south, accepted even of these advantageous terms;
so that, for the first summer after the contract was made, there
was only a mile and three quarters of the new cut formed.
   The advantages even of this partial improvement were
soon experienced.  The river, in place of oozing through a
muddy crooked course, at the rate of a quarter of a mile in
the hour, runs within the same time, with a steady equable
and full current of two miles; and easily discharges all the
water, without the least danger of overflowing its banks.
   Even though this had been the advantage, it would have
been more than sufficient to compensate the proprietors for
the expence of the work.  But this, though a great is one of
the least of the advantages they now reap.  Formerly the val-
ley on both sides, being nearly on a level with the surface of
the river, even when there was no flood, was of course,
gorged with water; so that the meadows were almost impas-
sable for cattle at any time.  Even part of the arable lands
was often almost in the same state; and was of consequence
unproductive unless in very dry seasons.  At all times, the
crops of hay and corn, before they could be prepared for the
stack or the barn, were dragged from the fields to a dryer
situation, with prodigious labour, and considerable expence;
and what was of as much consequence, with great loss of
time.  Now it is otherwise, the cattle have access to the
meadows at all times.  Even in winter, when they were for-
merly like one continued lake, they are now fit for pasture.
And in summer, the hay may be made where it grows, and
waggons drive along the grounds which were formerly a
morass.  As there is a fall of about 18 feet in the course of
