dificulty in passing the highest net-station long before the fishing
recommenced on Monday morning, after which, they were only
exposed in their farther ascent, to the trifling hazard of being
lured by the skill of an occasional angler.  It may be thought,
however, that such a number will attain the higher parts of the
river when the nets are removed at the end of the season, as will
be sufficient to preserve the breed, and even secure an abundant
fishing for the ensuing year.  But this cannot be the case, for the
fish are in general so dull and heavy at the end of the season,
that, having little inclination or ability to go far up the river, they
pot themselves, as it is here called, in the first eligible pool, and
shed their spawn on the low fords and shallows, where it is exposed
to all the dangers which have already been enumerated.
   The truth of these remarks may be proved by the following
statement of the number of salmon exported from Aberdeen du-
ring the last six years; for, if it be remembered that the salmon
trade of that city is not only supplied from the river, but chiefly
from an extensive range of coast, that statement will demonstrate
that the present mode of employing the stake and bag-nets in this
fishery is tending rapidly to render the salmon-breed extinct.
