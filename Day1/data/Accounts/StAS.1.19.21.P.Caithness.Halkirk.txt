   Quadrupeds.  Birds indigenous and migratory.  Game.-
The quadrupeds in this parish, both domestic and wild,
harmless and ravenous, are much the same as in other High-
land parishes, and not less numerous.  For the game, there
are some deer and roe, also otters, foxes, and hares, in
great abundance.  About 60 years ago, no hares were to
be seen in this parish or country; now they are not plentier
any where than here.
   The birds that are native or indigenous are the same
also as in other northern Highland parishes, and not less
numerous.  The migratory birds are the same also; such
as the feltifer, the green plover or lapwing, the quail or
corn-crake, the woodcock, the cuckoo, the snow-fowl.  For-
merly the lapwing visited this parish in multitudes; now
we do not see the hundredth part of what was wont to be
seen of them; and very soon, as the number yearly de-
creases, we will see none at all.  The spring feasts in Eng-
land will soon destroy that delicious bird we were wont to
rear and feed for their table, and deprive us of their visits.
The birds for game are of various kinds, and some kinds
very numerous, the moorfowl, the blackcock, the tarma-
chan, plovers of severa1 kinds, snipes, pigeons, partridges.
It is only of late years that this last bird was to be seen
here.  We have also swans, wild-geese of different kinds it,
vast numbers, ducks in great variety and numbers also, be-
sides several other birds too tedious to mention.  On the
whole I know not any place that can afford better game
than this parish.
