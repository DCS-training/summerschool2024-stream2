     Statistical Account

   Population.-The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, was 1736
souls.  In June 1791, there were of inhabitants, above seven
years of age, 1150; below seven, 190.-In all, 1340.  In the
year 1761, there were in all 1580; decrease, 240, which is
accounted for by the emigration of work people to the ma-
nufactories about Aberdeen; by some of the heritors taking
large farms into their own management; by a few of the te-
nants not choosing to have any subtenants; and by a very
uncommon mortality which prevailed in winter 1789 and
1790.  For several years immediately subsequent to 1761,
the number of people increased greatly, and it is only with-
in the last 14 or 16 years, that the decrease has taken place.
There are at present 200 inhabited houses, fewer by 60 than
in 1761.

   Agriculture and Stock.-In the year 1758, there were but
two carts in the parish, now 120.  Horses about 260; sheep,
3250; black cattle, 1300; but have not been exactly num-
bered.  The sheep are of a small size; and have much de-
creased in number in the course of the last 50 years, partly
owing to the inability of firmers to stock their possessions
properly, and partly because the stocking manufactory, the
only manufactory carried on here, has been supplied with
English wool, by the hosiers of Aberdeen; which manufac-
tory is of considerable extent, and has been the only means
of raising the land rent, at least one-third of its present value.
   The state of agriculture is, in general, much the same as it
has been in the memory of man.  More grain of the com-
mon kinds, oats and bear, is raised than is consumed in the
parish; but the export not great, nor well ascertained.  It is
believed, that there is much less now raised than was 50 or
60 years ago, as the stocking of farms is much diminished,
and particularly, the number of oxen employed in tillage, is
