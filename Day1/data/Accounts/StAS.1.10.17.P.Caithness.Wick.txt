   Occupations.-There are few handicraftsmen in the coun-
try part of the parish, which is principally inhabited by far-
mers.  The leases of there farmers are commonly of short du-
ration, and they are bound to perform heavy and almost un-
limited services to the landlord.  There services are, in gene-
ral, as follows; viz. in spring, ploughing, harrowing, and
manuring; in summer, weeding corns, cutting, winnowing,
leading, and stacking hay; thatching office-houses with the
tenants own turf, straw, and simmons; cutting and leading
midding feals, etc.; in harvest the farmer must, if a fair day
offer, assist when called out in cutting down his landlord's
(or as here termed his master's) crop, though he leave his
own entirely neglected, and exposed to bad weather; he
must afterwards lead and stack it in the corn yard, and, at
some interval, must rebuild the stacks, furnishing them with
straw and simmons of his own; in winter, some tenants
thresh part of the master's crop, giving him what is called
custom straw, besides wintering his cattle, and furnishing
ropes for the ploughs and for binding the cattle.  Tenants have,
moreover, to take their master's victual, kiln-dry, mill, and
sift it, and deliver in meal at a proof; and when it is sold to
a merchant, they are obliged to carry it, as well as their own
victual rent, to the neighbouring port and put it on ship
board, their horses often standing all the time, for many hours,
starving with cold and hunger.  The tenants must also in ro-
tation be obedient at a call to carry letters from their master
to any part of the county.  These oppressive and impolitic
services are here very properly called master-work, but they
are rapidly wearing out; and it is to be hoped will soon be
entirely abolished: Already, indeed, some gentlemen have
converted the services of their tenants, and given them leases
