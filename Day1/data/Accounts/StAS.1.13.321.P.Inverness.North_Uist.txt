   Miscellaneous Obsevations.-Nature has furnished this
parish, when the tide is out, with the best road that can be 
in any country, being for the most part over plains and ex-
tensive sands; but when these sands are overflowed with 
the sea, the traveller must go by a more tedious path, 
where there are very bad steps, especially in winter wea-
ther.  However, these steps will soon become very good 
road, as the people were made to work at them for some 
days in the spring season for two years past, and must 
continue to do so till they are finished.  It may be a mat- 
ter of surprise, that though no trees grow at present in this 
parish, the time has been when the whole face of it was 
covered with wood.  The truth of this assertion is evident
from this circumstance, that the roots of trees are found in 
peat mosses, in different parts, and even below high water 
mark; where the sand is washed away by the sea, or blown 
away by the wind, they plainly appear in a kind of black 
soil, or rather moss.  This is the case, particularly in the 
island of Vallay.  The only method of accounting for this 
is, that the spray of the Atlantic Ocean, which is carried 
by the westerly winds in the atmosphere over the whole 
island, is unfavourable to the growth of trees.  This is 
clearly proved from experiments frequently made of plant- 
ing trees in gardens, where they spring up fast to the height 
of the garden-wall, but never higher; and though it is 
evident that the island was once covered with trees, it 
must have been at a period when the ocean was at a greater

dition gives out to be the oldest building of the kind in the Highlands. 
What corroborates this tradition is, that from the circumstance of its 
being dedicated to the Trinity, it seems to have been built before the 
Romish kalendar was made known in these parts; all churches built since 
that period being dedicated to saints.
