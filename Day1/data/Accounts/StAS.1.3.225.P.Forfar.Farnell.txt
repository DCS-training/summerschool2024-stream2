   Soil.-The soil is fertile, and generally low land, being si-

streams, sometimes in autumn swells to an amazing size, over-

Efk, which rises among the Grampain mountains, runs close
by the south side of the town of Brechin, and after mean-
dering beautifully through the strath, discharges itself into the
bason, formed by the reflux of the sea, on the west side of
Montrose.  A considerable part of this river forms the boun-
dary of the parish of Fernell, on the north.  It abounds in
salmon and salmon-trout; and the fishing upon the part of
it, which now belongs to the parish of Fernell, the property
