               PARISH OF ETTRICK.

PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TEVIOTDALE

        THE REV.  JAMES SMITH, MINISTER.

      I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HlSTORY.
   Name, &c.-In a charter of Alexander II. to the monks of
Kelso, the Ettrick of Setkirkslhire is repeatedly mentioned by the
various names of " Ettric iiid Ethvric." The name is of doubtful
origin. " Eitrigh in Gaelic sigdifies a furrow or trench.  Eithrach
in the same language means a wilderness." Again, the Ed of the
language of the British Aborigenes signifids a current, and Terig,
mud; both names being characteristic of this river wheat its waters
are raised  * and igitated by the mountaini-torrents.
   In the last Statistical Account, the parish has been described as
being at averge ten miles long by tell broad; but in a late sur-
vey published bv Oliver and Boyd (1829) its area in square miles
has been stated at 68.69 miles or 43,968 imperial acres.                             It is
bounded on the north by the parish of Yarrow, and touched by
Meggat in Peebles-shire; south and west by the Parishes of Moffat
and Eskdalemiur in Duinfries-shire; and on the east, by a part of
Yarrow and Roberton.  Its surface is hilly and mouintainous.  The
hills are beautifully rounded, and are almostall covered with rich green
grass from top to bottom: Two or three indeed are spotted with
health, which only adds by its variety to the beauty of tile scenery.

<FOOTNOTE>Mr James Hogg, in his Statistics of Selkirkshire, published in the 18th number of
the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture, says, " In old deeds and charters it is first found
written Alterick, then Atterick and finally Etterick.   Atterick is really as good
Gaelic as a borderer could spell.  Alterick signifies the rising strearm or stream of the
rapid ascent."
