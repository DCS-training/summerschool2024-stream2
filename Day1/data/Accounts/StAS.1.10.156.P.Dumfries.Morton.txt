   Manufactures.-It has often been the subject of wonder, as
well as of regret, that Thornhill, or its neighbourhood, has
never been chosen by any person as a situation for establish-
ing a manufacture.  It certainly is extremely well adapted to
that purpose, infinitely more so than many places where ma-
nufactures flourish in great perfection.  The price of provi-
sions is always considerably lower than in Lanark or Renfrew
shires.  The price of fuel is moderate; for, though coals are
brought from Sanquhar, 12 miles distant, they are sold here
at 4 d. or 4 1/2 d. per cwt.; and there is abundance of water in
the Nith and Carron for driving machinery.  Though the
prevailing rage seems now to be directed to the cotton manu-
facture, wool, which is the staple of this country, seems a
more natural object.

   Inns, Roads, etc.-In Thornhill are two inns, and a consi-
derable number of dram-houses, which are by no means fa-
vourable to the health or morals of the people.  Two high
roads cross each other in this village; the one leading from
Dumfries to Ayrshire and Glasgow by Sanquhar, and to
Edinburgh by Leadhills; the other going westward into Gal-
loway by Minnyhive.  The former was made a turnpike
last years, and is well directed and finished.  Upon it are two
bridges, one over Cample, and the other over Carron.  On
the road towards Galloway, there is a good bridge across the
Nith.  The bye-roads through the parish are but indifferent;
but now that the principal road is supported by tolls, it is
hoped they will be put into better order, the whole money
arising from the conversion of the statute labour being ap-
plied to them.
