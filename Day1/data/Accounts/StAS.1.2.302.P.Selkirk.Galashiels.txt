   April.  When the seed time of oats is over, potatoes are
planted, and the land, designed for barley, receivers a second
furrow.-From the 28th of April, to the 12th, or even the
15th of May, pease are fown; and from that time, barley,
till the beginning of June.  This late sowing, supplies, in
some measure, the defect of soil; generally secures a sufficient
growth of straw, and never endangers the loss of a crop, from
the lateness of reaping.  In every season, the latest sown grain,
on dry gravely sand, ripens before the earliest sown on clay
land; and grain of every kind, sown on dry soil, earlier than
the above periods, seldom turns well out, except when the
ground is very full of manure.-Though harvest has been
known to commence early in August, and to be mostly over
in September, yet it more commonly begins with September,
and ends about the middle of October.
   This dry land may consist of 500 acres, of which 300 are
annually in oats, and the remaining 200 in barley, pease,clo-
ver, potatoes, and turnips, nearly in equal proportions.  But
as the three last are produced in great perfection, it may be
expected, that the increase of these green crops, will diminish
the quantity of oats, still annually fown, and help to check
the ruinous system of impoverishing land, by a succession of
white crops.  A few acres here, as well as in the southern
district, are sometimes dedicated to wheat.  The rest of the
land in tillage, on the north of Tweed, which is either in-
clining towards clay, or lying in a high exposed situation, con-
sisting mostly of irregular spots on the sides of hills, cannot be
so accurately ascertained, but may be safely computed at
200 acres; on which hardly any other grain is sown, except
oats, the small quantities of barley and pease being scarcely
worthy of notice.
