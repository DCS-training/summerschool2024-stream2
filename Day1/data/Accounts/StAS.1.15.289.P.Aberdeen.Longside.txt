   Poor.-The fund for the support of the poor arises from
the weekly collections, and the interest of a small sum, be-
gun by charitable donations, and encreased by an aeconomi-
cal management, particularly during years when the neces-
saries of life were easily acquired; about 20 L. Sterling is
distributed annually among about 30 families, but is, by no
means, found sufficient to assist industry in procuring a com-
fortable subsistence:-With no other view ought money to be
given; and with this, a very small sum will do more service
than ten times its value, when it is depended on as a substi-
tute for industry.  Of the 20 L. above mentioned, 5 L. Ster-
ling is given annually by one of the heritors*; and the dis-
tribution of it is confined to the poor on his own estates:
-A practice which deserves to be imitated; particularly in
a parish where, in the present case, there is not a single re-
sident heritor to attend to the wants of the poor in extraor-
dinary cases. N. B.  The members of the episcopal congre-
gation support their own poor.

   Manse, Stipend, School, etc.-The parish of Longside was
erected in the year 1620, from the parishes of Peterhead
and Crimond; with which last mentioned parish there
seems to have been formerly a communication in the N. E.
corner, where now the parishes of St Fergus and Lonmay
meet each other.  The original stipend was 120 l. Scots,
and 400 merks of vicarage trinds, which are still drawn-by
the minister, but do not produce above 260 merks.  In 1668,
it was augmented with 4 chalders of grain; and, in 1791,
with 3 chalders more, and 60 Scots for communion elements.
At the time of the last mentioned augmentation, an appli-
cation was made to have the vicarage tends converted, on ac-
count of the deficiency above mentioned, and the disagreeable
