which Stranraer labours under.  The chief fuel is peat and turf,
brought from the distance of 3 or 4 miles; often of a bad
quality, and always high priced.  Many of the inhabitants
burn coals in their rooms.  These are brought from Air or
Irvine by sea, and cost the purchaser about fourteen pence
the herring-barrel, including the price of leading from the
shore.  A family, keeping only a regular fire in the kitchen,
and another in a parlour, must expend six or seven guineas a
year for firing alone.  Would parliament take off the duty
upon coals carried coastwise, the improvement of this town,
and the neighbouring country, would advance with incon-
ceivable rapidity The late Earl of Stair made several unsuc-
cessful attempts to find coal in the neighbourhood.

   Church and Stipend.- A new, commodious, and even ele-

Vans Agnew, and pay L. 3: 11: 1 1/3, as feu and teind.  The
house was rebuilt in 1761.  To Mr Laurie's munificence the
minister of Stranraer is indebted for the tolerably decent man-
ner in which he lives.  The minister has a right also to the
vicarage teind of the herrings taken in Lochryan, by the in-
habitants of the town and Clayhole, at the rate of the twen-
tieth herring:  But this depending on a subject so preca-
rious in itself, and so difficult to be levied, can never be pro-
ductive.  The present minister may truly say he has not, on
an average, received 10s. a year from this source.  He was
