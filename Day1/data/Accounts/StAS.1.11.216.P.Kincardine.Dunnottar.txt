giving occasion to rheumatism and consumption; but not re-
markable for any other disease.  Agues are here quite un-
known, though prevalent through all the parishes to the
southward.-No rivers run through this parish, but several
small rivulets, which chiefly find their way into the Carron
upon the N.; the rest of the water running toward the
southern boundary, and forming there a small stream.  In
the Carron there are excellent trouts, and at its mouth a sal-

   Sea Coast and Fowls.-The sea coast is very bold, formed
of the plumb-pudding rock, and containing several deep caves.
The most remarkable part of the coast is called Fowls-heugh,
about a mile in extent, and 30 fathoms high, inhabited by

to catch the fowls.  The feathers and down of these fowls are
in great demand; and the kittyweaks, whose flesh resembles
that of solan geese, are sold at high prices in the neighbour-

for the liberty of catching the fowls: And 6 men are com-
monly employed in the work; 5 of these being required to
let down and draw up the person in the rope.  These sea fowls
are all migratory, appearing in April, and removing south-

   Fish and Kelp.-The fishing, upon this part of the coast,
has much declined for some years past, the sea not producing
near its usual quantity: But what are caught, are of excellent
quality.  Three boats and a yawl, with 6 men in each, are
