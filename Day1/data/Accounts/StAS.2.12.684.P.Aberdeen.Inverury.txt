   Even now, the original subscribers to this undertaking derive
no interest for their money, but the land rents have been raised
from the facilities of transit which the canal affords.  There are
on the canal about thirty barges, besides an iron boat for passen-
gers and light goods, which runs to Aberdeen daily. *
   About sixty hand-looms for weaving linen have been for some
time employed; the introduction of a manufacturing population
has not been favourable to morals.  The number of low public-
houses and of houses for barbouring vagrants, is also a just sub-
ject of complaint.
   Of the 5000 acres which the parish contains, 3000 are under til-
lage, 1000 are in thriving plantations, and 1000 uncultivated.
The rotation of cropping most generally followed is what is called the
seven shift, i. e. two green crops aftergrass; 3d, turnips or potatoes;
4th, grain crop, (bear, barley, or oats), with grass seeds ; 5th, 6th,
nd 7th, grass.  Perhaps 500 of the 11000 acres uncultivated
might be reclaimed by a proper application of capital.  The ave-
rage rent of arable land (including the burgh lands) may be L.1,
5s. per acre.  No flocks of sheep are kept by farmers here; many
have a few ewes and lambs of the English breeds for domestic use,
and chiefly for the sake of the wool.  The Aberdeenshire breed
of cattle is most general but with a few of the more extensive and
opulent farmers, the short-horns are coming into favour.
   The leases are mostly for nineteen years; the farm-houses and
steadings have, within, a short time, greatly improved, and the con-
dition of the tenantry is, I believe, on the whole prosperous: this
I know, that when the Earl of Kintore's farms were nearly out of
lease, he sent for an experienced land-surveyor of character, and
the only instructions he gave him for valuing were, "now remember
the maxim, 'Live and let live.'"

   Burgh.-The government of the burgh continues by the Muni-
cipal Bill of 1833, vested in a provost, three bailles, dean of guild,
treasurer, and three councillors who seem to prosecute with zeal
whatever they conceive for the interests of the burgh.  The number
of electors in the parliamentary burgh, (which includes Port-El-
