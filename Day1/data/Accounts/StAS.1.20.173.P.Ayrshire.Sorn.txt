of some powerful friends. But though thus saved from
transportation to a foreign land, Mr Peden was by no means
permitted to live in peace at home.  He was still an object
of vengeance, and hunted about from place to place.  He
found a retreat sometimes in Ireland and sometimes in
Scotland, till at length, in January 1686, death put a pe-

age.
   But the spirit of persecution, whether Catholic or Prote-

those who are suffering severely in a good cause, previous
intimations of future events, in which their own fate or
that of their oppressors is deeply concerned, it would, I
think, be rash and unwarrantable positively to deny.  In
