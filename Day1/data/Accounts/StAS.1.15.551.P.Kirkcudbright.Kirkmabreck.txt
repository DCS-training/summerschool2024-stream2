centre, between two different places, at about a hundred
yards distance from it, where a great number of human bo-
dies have been buried, as appears from the number of
stones placed upon one end in form of grave stones.  We
are told by several of the Scottish writers, that Corbredus
Galdus, the twenty first king of the Scots, (a valiant and
good king,) was the first of that nation who dared to ad-

Cerealis, had subdued the Brigantes*, and soon after
proceeded to attempt the conquest of this country, under
Julius Agricola, who, having landed upon this coast, de-

Isle of Man; after which, he returned, and after many a
bloody battle with the Scots and Picts, about the year A. D.
82, he subdued the whole of the kingdom South of the Tay.
History also informs us, that one of these battles was fought
at the river Cree, (which still retains its ancient name,)
wherein the Scots were overthrown, but no mention made of
the slaughter of their king; on the contrary, we are told by
Buchanan, that this same King Galdus died a natural death,
after a glorious reign of thirty five years.  We are also in-
formed of another battle fought on the river Cree, about the
year A D. 310, wherein the Picts joined the Romans un-

king Eugenius, but wherein the Scots were again over-
thrown.  But in vain do we develope the history of these
times; owing to the ambitious policy of Edward the 1st of
England, a veil is thrown over them which can never be re-
moved.  There is also a different ccount concerning this
place, which seems to be founded on history, and which
