   MERCATOR CALEDONIUS being much dissatisfied with this attack
upon his lucubrations, published a very angry reply; in consequence of
which the Author wrote the following letter, which ended the contro-
versy.

     No II.
     To the Publisher of the Caledonian Mercury.

   SIR,

   Though I have considered, Mr Printer, with the utmost attention, the
situation of some of our western Highlanders; though I have asked
again and again the sentiments of my friends on this interesting subject, yet
I still continue in the same opinion I at first adopted: and so far am I from
thinking, that the departure of a few factious and idle Highlanders would
prove documental to these united kingdoms, that I would with a contribu-
tion was immediately begun; let them be shipped off at the public expence,
whilst the whim continues, and let them be transported to a country, where
they may find a nation perhaps as savage as themselves, and, if possible,
equally destitute of the least appearance of religion and virtue.  But I hope
that the sober and the diligent will not think of following then example;
let them be deterred from executing that scheme, by the     miscarriage
of the first attempt; the news lately arrived in Scotland, that some of these
people, who had left the fruitful Argyleshire coasts, to inhabit the Ameri-
can wilds, had not met with that reception they wished or expected.  You
might have heard Mr Printer, that some of them died, during a long and
tedious voyage, that some suffered the worst of deaths, by the want of sub-
sistence; and that the rest were so overcome by the change of the air, and
the inclemency of the weather, that few, if any, expected to see the return
of another summer.  I hope that this news will be of some advantage to
my deluded countrymen; let them consider the danger of perishing in a
vast and tempestuous ocean, without a friend or a neighbour to assist them
in their distress, how they must go to a country where their language is
unknown, and then misery will be disregarded; how they must leave
a beloved wife and tender infants, to bewail their absence with unavailing
tears, when left to the care of a treacherous friend, or a concealed enemy:
and even supposing that they do safely arrive at these barren deicits; sup-
posing that they can speak the dialect of the country, and that at first they
are viewed with the tender eye of pity and compassion, yet how can they
expect to be long supported by hardened avarice, or flagging charity?  How
can they then expect to receive assistance and alms from the savages of the
desert, or obtain a settlement, even in that vast and boundless country, with-
out the necessary aids of friends and money? and when reduced to the last
extremity in a foreign country, they will then, perhaps, be worse than the
