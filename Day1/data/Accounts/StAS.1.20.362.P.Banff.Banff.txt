     Statistical Account

   By the care and exertions of the late minister, a charity
school was founded some years ago, for the poor children
of the town and parish.  The numbers usually attending this
school are from 25 to 30 children.  They are taught to
read, and instructed in the principles of religious know-
ledge.  For securing an annual and permanent salary of
L. 20 to a well qualified teacher, the sum of L. 4000 was
sunk in the hands of Magistrates.  This fund was raised
by the voluntary contributions of the landholders, the inha-
bitants, and occasional visitants, and by appropriating, with
consent of the heritors, L. 200 of the poor's money.
   The girls attending the school are furnished with easy
and profitable work, by spinning wool for Messrs Robin-
sons stocking manufacture*.
   The provost, minister, and rector of the academy, are the
patrons of this school.
   Besides these, there are two English schools, in different
parts of the town.  The teachers, having no stated salaries,
depend entirely on the fees paid by the scholars.

   Boarding Schools for young Ladies.-Here, too, are repu-
table boarding-schools, for the education of young ladies.
One of these is conducted by Misses Mitchels from Eng-

<FOOTNOTE>

The principles on which this academy is conducted, are contained in Dr
Chapman's Treatise on Education, a fifth edition of which is Lately publish-
ed, and much approved of by the Reviewers.

To this edition the author has given a short supplement, containing use-
ful Observations on two Essays on Education lately published.  He has
subjoined further Thoughts on the Instruction necessary for the lower ranks
of the People; on the appointment of Parochial Schoolmasters, and on the
Encouragement they ought to receive.

*Besides a small fund belonging to this school, there is a public annual
collection made, for defraying the expences of some necessary clothing to
the poorer children.
