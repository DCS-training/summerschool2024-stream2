     of Harris.

The E. coast is indented all along with harbours, bays, and,
creeks, and exhibits to a spectator at sea the molt barren as-
pect, appearing to be a continued bare rock.  Near the shore,
however, a few green patches are to be seen, brought into
culture by the laborious industry of the inhabitants, in the
manner hereafter to be described.  The country is inhabited
along the shore on each coast.  The intermediate space is a
wild uncultivated common.  Within this district on the W.
coast are two large tracts of sand, covered by the sea at high
water only.  One of them is circular, and upwards of 4 miles
in circumference; the other is oblong, about 1 1/2 mile long,
and a mile broad.  The inlet to each from the sea is narrow
but deep.  The process of recovering them would be hazard-
ous and expensive; but were they brought into culture, they
would be more valuable than all the arable lands in this dis-
trict of Harris besides.  The names of the principal farms in
this division appear to be Norwegian, e. g. Scarasta, Borough or
Borve, Nifabost, Horgabost, Shelabost.

     3. Description of the Forest of Harris, and the Northern Isles.

   The range of mountainous pasture N. of Tarbert, towards
the Country of Lewis, is called the Forest, though without
a tree or even a shrub, because it is the resort of the deer,
and is alledged to have been a royal forest.  It begins at the
narrow isthmus, called Tarbert, which connects this division
of the mainland of Harris with that already described.  This
Isthmus, about 1/4 mile broad, separates the two largest har-
bours in Harris, which approach it in opposite directions, and
are called East and West Loch-Tarbert.  Its extent from S. to
N. scarcely equals its breadth; and the mountains on each
side being high, steep, and barren, it appears a deep, dark,
horrid gulph.  The Forest, bounded E. and W. by the open
