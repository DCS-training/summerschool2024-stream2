	Taking old and new Auchenairn as one village, we have eight
villages in the parish, viz. Cadder, Bishops-bridge, and Auchen-
airn in the west division of the parish; Auchenloch, Chryston,
Muirhead, Mudiesburn, and Mollenburn in the eastern district.
Of these, Chryston is the largest, and by far the most handsome,
and might become a large and neat village, if it had water; but it
depends almost entirely on the well of Bedlay, which is at least
the eighth part of a mile distant, and has a very steep descent to it.
Chryston contains 84 families and 374 persons; Auchenairn, old and
new, 60 families and 284 persons; Bishops-bridge, 38 families and
175 persons; Mollenburn, 32 families and l72 persons. This village
is well situated for wood and water and whinstone rock, and might be-
come a handsome village, were the feu more moderate. Mudiesburn,
30 families and 143 persons; Cadder, which used to contain at least
50 families, contains now only 13 families, and 64 persons, all em-
ployed on the estate of Cadder; Auchenloch, 17 families, 89 per-
sons; Mulrhead, 9 families, and 40 persons. The lime, coal, and
clay-works at Garnkirk, have collected a very considerable popu-
lation, of such a description as is found about newly erected pub-
lic works.
	The average number of births registered for the last seven
years, is about fifty; proclamations, twenty-five; deaths or burials,
about thirty. The births have never been all registered, though
those who are not able to pay, get them recorded gratis. Some
have always buried in other parishes. In 1828, a burying-ground
was purchased at Chryston, where the greater part in that division
of the parish now bury. The ground is sold, in perpetuity in
three lairs, the highest cost of which is L. 3 in the very best
isituations. It has been drained, but being an impervious till,
the draining has had little effect. The private burying-places,
said to be six in number, by the writer of the last Account,
viz. Chryston, Bedlay, Gartferry, Auchingeish, Easter Muck-
croft, and the tombs at Auctienairn, are fast failing into decay.
Over Chryston tomb, where many of the Grays of Chryston and
others repose, the Cumbernauld road has now been carried.
	There are three fatuous persons in the parish, one of them deaf
