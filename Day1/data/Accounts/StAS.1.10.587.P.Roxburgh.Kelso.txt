The disproportion between the average number of each fa-
mily of the town and country, is owing to the number of
widows and single women, who live more conveniently in
the town, and get employment more readily than in the
country.  In 38 years, the increase of inhabitants has been
1543.  This great increase may, in part, be accounted for,
from the destruction of many villages in the neighbourhood,
occupied by small farmers and mechanics.  From the en-
largement of the farms, many were obliged to follow other
trades, and Kelso being the metropolis of the district, they
flocked there for habitations and employment; and, in pro-
portion as labourers and mechanics have become fewer in
the country, Kelso increased in population.

   Fairs, Markets, Manufacturers, etc.-The weekly market
day is Friday.  There are twelve high markets in the year,
two before and one after the term days of Whitsunday and
Martinmas; the two first are for hiring male and female ser-
vants; the last is generally employed by the servants in
mirth, and in laying out their wage, before they enter again
