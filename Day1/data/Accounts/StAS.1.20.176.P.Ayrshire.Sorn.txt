   Manufactures.-Catrine is entirely a new creation, and
owes its existence to the flourishign state of the cotton ma-
nufacture in Great Britain.  In the year 1787, Mr Alex-
ander of Ballochmyle, the proprietor of the village, in part-
nership with the patriotic Mr Dale of Glasgow, built a cot-
ton twist-mill in the centre of the above square, with a fall
of water, from the dam-head to where it returns again to
the river, of 46 feet.  A jeanie factory and a corn-mill are
drove by the same fall.  It is likewise proposed to erect a
waulk or fulling mill on this stream of water.  The twist-
mill consists of 5 square stories, besides garrets; and contains
5240 spindles, which are all going at present (December
1796).  Three hundred and one persons, old and young,
are just now employed, in carding, roving, and in spinning,

mill-wrights, and other mechanics, amount to 15 more.
The women, who pick cotton in their own houses, are at
present 226.  In all, belonging to the twist-mill, by last-re

are between 12 and 20; and 200 are above 20 years of age.
The total amount of wages paid from October 30, 1795,
to October 28, 1796, is L. 3193 Sterling; and, as far as can
be ascertaind, the average quantity of cotton spun weekly
is 2660 libs.  In the year 1790, the same company built a
jeanie factory, which contains 76 jeanies.  The carding,
roving, etc. are performed by the tail-water of the twist-
mill.  Here 200 persons, including an overseer, two clerks,
