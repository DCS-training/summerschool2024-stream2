     of Irvine.

parish of Dreghorn on the south-east and east; by the parish
of Kilwinning on the north and north-east; by the river
Garnock on the north-west, and by the river of Irvine,
which separates it from the parish of Dundonald, on the
south.  To the north-west of the town, there is a common-
ly belonging to it, of above 300 acres, of a sandy soil, and
partly covered with whin and short broom.  If laid off in
proper inclosures, and rented to the inhabitants, it might be
worth 20 s. or 30 s. per acre in a few years.  Adjoining to
this, and immediately at the back of the town, there was
formerly a large loch, which, about the beginning of this
century, was drained by the Rev. Mr Warner, and is now
arable.  To the north-east, the town have a considerable
tract of land, yielding a revenue of about 500 l. per annum.
The lower part of the parish is flat and sandy.  To the north-
east of the town, it consists of a light loam; in some parts
the soil is mixed with gravel; all of it produces heavy crops
of all different kinds of corn and grass.  Towards the ex-
tremity of the parish, the situation is more elevated and the
soil of a stiffish clay.
   There is only one gentleman's seat in the parish, Bour-
treehill.  It is well laid out, and highly improved, by the
Hon. Mr Hamilton, who resides upon it.  Nigh to this seat,
there is an old castle of a square form, belonging to the Earl
of Eglintoune, whose seat is also about a mile from Irvine to
the north, and the town lands on that quarter are all along
bounded by his Lordship's policy.  This castle is said to be
the remains of an ancient nunnery, where there was a chapel,
church-yard, and a small village.  The face of the country
is greatly beautified by circular plantations on most of the
eminences.  The farms are large, the farm houses are mostly
new, very neat and convenient.
