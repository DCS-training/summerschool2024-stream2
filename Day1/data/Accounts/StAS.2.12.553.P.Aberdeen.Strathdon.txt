obstacles to agricultural improvement.  In not a few instances
these evils are aggravated by deficiency of agricultural capital.
it unfortunately happens, such is the desire to possess a farm,
arising perhaps from local attachment, that whenever a place be-
comes vacant, an unwise competition takes place, which leads to
the offer of higher rents than prudence can at all times justify.
   Quarries.-There are eight or ten quarries of limestone, which
are regularly worked for the supply of the parish, and to meet a
considerable demand from Kildrummy and Towie.  The quality
of the lime is excellent, being part of the same great bed of lime-
stone wrought near Keith and at Ardonald.  It is a singular fact,
that all the limestone rocks lie on the north side of the Don, with
the exception of one near Boilhandy.  The lime is burned with
peats, with the addition of a small quantity of coals when they
can be obtained.  A slate quarry was formerly wrought, but the
quality being coarse, it has been long abandoned.
   Produce.-The statement of raw produce is given as taken in
the year 1835-36, no year since having been nearly an average
crop.  The gross amount, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as
follows :-

   Manufactures.-There is not anything deserving the name of a
manufactory in the parish.  At the wool-mill of Glenkindy, the
average quantity of blankets and plaiden manufactured per annum
is about 2220 yards ; listing 4000 yards ; woollen yarn spun 5800
cuts.  The number of persons employed is 6.

   Market-Town.-The nearest market-town is Aberdeen, forty-
five miles distant; but at Rhynie, eighteen miles distant, there is
weekly an excellent market for butcher-meat.  It is to Aberdeen
that all the grain and other produce is driven, and from thence
that all the merchandize, groceries, and coals are brought.  There
is no village in the parish, unless nine cottages at Heugh-head
may be called one.
