	In the Established church the Lord's supper is dispensed twice
a year. The average number of communicants each time may be
stated at about 850 in the parish church, and 680 in the Abbey
chapel of ease. Amongst the operative classes, it is very common
for the husband to communicate at the one time, and the wife at
the other; while, it is to be feared, not a few, under the pretence
of family cares, do not communicate so often as once in the year.
	Societies for Religious Purposes.--At the head of these may be

Vigeans. It has been in active operation upwards of twenty years.
Dissenters are admitted to teach in its schools, but only on the
condition of declaring their adherence to the doctrinal standards of
the Established church. A library of 1100 volumes is connected
with the institution; and, besides the ordinary religious books for

1030. The population of the district, included within the field of
the society's operations, is 14,078; so that 1 of 13 2/3 of the exist-
ing population is receiving Sabbath school instruction. The re-
ports of the society do not distinguish the number of scholars resid-
ing respectively in the parishes of Arbroath and St Vigeans. But
the enumeration of the inhabitants of the parish of Arbroath in
1831, exhibited, in regard to this, the following result:
