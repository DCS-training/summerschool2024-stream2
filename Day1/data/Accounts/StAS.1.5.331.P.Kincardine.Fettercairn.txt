are highly commodious to the tenants, and ornamental to the
country.  A great part of the parish is inclosed with ditch
and hedge.  There is of late, a great quantity of ash, fir, and
birch trees planted.  The greatest exertion in this way is
made upon the lands of Wotton and Burn, belonging to
Lord Adam Gordon.  There are 600 acres planted on his
estate.  His Lordship has built a very elegant house, of mo-
derate dimensions, but exceedingly substantial work.  It
stands at a small distance from the river Northeik, along
the side of which, there is a very long walk of the most
beautiful kind.  The money Lord Adam Gordon has ex-
pended, in planting and building, has given employment to
many work people, and adorned a very barren part of this
parish.  In due course of time, these improvements, it is 
hoped, will be profitable, as well as ornamental.

   Extent, Heritors, and Rent.-By a general measurement
taken in 1774, there are 14,359 English acres.  The real

book is L.6533: 3: 3 Scotch.  Four estates, have gone by
purchase, to new proprietors, since 1775.- There are 8 heri-
tors connected with the parish, of whom 4 occasionally re-
side in it.
