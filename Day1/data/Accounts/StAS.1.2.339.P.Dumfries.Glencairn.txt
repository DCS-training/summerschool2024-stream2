     of Glencairn.

     NUMBER XXVII.

     PARISH OF GLENCAIRN.

     (COUNTY OF DUMFRIES.)

     By the Rev. Mr. WILLIAM GRIERSON.

     Name, Situation, etc.
   Glencairn has always been reckoned one of the most
considerable country parishes, in the south of Scotland,
for extent, valuation, and number of inhabitants.  It lies in the
presbytery of Penpont, and sydod of Galloway, about ten com-
puted miles from Dumfries.  The length, from east to west,
is about 11 computed miles:  The breadth varies.  To the
west, it lies along three small rivers, called Castlefairn, Craig-
darroch, and Dalwhat; which, are divided from each other,
by very high and steep hills, mostly green, and meet at the
village of Minniehive, which is the only one in the district,
about two miles from the church.  The rest of the parish lies
on both sides of the Cairn, the name by which the three rivers,
thus united is known:  and Glencairn seems to be so called,
from the great hollow or glen, along which the river passes,
and a huge cairn, or heap of stones, of unknown antiquity,
where it first has the name of Cairn given to it.
