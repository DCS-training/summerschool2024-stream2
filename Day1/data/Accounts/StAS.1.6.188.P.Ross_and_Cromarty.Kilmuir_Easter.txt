rent does not much exceed L. 1400 sterling.  The land next
the shore lets at 20 s. per acre, and near the vilage of Miln-
town 30 b. and upwards is paid for small lots; but more remote
from the shore, the farmers, on an average, pay no more than
15s. per acre.  -The proprietors begin to see the advantage of
granting leases to their tenants, and to convert the half of the
victual rent into money, at 14s. per boll, including customs
and services.

   Number of Proprietors, etc.-There are 6 proprietors; 3
either occasionally or constantly reside in the parish: 15 small
scuars in the village of Milntown, most of whom have no more
than 1/4 of an acre each; 17 larger, and about 40 smaller te-
nants; and a great number of new settlers, paying from 5 s to
20 s. rent each.  There are 4 shop-keepers, 3 distillers, 12 ma-
sons, 4 cart-wrights. 1 cooper, 6 house-carpenters, 4 black-
smiths, 1 carpet waever, 2 stocking waevers, 15 common wae-
vers, 10 taylors, 10 shoe-makers, and 20 lime-makers.  The pa-

the people, and has been pretty successful for 30 years in that
branch; so that all the women, old and young, are become
dexterous at the spinning wheel, and have greatly increased
their yearly income by it.  A stocking manufactory was lately
introduced to the parish, under the patronage of Sir John
Lockart Ross, which did not meet with that encouragement
which might be expected.  It is now carried on solely by Mr
Montgomery, who seems to think, that it will not prove a
profitable trade in this country for some time.
