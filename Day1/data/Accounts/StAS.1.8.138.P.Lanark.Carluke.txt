wards.-In the year 1789, the orchards in this parish produced
such a plentiful crop, as to yield in all, for fruit, above 500 L.
Sterling, besides about 200 L. for the under growth.-On March
12th 1782, the river Clyde rose so high (being, in the more
confined places, about 4 feet higher than ever known), that
several mills on the other side were swept away, and the ground
on this side much damaged, by being cut with the stream,
and covered with gravel.  In the same year, and also in
1783, the people in this parish, like many others, were in
very great want of grain, occasioned by the general failure of
the crops.  What they had from their farms, was much da-
maged, especially on the higher grounds; but, by occasional
supplies of pease from Leith, and the kind attention and libe-
ral contributions of the more opulent heritors, the poor here
were so well provided for, that none of them suffered from
want.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The principal disadvan-
tages, under which this parish labours, appear to be the fol-
lowing:-Though the ground stands much in need of dung,
and some of it cannot be made very productive by lime alone,
yet, by lying at a distance from large towns, that sort of ma-
nure cannot easily be procured, but in the small quantities
which the farmers themselves produce.-This being a clayey
country, in some places, during the drought of summer, the
cattle are at a loss for want of water, and are thereby liable
to certain diseases, well known to the farmer, which, in the
woody part of the country, are particularly prevalent.-As
there is a continual drain from the parish, both of young men
and women, to the neighbouring cotton mills, iron works, &c.
the farmer is often at a loss for labourers; and servants wages
are thereby rendered much higher, than the master can well
