we discovered a few inches below the ground; there was
a most luxuriant crop of pease and beans, both of grain and
fodder.  The pease, after they were cut down, were fre-
quently covered with snow, and in turning them a great
part of the grain was lost; I waited till near the end of
November, and seeing no prospect of preserving them in the
ordinary manner, I took three Norway trees, of 10 or
12 feet in length, tied them at the top with a rope, and ex-
tended them at the base; the pease were built round the
trees on the outside, four small arches were left at the bot-
tom, all was hollow within the trees, and open at the top
before the rick was thatched; the air rushed in, went to
the top, and in a few days the straw, which was formerly
wet, was as dry in the inside as on the outside; the whole
crop of pease was contained in three ricks; the grain that
remained, and straw, was entirely preserved; and if the
experiment had been tried sooner, the whole of the grain
would have been saved.  After the pease were threshed
out, I offered the straw for sale in 1785, at 3 d. each stone;
I only sold at that time a few stones; in 1786, there was a
scarcity of fodder; I fold the pease straw at 4 d. each stone;
the farmers had suspicions at first of its being spoiled from
age, and rotten, and were slow in purchasing it; it was
however soon sold, and the person who bought the last part
of it came to me smiling, and said he had not bought cheap-
er or fresher fodder that winter, and that his horses ap-
peared to he exceedingly fond of it.  This method of pre-
serving pease is very simple, but notwithstanding of this
circumstance, and though it is perfectly understood, and
frequently practiced in the higher parts of the county,
where there is plenty of timber, and was pretty generally
known in this corner at the time, I have never seen it re-
peated, and I am acquainted with many instances of pease
being entirely lost since that year.  The want of timber
