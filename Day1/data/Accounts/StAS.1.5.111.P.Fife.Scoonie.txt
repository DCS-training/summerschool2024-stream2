not suiting his superior genius, he soon converted his little stock
into books, and, for some years, went through the country,
and attended the fairs as an itinerant book seller.  There is great
reason to believe, that he engaged in this new species of traf-

St Andrew's, on an application to the College, by the
Rector of the school of Dunkeld, for an assistant, Mr Stone
was recommended as the best qualified for that office; and
