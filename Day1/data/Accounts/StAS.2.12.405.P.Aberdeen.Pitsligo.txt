from it, for those not on the gratis list of the parish schoolmaster,
have their fees paid by the kirk-session.
   Literature.-There is a library connected with the parish school,
which was established about two years ago, and now contains 100
volumes.  With a view to promote and encourage a taste for read-
ing, the rate of subscription was made upon the lowest possible
scale,-so low, indeed, as to be altogether inadequate for the pur-
chase of such a stock of books as is required to keep pace with
the growing desire for information among the juvenile and even
among the grown-up portion of the community.
   Friendly Societies.-There are several Friendly Societies in
this parish, viz. Masons, Wrights, Shoemakers, Gardeners, and Fish-
ers, many of them of long standing, and distributing large sums
annually to widows and aged indigent members.  That of the Ma-
sons, entitled the Forbes Lodge of Masons, was instituted in
1775, and pays to sick and superannuated members, with widows
and orphans, annually, no less a sum than L. 70.  The others dis-
tribute in all about L. 30.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The following tables show the
state of the poor, the number of them relieved, collections and
distributions, &c. for the years 1835-36-37, as rendered to the
Church Commissioners :

   The above expenditure does not include the session-clerk's fee
of L. 3 per annum, nor that of the church officer of L. 2, nor pos-
tages, stamps, &c.
   The average sum given to the poor on the roll is 19s. 2d; to
those occasionally relieved, 10s. 6d.  The lowest sum given per
quarter is 5s. ; the highest, at present, is 3s. per week.
   It may be added, that numerous donations and legacies have
been paid to the session of Pitsligo, for behoof of the poor, since
the commencement of the present century.
   The late James Brown, Esq. M. D., son of the late Mr Brown
Boghead, left a sum of L. 100, the interest of which is to be laid
