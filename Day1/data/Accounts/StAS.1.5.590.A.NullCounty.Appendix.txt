Governor and Council in London, and a Committee of
Management at Glasgow; who meet monthly, or oftener
as occasion may require.  Both of these are chosen by a
general meeting at London, in the month of March yearly.

   At the first of January 1791, the Company had expend-
ed in this undertaking above L.330,000; the aqueduct
bridge over the Kelvin alone having cost L. 8509.

   Since the year 1777, the tonnage and wharfage dues
have been greatly on the increase, but more particularly
so, since the junction of the two seas in July 1790; as the
communication between Ireland and the east sea is thereby
shortened above 800 miles.  The gross revenues this year
(1792) are expected to exceed L. 14,000; in consequence of
which, the original shares in the Company's stock are now
selling 25 per cent. above par.
