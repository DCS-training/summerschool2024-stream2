indigenous and exotic, are all in a peat-moss, where water
stagnates from 1 foot to 2 under the surface."  This Lord
Kaimes advances as a proof, that "a plant may acquire a
constitution fitting it for growing partly in earth, partly in
water."  But the kitchen-garden and flower-garden at Kem-
nay, are not in a peat-moss.  On the contrary, the soil of
both is a light mould, very shallow, and lying on sand of a
deep brown colour.  It is true that the wilderness is in a
peat-moss, and that almost all the trees, both indigenous and
exotic, that have been planted in it, have come away with
extraordinary rapidity.  But the tap roots stop immediately
when they come to the stagnant water, that is, to the quick
moss, as we call it, and push no further  The other roots
shoot horizontally to a great distance from the tree, but never
go below the dry or dead part of the moss.  It is necessary to
observe farther, that in planting in peat-moss, it is always
found expedient here, to throw into the pit that is dug for
the reception of the plant, a certain quantity of good earth,
either loam or mould, among which it takes root; and that
in no instance has a tree been observed to vegetate above 2 or
3 years, where this was omitted.

   Air, Climate.-Notwithstanding the abundance of peat-
moss in this parish, which has, doubtless, rather a bad effect
upon the air, the inhabitants, in general, are not unhealthy.
The greater number of the little villages in which they live,
is in elevated situations.  No local distemper has ever been
known to prevail among them, unless that kind of dropsy
which physicians call the anasarca, and which frequently ap-
pears here, may be called such.  This disorder, however, is
seldom mortal, as it yields to a very simple cure, if the old
advice is followed, "venienti occurrite morbo."
