Thus he loves all that time in which he ought to pro-
vide manure for his land; and though there is lime-

yet he can derive no benefit from it.   Several of the
proprietors, however, have cummuted their services.
Were this mode generally adopted, and the tenants

the proprietors.  The scheme was this:  The herritors
entered into a private subscription among themselves,
out of which a premium was paid for every animal or
