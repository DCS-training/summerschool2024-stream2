   Husbandry.-The number of black-cattle, not including
the calves, is 2488; the number of sheep, 4000; the num-
ber of horses, 348.  The different kinds of cattle are of a
small breed, which adapts them well to the rough ground
on which they pasture.  There is very little corn raised in
this parish.  Their small crops are sown in the months of
April and May, and reaped in September and October.
The inhabitants rely principally on fish for their subsist-
ence.

   Language.-The Gaelic language is their mother tongue;
many of the names of places are derived from the Danish
and Norwegian languages.

   Rent.-The land-rent of the parish is L.1020, 5 s.

   Ecclesiasical State of the Parish.-The value of the mi-
nister's living, including the globe, is L.80. The King is

and was settled there three years ago.  His immediate pre-
decessor was John Frazer; before whom were James Wil-
son, Alexander Mackay, and Colin Mackenzie, who was
the first minister of the parish. The present incumbent is
married, and has 3 boys and a girl.  A new manse, two
