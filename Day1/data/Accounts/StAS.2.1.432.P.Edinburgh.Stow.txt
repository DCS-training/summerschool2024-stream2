with each L. 13, 14s.= L. 1, 2s. 10d. Sterling. In other places
men's "fie and bounteth" maybe stated at L. 18 and L. 19, while
women vary from L. 10 to L. 13.
   In comparing the number of souls on the same farm or property
then and now, the increase would seem to be in the proportion of
5 to 4. Where there were 15 or 16, there are now 20; but in
some cases the numbers are nearly doubled. This increase is to be
ascribed to the great extension of agriculture, and especially to tur-
nip husbandry, which in summer requires so many hands, and was
then altogether unknown. These incidental facts throw some light
on the question regarding the increase of population for the last
century, a matter on which I find some very intelligent men have
been doubtful.
   Curiosities of former times.-To John Bortliwick, Esq. of Crook-
ston, I am indebted for the perusal of a MS. (bound tip with that
on the poll-tax) exhibiting the family expenses 1685-1696. The
following matters selected, and sometimes compressed, may, it is
hoped, not be unworthy of the title under which they are placed.
   To a tailor in Dalkeith, "Stuff to be Cruikstone a coat, lining
&c. L. 4, 3s. = 6s. 11d. Sterling." The coat was of course made
by a tailor in the house, according to the custom of the time.
   1690. "Cruikstone for shoes to himself, L. 1, 6s. = 2s. 2d.
Sterling. Jan. 1691. Cruikstone for a new batt, L. 2, 18s. =
4s. 10d." The high price of muslin, &c. appears by the following:
"2 ellns muslin, L. 2, 14s. = 4s. 6d. Sterling; 2 1/2 ellns a la mode,
L. 4, 16s." = 8s. In 1685, we have the item, "10 loads of lyme,"
(3 carts now) L,2, 10s. or 10s. a cart; "item, postage of 2 let-
ters from Holland, L. 1, 8s. = 2s. 4d. Sterling.
   The sums paid for law and medicine appears enormous in pro-
portion to other things. Large sums were paid also to the ser-
vants of gentlemen of these professions. Witness the following:
   "Feb 1686. Consulting Sir John Dalrymple and Master John
Stewart concerning provision for the laird's sister, 6 dollars each,
inde, L. 34, 16s; item to there first and second servants, L. 10, 3s.;
item, to Sir John Dalrymples door-keeper, (footman acting as por-
ter), 14s.; consulting two lawyers on another occasion L. 52, 4s.;
their servants, L. 13 4s.; another "consulting," L. 14, 10s., and
first and second servants, L. 4, 7s. an agent before the sheriff, L. 3
12s,; "item to his servant," 14s.; agent's salary for 1686, L. 60;
his servant for the said year, L. 5, 16s.
   The charge of gentlemen of the pestle and mortar, how-
