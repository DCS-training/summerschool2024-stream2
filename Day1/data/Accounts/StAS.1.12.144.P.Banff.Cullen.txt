the segment of a circle on the W. and S.  The face of the
country is neither hilly nor flat; in general the fields have
an easy gentle slope.  The soil is of 3 kinds; the greatest
part is a fine rich loam, upon a soft clay bottom; some fields
of a strong rich clay, and a few of a light loam, upon a tilly
bottom.  As the fields in general are dry, and as the bills in
the neighbouring parishes of Rathven and Deskford attract the
clouds and vapours that arise from the sea, the air of this pa-
rish is pure and extremely wholesome; as a proof of this, ma-
ny of the inhabitants live and enjoy comfortable health, till
far past 80, and severals above 90 years.  And no local or epi-

is become mild, and in no proportion so fatal as in former
times; bat this may be owing to the greater degree of clean-

of that loathsome distemper.

   Agriculture.-The farms are small, from 5 L. to 50 L. of
rent, and the fine field about the town is let in small lots, to
accommodate the inhabitants.  Although the soil is fit to pro-
duce any kind of grain, yet the crops generally raised are,
oats, barley, pease, beans, turnip, potatoes, sown grass and
flax.  Flax seems to be a precarious crop upon the east coast
of Scotland; the soil and climate are too dry for it, but in a
moist season there are good crops.  This observation might,
perhaps, be worthy the attention of landholders and farmers
in mother climates, where crops of corn are more precarious,
to encourage the culture of flax; especially as it is an early
crop, and fit for pulling before the season of the mildews, so
fatal to grain, generally sets in.  The average rent of the land
is from 10 s to 2 L. 10 s. the acre.  The only plough used
