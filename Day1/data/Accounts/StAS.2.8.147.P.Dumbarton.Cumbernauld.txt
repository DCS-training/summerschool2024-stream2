doors, or renting minister's gowns, leat they bring trouble upon
themselves by such disorderly practises."-Although removed af-
ter the Revolution, Mr Muschett seems to have remained within
the parish,-for so late as 1715, the record bears that several per-
sons were cited to the session for being irregularly married by him,
and censured for the same.
   As far down as 1721, the meetings of session are dated at Easter
Leinzie. The next entry in the record being the commencement
of Mr Oughterson's incumbency, is dated Cumbernauld, 7th May
1727, which is the name which the parish now bears.
   Parochial Registers.-The parish register for marriages and
births begins 10th April 1688, and though much decayed seems to
have been accurately kept till 1722. At this time, the parish seems
to have been as populous as at present; from 1688 to 1693, the
average number of registrations of births being above 100; from
1693 to 1700, about 90; from that to 1705, about 70. From
this period the number gradually decreases, especially from the
time of the Secession: for the five years ending with 1735, the
average is 56; do. ending with 1750, about 43; do. ending with
1765, about 38.
   The number of marriages about the end of the seventh
century, averages about 23 only. From this time to 1722, there
are frequent interruptions; and downwards, are total blanks in the
registers; and in the same interrupted and irregular way, the record
is continued to 1801. From this time, it has been carefully and
pretty regularly kept, though the number of registrations does not
give the exact number of births or baptisms, which is occasioned
by the Secession ministers keeping a register for their own congre-
gations.
  There is no registration of burials before 1817. Since this time,
one has been kept with great accuracy. During the seven years
ending 1831, the average of births was 67 8/7; deaths, 48 5/7; marri-
ages, 24 6/7. It is worthy of remark, that during the year ending
31st December 1831, the deaths exceeded the births by one, the
births being 73 and the burials 74. From the great mortality in
1832, the same excess occurred. These, however, are rare oc-
currences, for though the situation be high, and the climate moist,
the parish is by no means unhealthy. Several individuals now liv-
ing are considerably above eighty, two or three about ninety years,
and some others died lately at this advanced period of life.
