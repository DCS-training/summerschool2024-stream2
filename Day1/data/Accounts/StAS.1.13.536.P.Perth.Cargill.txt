many cases to trace accurately the monuments they have
left behind them.  This road, however, which is about 20
feet broad, and composed of rough round stones rudely laid
together, can be plainly traced from Innerpeffry, through
the parish of Gask, (where there is a camp), to Duplin
Parks: from thence to Bertha few vestiges of it can be
discovered.  About a quarter of a mile above Bertha,
(which seems to have been a Roman station from the num-
ber of urns that have been discovered there), a ridge of
stones which extend far into the river, and a great number
of large oak-trees which have been dug up there, and
many of which still remain in the water, give strong ap-
pearances of a military Roman bridge over the Tay there.
From thence the road is to be traced to Rome, (which pro-
bably got its name at that time), past Sherifftown and In-
nerbuilt, where there is a large camp and several tumuli,
through the parish of St Martin's to Byres, keeping the
ridge of the hill through the estate of Stobhall, and passing
near Gallowhill, where it is very discernible, it bends its
course to the Ila at Windyedge, where the remains of an-
other military bridge are distinctly to be traced, and the
houses adjacent to which still go by the name of Bridgend.
This bridge seems to have communicated with different
Roman stations, which are to be seen in different places on
the extensive plain on the other side of the river towards
Blairgowrie, where the Romans, as Boethius informs us,
fought a bloody battle with the united armies of the Cale-
donians and Picts.  When this military road was made is
uncertain; probably by the army at Ardoch, to preserve a
communication between their different camps, and as con-
venient for their after marches had they conquered the
country*.-An old custom takes place in this parish. called
