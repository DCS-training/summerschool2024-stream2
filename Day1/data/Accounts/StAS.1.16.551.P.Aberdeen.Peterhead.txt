fish, called seaths, podlers and baddocks; which appear to
be of one species.  Mackarel is likewise found here in great
perfection, and sells from 1 d. to 2 d. each.  They are ge-
nerally caught with a white feather fastened on a hook,
the boat sailing with a quick motion.  The usual bait for
fish caught here, are haddocks, flounder, cod, sand eels
limpets, log, shrimps, mussels arid crabs.  The mussels are
brought from the Newburgh at the mouth of the Ythan,
about fifteen miles from this place.

   Fishing Towns.-There are two fishing towns in this pa-

few feet only from the brink of it.  There are six caves
betwixt the town and the southern boundary of this pa-
rish.  Some of them are very high, and run in within the
land sixty yards; one of them is immediately below the
town, and some of the houses are above the arch.  In the
caves, vast numbers of pigeons and cormorants constantly
reside.

boundary of the bay of Invernettie on the north, is said to
