habitants.  With respect to those on ale and malt, it ought
not to pass unobserved, that they have for a long time gradu-
ally decreased, and do not now yield a sum equal to its produce
in 1745, when the parish did not contain above 6000 people.
In that year the town's grant, of two pennies on the pint of ale,
is laid to have yielded 500 L. In  1757 it gave 4231 L. 9 s. and
its produce in 1791 was no more than 3261. 6 s.; this dif-
ference is supposed to arise, in a great measure, from the va-
rious taxes; by which the malt liquor here has been so much
debased, that it ceases to be the drink used in social meetings,
or for refreshment from the fatigues of labour; and the people,
deprived of their ancient, exhilerating, and wholesome beve-
rage, have recourse to intoxicating and enervating spirituous
liquors.  The increased use of there is certainly a most alarm-
ing circumstance.  They are fold in no less than 179 licensed
houses; and the number non-licensed ones, where they may
be procured, is believed to be very great; whereas formerly'
the town was sufficiently, and perhaps, too well supplied by
five or six.

   Shipping, Exports, Imports, etc.-On the 5th of January
1792, there were 116 vessels, belonging to the port, navigated
by 698 men, and measuring 8550 1/2 tons.  Of there, 34 were
employed in the foreign, and 78 in the coasting trade, and 4
in the whale fishery.  By Mr. Hunter, clerk of the customs, the
author of this account has been favoured with the following
comparative state of some of the principal articles of trade,
in the years 1745 and 1791.
