qualified for the ministry.  He seems to have served the cure not-
withstanding; and in May 1654,, he was, without further trials, or
any deed of induction, received into fraternity as a member of
Presbytery; and his name is found in the sederants down to 4th
September 1660.  After the restoration he was outed for non-
conformity; but Mr Sharpe, his editor, in the short account of his
life prefixed to the " Memorialls," states that, though he did not
subscribe the indulgence, yet he returned to his charge on the
passing of that act; and he quotes a minute of council, from which
it appears that, in 1679, on the petition of Andrew Colquhoun of
Garscadden, and Hugh Crawfurd of Cloberhill, in name of the
people of Easter Kilpatrick, Mr Law was continued minister of
the parish.  We know not how to reconcile this statement with the
evidence of the Presbytery records, which show that Mr William
Duncan, a conformist, was minister of this parish from the year
1666 to the date of the Revolution.  The ministers in succession
to him have been--Mr John Dougal, admitted 31st December.
1690, died 23d December 1712; Mr John Logan, admitted 15th
September 1715, died 18th January 1730; Mr Andrew Gray,
admitted 18th March 1731, died l0th February 1776; Mr James
Carrick, admitted 31st October 1776, died 28th February 1787;
Mr George Sym, admitted 20th December 1787, died 29th May
1835.  The present incumbent was ordained assistant and succes-
sor to his father, 27th September 1821.
   Principal Families.--At an early period the family of Galbraith
had extensive possessions in Lennox, and William Galbraith of
Garteonnel is noticed as a person " of good account" in the time
of David II. about the middle of the fourteenth century. *  Gart-
connel is now known only as a farm belonging to Mr Gordon of
Dugalstone; but the site of an ancient castle or keep is still mark-
ad out by the surrounding fosse.
   Douglas of Mains.--Janet Galbraith, daughter and co-heiress
of James, or perhaps rather of the above William Galbraith of
Gartconnel, married in 1373 Nicholas Douglas, fourth son Of
James, first Lord of Dalkeith, (grandson of William, Lord of
Douglas, the companion in arms of Wallace.)  By this marriage
he aquired the estate of Mains, and other considerable posses-
sions in Lennox; and from him the present proprietor is descended
in the fifteenth generation.  Malcolm Douglas of Mains, the eighth
in descent from Nicholas, is known in the History of Scotland as
