2751. In 1792, it had diminished to 2568.  In 1831, it had
increased to 4054, and, in 1841, to 5369.  The number (in
1841) residing in the original parish of Glassary, was, males,
1355, and females, 1295; total, 2630.  Families, 504. At-
tacbed to the Government church of Lochgilphead, were, males,
1345, females, 1394; total, 2739.  Families, 562. Making in all,
males, 2690, females, 2689; total, 5369. Families, 1066.
  The increase in the population shown by the above returns has
taken place entirely in the village of Lochgilphead, which has in-
creased rapidly within the last thirty years, and is still increasing.
The rural population, there is reason to believe, has been dimi-
nisbing rather than increasing, as not only have emigration and the
enlargement of farms so operated, in this as in other parts of the
Highlands; but the principal proprietor has taken upon himself
the management of a great portion of his lands, placing workmen
and managers in them instead of tenants and cottars; an experi-
ment which may require to be watched, lest it give rise to a
population which may eventually be as poor, and not more easily
maintained or more beneficial to the community, than that
which has been dispensed with. The cottar and the crofter
systems are liable to much abuse, and where unrestrained must
ever bring down the character of the peasantry to the low-
est level; but it is difficult for the farmer to carry on work
where he can find no extra labourer of whose aid he can avail
bimself at a busy season; and it might therefore conduce to the
interests of all, if the building of a cottage or the allotment of a
piece of ground to a poor man were carefully considered rather
than altogether prevented.
  Very often the cottars who leave the rural districts here take
Up their abode in the village.
  The average * number of baptisms registered annually in Glas-
sary for the three years ending January 1844, was 103; and of
marriages for the same period, 26 annually. It is believed that
these returns are not strictly accordant with the actual number,
especially of births, because there is an impression that the regis-
ters are purely ecclesiastical documents, kept by order of the ec-
clesiastical and not of the civil authorities,--and that if the offi-
ciating ministers insist not upon it, the interests of the parties do
not render the expense necessary.
