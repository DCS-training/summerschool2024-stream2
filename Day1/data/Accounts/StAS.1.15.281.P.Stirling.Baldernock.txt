     of Baldernock.

These were by the people held in high esteem, and called Senae,
or venerable women, words nearly synonymous to the Scots
word Auld wives.  Hence we are induced to conclude, that this
is one of those lifted stones, Pierres levées; and that it is called
the Auldwive's lift, because it was the lifted stone where
the Senae, or sisterhood of venerable female Druids residing
here, paid their devotions.  Upon the supposition, also, that
this was a seat of the Druid worship, we have suggested to
us a very probable etymology of the name of the parish.  Bal,
in the Gaelic language signifies town, and Druinich, of or
belonging to the Druids.  The present name, Baldernock, is
not a greater corruption of Baldruinich, i. e. Druidstown,
than might be expected in the lapse of eighteen hundred
years.
