not precisely say, neither can I well find.  But they shew,
in general, that this country was once a theatre of iniquity,
bloodshed, and violence; natives oppressing and plundering
natives, and foreign rapacious adventurers making a prey
of them all.  There is not one of theso antiquities that has
the least appearance of being the habitation of peace and
security.  Surely they cost immense labour and expence in
building and defending them, and the people could not be
weak or few in those days.  For the manifest design of
them required a great number of hands, and strong ones
too, to accomplish it; but how they were supported and
maintained, when the most of their time and labour must
have been ingrossed by these machinations offensive and de-
fensive, is a mystery which I cannot pretend to solve: for
in such a state of affairs, though a great number of people
and great expence was necessarily required for these purpo-
ses, yet very few hands, and very little time and industry
could be spared for the purposes of life; and surely, when
they fought so well, and so frequently in those days, they
must have eat and drank well also; but how or whence
they got these necessary fupplies is, at this distance of time,
hard to account for; for the people then, as appears by the
monuments they left behind them, lived more by plunder
and rapine, than by industry and cultivating the field.  It
is true, indeed, fishing and hunting, and the beasts of pa-
sture, would furnish a considerable supply, as there was
better game and fishing, and more cattle and pasture than
are now.  It is true also, that the foreign adventurers of the
north would bring some money and provisions along with
them.  After all, it is still a mystery, and so I leave it.
   Yet so it is, that the people were then numerous, and
very robust, and well supported, otherwise they could not
carry on and atchieve what they did.  Their houses, or
