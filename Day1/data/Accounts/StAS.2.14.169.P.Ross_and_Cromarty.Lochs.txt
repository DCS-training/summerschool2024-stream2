from which they prepare this fuel, is, in many instances, no more
than fifty feet from the dwelling houses of the people; though, in a
few other instances, it is a full mile distant. The labour of pre-
paring this fuel chiefly devolves on the female part of the popula-
tion, with the single exception of cutting the peats out of the moss,
and spreading them on the ground to dry, which is done by the
males.
              MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
he people of Lochs differs materially from
what it was'. when the last Statistical Account was published.
Then, very few of them could read; but now, the half of them, from
the ages of ten to thirty years, can read the Scriptures in their mo-
ther tongue. This happy change has been brought about, by means-
of the Gaelic School Society. Indeed, the proprietor and proprie-
tress of this island are very energetic in disseminating a know-
ledge of the oracles of truth among their poor tenants. But, from
a change in the times, and other circumstances, the poor people
are much reduced in circumstances. The fishing, which formerly
constituted a chief part of their support, has not been prosperous
of late years; but the mainspring of their prosperity was the price-
of cattle, which has also failed. This, together with, the warm
entreaties of their acquaintances and friends who emigrated to
Nova Scotia in former years, seems to have inspired them with
the spirit of emigration; and nothing but reluctance to part with
their scanty stocks of cattle, at the present very low prices, seems
to retard the emigration of a great many of the people of Lochs
this year, to British North America.
