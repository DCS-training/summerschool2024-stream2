owing to the more regular behaviour of the people, and
their being in more comfortable circumstances.  A proof of
which is, that early marriages are very frequent, and which,
naturally, prevent irregularities.  Here, it may be obser-
ved, that 80 men were raised in 1793, for the First Fen-
cible Regiment; and there are now in the parish two com-
panies of volunteers; one in Urquharr, of 60, and the other
in Glenmoriston, of 40 men.

   Poor.-In Urquhart there are scarcely any travelling
poor.  About 30 receive aid from the session funds, which
are the ordinary collections on Sundays, penalties for tres-
passes, (which are seldom), and the interest of L. 100 of
mortifications and former savings, amounting, in all, to
about L. 15 a-year; but out of which the session-clerk and
kirk-officer are paid L. 2 : 4 : 6: the remainder is divided
according to the several exigencies of the poor.
   The Glenmoriston poor beg more generally from home
than their neighbours of Urquhart, and they are more in
number, in proportion to the inhabitants.  Their funds are
the interest of about L. 25 of morifications and bequests,
and the Sunday collections and fines, amounting, at an ave-
rage, to L. 3, besides the interest of the above L. 25.
   The funds of each glen are kept separate, and the poor
of Urquhart receive nothing from Glenmoriston, nor those
of Glenmoriston from Urquhart.  In Urquhart, a quarterly
collection is usually made for bed-rids, and other great ob-

makes a part of the aggregate fund; but bed-rids, etc. get
a much larger proportion.  In severe seasons, and to objects
of great distress, the heritors and other gentlemen are ex-
tremely liberal and charitable.  In the noted 1782, so much
