the parish of Muthil; from Dean's Lundie, and Deanstown,

   The number of poor upon the roll of this parish is 34.
Some years it has been above 40.  They are maintained by
assessments.  These commenced in 1775.  The number of
poor then upon the roll was 19; and the assessment 7 s. 6 d.
was on the 100 L Scotch of valued rent.  The assessment has
gradually risen to 20 s. on the 100 L Scotch.  Last assessment
was fixed at 15 s.  The deficiency is made up from the interest
of money mortified for behoof of the poor.  Occasional cha-
rities, given by the kirk-session to poor householders not on
the roll, amount to about 5 L per annum.  These are given
out of the collections at the church-doors, dues of mort-
cloths, etc.

   Crops.-The principal crops are oats and barley.  A con-
siderable quantity of flax and potatoes, also of clover and rye-
grass, are sown in this parish.  More grain of every kind
(except wheat, which is sown only in small quantities) than
what is necessary for the maintenance of its inhabitants, is
raised in this district.

   Roads and Bridges.-The roads were originally made by
the statute labour; but it is hardly sufficient to keep them in
repair.  The great military road to the north passes through
nearly the length of this parish; and being one of the great-
est thoroughfares in Scotland, would require more than the
statute labour to keep it in sufficient repair.  Many of the
landed gentlemen are of opinion, that it should be made a
turnpike; but this has been prevented by a different opinion
