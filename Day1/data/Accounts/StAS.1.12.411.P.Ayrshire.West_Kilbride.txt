ring and cod fishery; each boat had 4 men, when at the her-
ring-fishing.  From the month of July to October, they were
all occupied in this branch.  In the months of February and 
March, about dozen of these boats, doubly manned, stretch-
ed away to the coasts of Galloway, Ireland, and Cantire, in
search of cod, ling, and oysters.  The number of men em-
ployed in these fisheries, when in their most flourishing state,
could not be less than 150; and the average sum acquired
upon them both, might amount to about 600 L. Sterling.  For
many years, however, this trade was on the decline, and the
few boats that remained, when depopulations, to be mention-
ed in the sequel, took place, were, in consequence suppressed;
since that time, no attention has been paid to it and the art
seems now totally lost.

   Rent, Farms, etc.-The real rent of this parish is 2528 L.
Sterling.  There are abut 40 farms in it, which let from
300 L. to 36 L.  There are 19 heritors, of which, 2 of the
greater, and 8 of the lesser, are non-resident.  The number
of sheep is 2000; the most of them are the small black-faced
breed.  A few of the English breed have been introduced,
and are multiplying fast.  The wool of the sheep, whose
walk is upon the shore, is of a siner quality than that of
those who graze upon the hilly grounds, and sells for at least
a third more.  The sheep upon the higher walks are laid
with tar, those upon the lower are not, which perhaps, may
be one reason of this difference in the pile of the wool.  The
average quantity of wool sold off the different walks, is a 
about 625 stones yearly.  The pasture in this parish, is re-
markably favourable for feeding; and both the mutton and
beef fattened upon it, upon account of their superior quanlity
in point of flavour and sweetness, ahve the preference in every
market where they are exposed.  Of black cattle, there are
