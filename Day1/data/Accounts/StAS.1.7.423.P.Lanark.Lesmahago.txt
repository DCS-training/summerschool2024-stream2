and Lesmahagoe meet.  This is a beautiful pastoral stream;
the banks of which are finely diversified with hanging woods,
sloping pastures, and cornfields.  The Ponicle runs along the
south border of the parish, till it falls into the Douglas river;
and afterwards the united river, the banks of which are high-
ly picturesque, forms the boundary on that side.  The little
river Kype divides this from the parish of Avondale.  The
Calner, which runs northward, and separating the parishes of
Stonehouse and Dalserf, falls into the Avon, takes its rise in
the western part of this parish, in the estate of Blackwood,
by the proprietors of which its banks have been adorned
with stately groves of forest trees.  Besides these, number-
less brooks, and fountains of the purest water, flow from the
sides of every hill.
   In the Nethan and Logan, as well as the rivers by which
the parish is bounded, are found plenty of trout and silver
eel.  Salmon, also, from the Clyde, go up the Nethan, and
even to the Logan, in the month of August, and spawn
there; but a cruive now put across the mouth of the first,
obstructs them greatly, and is likewise thought to have dimi-
nished the number of trouts.

   Air.-The situation of the parish being elevated, the air is
somewhat moist, and so cold and sharp as greatly to retard
the progress of vegetation in the spring, consequently the
harvest is not early.  In autumn, too, the frosty vapours
settle in the narrow plains in the neighbourhood of the
mountains, and frequently injure the crops.  The air, how-
ever, seems not to be unsavourahle to animal life.  The inha-
bitants are healthy and robust, little subject to diseases.
There are several instances of vigorous longevity among them;
from which the following is selected as being known to the
writer.  J-Porteous, about 20 years ago, after having
compleated the hundredth year of his age, walked from his
