     Statistical Account

W. side, the ground rises still more gradually for about 8
miles westward, till it reaches the summit of Grange of Co-
nan hill, where the parish borders on Carmylie.  The rest of
the parish may be said to be pretty flat, with a few gentle
elevations in different places.
   There is no map of the parish; but by a pretty exact in-
vestigation, aided by information from the proprietor and
farmers, it is found to contain about 9385 Scotch acres; in-
cluding the 2 detached estates above mentioned; 8355 acres
of which are arable, of which 2334 acres are enclosed, the
greater part with ditch, and the rest with hedge and ditch;
1359 acres enclosed with stone fences; 250 acres planted,
chiefly with Scotch firs; 780 acres of moor, of which there
are above 300 acres under improvement already, and more
will soon be taken in for cultivation; and, it is thought, that
in a few years there will be no moor remaining in the parish.
The number of enclosed acres will appear more surprising,
when it is observed, that in the year 1754, there were not
40 acres, gardens excepted, enclosed in the parish.
   There are, in the parish, 138 carts, 300 horses, 132 ploughs,
1633 black cattle, 510 sheep, a few of which are of English
breed, and 30 swine.  There are about 127 bolls of pease
sown yearly in the parish; 140 bolls wheat; 976 bolls barly
and common bear; 1578 bolls of oats.  The yearly returns,
at an average, may be 9 of wheat, 5 or 6 oats, and 7 or
8 of barley.  But perhaps this calculation may be rather
high for the W. side of the parish; but, it is thought, the E.
side will make up the deficiency.  The valued rent of the
parish is 8299 L. 6 s. 8 d. Scots, which is the highest valuation
of a country parish in this county, and the real rent about
6000 guineas; the number of proprietors about 40; the
feaurs some hundreds.  The highest valuation of any heritor
is 1200 L. Scots, and the lowest 2 L. Scots.  Ten heritors re-
