   Character of the People-The people of-Campbelton, in
their dress and manners, differ little from those of other sea-
port towns in the kingdom, of the same magnitude.  They
are, in general, orderly and well behaved; courteous to
strangers, and kind to the poor.  They afford perhaps too

less necessary, than the early instilling of good principles;
the temper and conduct of men, being at least as much re-
gulate by habit as by principle.  But it is not to these ge-
neral causes, that the evil, complained of here, is to be chiefly
attributed, but to the want of schools in the country; to
