steeple of the same form, though far inferior in size and di-
mentions, at Abernethy, formerly the seat of the Pictish
kingdom.  It is certain that Brechin, a City of great antiqui-
ty, was a part of that kingdom.  When the church of Bre-
chin was burnt down by the Danes in the reign of Malcolm
II.  in the manner already mentioned, this famous steeple was
standing, and escaped the general constagration.  It is highly
probable, that the church which was then burnt, and the
steeple to which it adjoined, as the church does at present,
were both of them built during the continuance of the Pic-

   It has been alledged that towers or steeples of this kind
could not be intended for belfries, because they are placed
near to churches, the steeples of which are provided with bells
of their own.  Those who make this objection should advert,
that the fine sound of bells arises in great measure from their
being rung together, or in concert.  The large bell in the
steeple of the church of Brechin is remarkably fine.  It had

of this kind in the easternmost part of the country parish,
which having been dedicated to Saint Magdalene, still retains
the name of Magdalene Chapel.  Here is a burial ground,
which is still used for this purpose by several of the par-
