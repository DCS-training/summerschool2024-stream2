	IV.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY-ECCLESIASTICAL STATE.
   The ancient parish in which Leith is now comprehended was
Restalrig or Lestalric. The parish constituted a barony; and
at the earliest period in which it is mentioned, it belonged to the
family De Lestalric. The parsonage existed at least as far back
as the demise of Alexander III. In 1291, Adam of St Ed-
monds was parson of Restalrig; and be had a writ to the sheriff
of Edinburgh to deliver him his lands and rights. Whether from
the beauty of the situation, or from its near vicinity to the Abbey
of the Holy Rood, the ancient residence of the Scottish Kings,
James III. founded there one of those colleges or fraternities of
secular clergy, of which there were many throughout Scotland.
and several in the neighbourhood, as at Corstorpbine, Roslin, and
Crichton, and Trinity College, Edinburgh. This establishment
was dedicated to the Holy Trinity and the Virgin, and united with
the parish church. It included, besides the church, a "lodging"
for the dean, and "chambers" or "manses," with "yardis and

by the founder's royal successors, James IV. and James V. till it
came to consist at last of a dean, eight prebendaries and two sing
ing boys. In the year 1661, according to the rentals given in to
government, "the fruites of the Denerie of Restalrig, as it payis
presentlie and comounlie thir divers yeirs bygane, with the paro-
chins of Leswaid and Glencorss," were twenty-five chalders eight,
bolls two firlots oats; eight chalders six bolls two firlots bear; two
chalders thirteen bolls one firlot wheat; one chalder three bolls
two firlois rye; with L. 43, 6s. 8d. Scots money.
   The grebe and manse of said parsonage was given in feu for the
yearly payment of L. 47, 6s. 8d. Scots.
   In 1435, the lands of Restalrig and patronage of the parsonage
was confirmed to Thomas Logan. From this family the grant
