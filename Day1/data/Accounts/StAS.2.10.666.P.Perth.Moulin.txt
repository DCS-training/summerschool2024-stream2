     In the collections of 1837, there is included L. 6, 12s. 91/2d.,
and in 1898, L.4,Os.3d. received as our proportion of the collec-
tions made in the church of Tenandry.
     It is still considered as degrading to receive aid from the poor's
fundr, but necessity has of late weakened that noble spirit of inde-
pendece, with which our people used to veiw any connexion with
the poor's revenues.  Spinning, the occupation by which females
were wont to live, has of late years completely failded, and there
being no other suitable employment for them in the country, they
are obliged in consequence to appley for parochial relief.
     Mendicity.--Really some measuire should be adopted to sup-
press the system of mendicity, which has lately prevailed to such
an annoying extent in the district.  To use a homely phrase, we
are perfectly ate up with beggars.  To supply from 8 to 12 a day
is no uncommon call on our benevolence.  This, surely, is a posi-
tive evil,-- but an evil which, though we deprecate the system, is
still encouraged, from a principle of false humanity.  NOr is this
the only ground fo complaint; mendicity often brings other evils
in its train.  Issuing from the unhealthy and thickly-peopled lanes
and clossed of our large manugfacturing towns in the south, these
mendicants, ill-fed and ill-clad,--being themselves the easy victims
of infection,--carry all manner of contagion with them, either in
their person or in thdhr clothes.  The consequence has too often
been, that they leave, as a legacy behind them, the most loathsome
deseases.  Scarlet fever, hooping-cough, and small-pox are generally
traced to them.  Have we not, then, good reason to complain when
our charity is thus frequently rewarded?  If, however, the slatute,
making every parish suport its own poor, were in full forsce, then
the sums expended in charity would be more profitably applied,
the interests of morality and religion would be better secured, and
the poor themselved would be far more adequately relived.


<FOOTNOTE>It appears from our kirk session records, that the annual collections in this pa-
rish, including fines, &c. were a century ago as follows ; in 1736, L. 5, 6s. 4d ; in 1737,
L. 6, 16s. 8ed.; in 1788, L. 5, 16s. 8d.  In 1735, a collections was made for educating for
the ministry young men who knew the Gaelic language, which amounted to L.4
Scott, and in 1761 for distressed minister and congregations in America, amounting
to L.9, 8s. 6d. Scots money.  Comparing the amount of these collections with that of
those recently made, the advancement which, in the last century, this parish has
made in industry and properity, clearly appears.
