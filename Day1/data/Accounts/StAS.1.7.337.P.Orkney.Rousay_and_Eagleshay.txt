is, in this island of Rousay, 772, the youngest child being

   Eglishay.-Eglishay is a pleasant, low lying island, with a
small Gothic church in the west part of the island, which
has been dedicated to St Magnus, the tutelar saint of all
Orkney.  It has a pyramidical steeple at the west end, and
a vaulted quire at the east end, which joins to the body of
the church.  In Eglishay there is a small lake of fresh water;
and the soil is very good, and fit for culture; but it is poorly
cultivated.  There is a small bay of shell land, of the best
kind, on the west side of this island, and a large track of
sand on the north side, with much bent, and many rabbits.
Sponge is cast on shore in October, in great abundance, about
this island.  The number of inhabitants in this island of
Eglishay is 210, the youngest child being included.

   Weir Island.-Weir Island is a small low lying island, not
so large as is Eglishay.  The soil is the same, and the culture
very poor, and the crops unequal to what might be expected
from proper management.  There is a ruinous church here,
and a quire, but no steeple; and there is the vestiges of a for-
tification on a rising ground, a little from the place where
the church stands.  There is moss ground in a part of this
island; and many seals are to be seen on the rocks at the
west end of this island.  The number of the inhabitants is 65,
the youngest child included.

   Inhallow Island.-Inhallow Island is very small, but very
pleasantly situated, being overlooked by the hills and head-

number of inhabitants is 25, the youngest child being in-
