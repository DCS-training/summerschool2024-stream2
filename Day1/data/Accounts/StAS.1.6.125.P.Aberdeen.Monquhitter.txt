   The rage of emigration never agitates the bosoms of the
people, and every hovel boasts a suitable inhabitant.-
Strangers, upon settling here, find themselves much at home,
and those who have been born in the parish are fondly attached
to their native soil. "How can I live," said a poor fellow,
not destitute of genius, who had wandered to Edinburgh in
search of business, "oh!  how can I live, out of the sight of
"the bonny parks of Auchry?" To the bonny parks of
Auchry his predominant passion obliged him to return, and he
is now active in encreasing the population by a numerous fa-
mily.

   Appearance and Character of the People, etc.-The people
are generally middle sized, raw boned, sinewy, and not a lit-
tle distinguished by the characteristic feature of Scotland.  Few
exceed 6 feet in height, almost none are below 5 feet 5 inches.
The men, for the most part acute, sagacious, sober, indus-
trious, are now educated in a style superior to their station.
Very few chuse the sea-faring or military line; but those who
do, are esteemed for steadiness and bravery.  The women are
well shaped, active, and trained to manufacture from child-
hood.  The Norman blood still slames on the heads of some;
not a few are adorned by fair and yellow locks; but, in general,
the animated countenance is shaded by black or by dusky hair.
   Although no capital branch of manufacture is established in
the parish, yet manufacture is greatly advanced by the labours
of the people.  Linen yarn is spun for the merchant almost in
every family.  Some thousand pairs of cargo hose, at is per
pair, are annually sent to market.  Fine wool, given out by
the manufacturers of Aberdeen, is spun and knit into stock-
ings.  A few make woolen and linen cloth for sale: and a nu-
merous class of weavers are well employed.
   A very great change, as to diet and dress, has taken place
