engross all their attention; and, the people being poor, and
not enjoying the benefit of long leases, until these obstacles
are remove, it is not to be imagined, that ever any remark-
able exertions will take place among them, in cultivating the
ground.
   No vestiges of any antiquities, excepting a few Pictish or
Danish forts, etc. which merit no particular description, are
to be found here.  It is most likely, that the Romans were
utterly unacquainted with the Shetland Isles.  The Island of
Fula was probably descried by them, from the Orkneys, in
their circumnavigation of Britain, its name being so familiar
to that of Thule, mentioned by Tacitus.

   General Character.-The People, in general, are sober and
unoffensive.  Crimes of an atrocious nature are little known
amongst them.  They are judicious, of a ready and acute un-
derstanding, capable of enduring great toil, cold, and hunger,
supra quam cuique credible est; run prodigious risks, in going
out 10 or 11 leagues into the ocean, on the ling and tusk fish-
ing, in small fix-oar'd boats, which, together with all their fish-
ing materials, they provide at their own expence.  They prove
excellent seamen, when they go abroad; are much esteemed
in the British navy; and, considred in this point of view,
well merit the attention and favour of government.  This
observation, indeed, may be applied, with equal justice, to
Shetland in general.  In religious matters, they enjoy a hap-
py moderation and uniformity of sentiment; their faith not
being distracted by controversy, nor sectarism infesting their
abodes.
