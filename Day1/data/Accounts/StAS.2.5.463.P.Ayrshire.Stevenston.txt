number in so small a parish; and it tells us that the sand-hills will
not be subdued for more than a century to come, unless prompter
measures are adopted.
   The number of Scotch acres in the parish is 3181. The ren-
tal of the parish, as nearly as we can ascertain it, (and the greater
part of our information has been furnished by the proprietors,) is
L.3836. Some of the land lets remarkably high. Fields of a
few acres near Stevenston were this season, for one crop, let at
L.14, and even L. 14, 14s. per acre. They would not let
so high, however, on lease, and allowance is made for that in mak-
ing up the rental. Deducting the 1200 barren acres and their
rent, and deducting about 154 acres in gardens, and plantations,
and roads, the rest of the parish lets on an average at L. 2 per
acre. The rental in 1791 was L. 1170; and the average rent
13s. per acre.
   Raw Produce.--The farmers and others have kindly given us

ment of the yearly amount of raw produce of the parish.

   There are many other articles of raw produce, the value of
which we have not been able to discover.
   The number of farms in the parish is about 23. They are
not of great size, being from twenty to rather upwards of a hun-
dred acres. The more general size is from sixty to eighty acres.
The rents, in proportion to the farms, vary from L.40 to rather
above L.200. The farmers are steady and industrious, but mak-
ing, we believe, at present very small profits. The farm-houses
are in general good. Hawthorn hedges, in almost all cases, form
the enclosures. Stone-dikes give a hard and barren aspect to the
