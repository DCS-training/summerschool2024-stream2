hearing of the unexpected success of Robert Bruce, returned to
claim his right, and to support that of his country. The king,
however, on his remonstrance, finding the possessors in nowise wil-
ling to relinquish so valuable a property, granted to him an equi-
valent of lands in the north." These noble families have now no
interest in Tweeddale.*
  There can be no doubt that the glens and mountains of this pa-
rish were among the favourite haunts of our persecuted forefathers
in the reign of Charles II. Donald's Cleugh, in Games-hope, is
generally understood to have been so named from its being the re-
treat of that sturdy adherent of the Covenant, Donald Cargill, after
he had fled from his charge in the Barony church of Glasgow, in
consequence of the violent persecution directed against the cove-
nanters of the west.+

<FOOTNOTE>*Buchanan of Auchmar, in his inquiry into the genealogy of ancient Scots sir-
names, says, "That great man Sir Simon Frazer, so famous in the reign of Robert
I., was Lord of Tweeddale, and resided at Oliver Castle in that county;" and adds,
that "the Tweedies, now possessors of that castle and adjacent estate, are supposed
to be descended from the ancient Frazers, now of Lovat and Saltoun." How the
Tweedies became proprietors of Oliver Castle is variously conjectured, but it is un-
doubted that they resided at Drummelzier in James First's time, and were possessors
of almost the whole lands from Neidpath Xastle, near Peebles, the ancient property
and chief residence of the Frasers of Oilver Castles, in this parish. It is thought that
Drummelzier was alienated from them about the latter end of James Fifth's time.
The site of the old castle of Oliver is still pointed out at a clump of trees on high
ground opposite the manse, but on the other side of the river; and contiguous to it
is the present mansion-house, a plain substantial edifice, the occasional residence of
Lawrence Tweedie, Esq. now Laird of Oliver. As to the origin of the Tweedies,
see Waverley Novels, Introduction to the Betrothed, pp.6-8.
