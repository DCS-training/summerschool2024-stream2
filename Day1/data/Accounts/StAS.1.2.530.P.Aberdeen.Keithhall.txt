     Statistical Account

into new leases, and moss having become very scarce, the
tenants were restricted to a certain number of subtenants;
so that, in winter 1784, the minister's parish list was reduced
to exactly 797 persons.  In 1790 it rose to 816; and at Whit-
Sunday 1791, to 838.  Of last this number, 232 were below 15;
76 between 15 and 20; 134 between 20 and 30; 129 from 
30 to 40; 88 from 40 to 50; 75 from 50 to 60; 52 from
60 to 70; 36 from 70 to 80; 13 from 80 to 90; and 3 from
90 to 100.  Among these, there are only two residing heritors,
the Earl of Kintore, and Major General Gordon, of Balbi-
than.  31 farmers pay L. 10, or more of rent; 113 are small
farmers, or subtenants, and 64 have only a house, and some-
times a small garden, subsisting chiefly by knitting stockings.
Of the small farmers and subtenants, 4 are blacksmiths, 6
house carpenters, or cart-wrights, 3 taylors, 5 shoemakers,
and 2 weavers.-There are only 3 non-residing proprie-
tors.

   Proportion of the Sexes.-The number of the males and fe-
males is exactly equal.  Before the Earl of Kintore came to re-
side in these parishes, there were generally 6 or 8 more males
than females.  (The number of maid-servants in great houses,
exceeds, for the most part, that of men-servants.  In farm-
houses the reverse holds true).  By inspecting the register of
baptisms it appears, that out of 2025 births, 1025 were males,
and 1000 were females.  Consequently the proportion of
males to females, is exactly as 41 to 40; only more males re-
move to Aberdeen, or go abroad, which renders the numbers
at home so equal.

   State of the Poor.-The number of families on the poors
roll has varied from 18, its present number, to 30, besides
