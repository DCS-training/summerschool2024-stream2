   There are at present more instances of longevity here
(as is always the case) than in any other parish in the
island; severals near 90, and some above that age, are at pre-
sent alive.  They marry very young, and barrenness is
scarcely known.  All the people dwell in little farm-villa-
ges, and they fish in the summer-season.  The women do not
fish; but almost at all times, when there is occasion to go
to sea, they never decline that service, and row powerfully.
When they go to the hills with their cattle, all descriptions
of sex and age angle on the fresh-water lakes.  All the
woollen and linen cloth used for common purposes is spun
and wove in the parish.  There is only one surgeon in the
whole island.  All the inhabitants are of the Established
Church.  In the parish are four or five boat-carpenters.
