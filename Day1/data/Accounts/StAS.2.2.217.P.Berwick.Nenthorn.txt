Family Seats.-In the south-east angle of the parish is situated
the fine mansion of Newton Don, and the extensive and richly or-
namented policy connected with it, commanding one of the loveliest
prospects on the Tweed,-near to which, the Eden is suddenly
precipitated over a ledge of rock, from thirty to forty feet perpen-
dicular. Here are preserved some ancient relies of the Earls of
Glencairn, noticed in the early history of the church, of which
noble house Sir William Don is now the representative. The
only other mansion in the parish is that of Mr Roy, formerly the
residence of the Kerrs of Littledean, a branch of the family of
Roxburghe.
   Parochial Registers.-The register of proclamations of marriage
begins in 1702, and of baptisms in 1715. The deaths of every
tenth year are marked from 1740 to 1780, and after that regular-
ly every year till 1800.

                    <TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>
   From the register of baptisms, the population in 1720 and,1730
appears to have been at least double its present amount, the bap-
tisms of these two years being equal in number to those of the
seven years ending with 1&33. The population was
       In 1755, according to Dr Webster,            497
            1790, ascertained to be        -        376
            1801, by the Government Census,         395
            1811,                                   398
            1821,                                   393
            1831,                                   380

The causes of the decline of the population since the middle of
last century have been,-the decay and ultimate extinction of the
villages at Nenthorn and Newton, as also the junction of small
farms, and more lately, emigration to Canada.

   Character and Habits of the People.-There being no village
now, with the exception of a few cottages on Mr Bailhe's proper-
ty, the population is almost wholly agricultural, and partakes of
the general habits of that class; but the local attachments are not
strong. Not a single farmer in the parish is a native of it. The
