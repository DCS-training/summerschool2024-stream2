     NUMBER XII.

     PARISH OF NEWABBEY.

     (STEWARTRY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT.)

     By the Rev. MR. WILLIAM WRIGHT.

     Name.

   THE antient name of the parish was Kirkinnar, or Kirkin-
dar, the former a corruption of the latter, which sig-
nifies in the Celtic, the church among the oaks.  The present
name is assumed from a famous abbey in the parish, which
will hereafter be particularly mentioned.

   Situation, Extent, and Surface.-This parish, lying in the
stewartry of Kirkcudbright, within the bounds of the presby-
tery and synod of Dumfries, is about 8 miles long, and 2 1/2
broad, containing about 7810 Scots acres, whereof 2000 are
arable, 500 meadow-merse and low pasture, 250 in planta-
tions, 60 in natural wood, such as oak, ash, birch, &c. and
the remaining 5000 acres, are hill, and muir, and moss.  The
face of general appearance of the parish is very different, the
lower part, lying along the river Nith, being regularly inclos-
ed and highly improved, commanding a noble prospect of
the Solway-Firth, and coast of England; while the upper
division consists of rocky hills, mosses, and muirs.
