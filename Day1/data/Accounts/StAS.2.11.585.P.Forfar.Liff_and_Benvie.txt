of the country by the name of the Benvie Pear, is a native of this
spot. A very ancient tree of this sort, (probably the original),
after being laid prostrate for many years, and still continuing to
bear, was lately removed.
        Quarries.-Quarries of excellent freestone abound in this parish.
At Lochee are several, which have been wrought for a long period.
From one of these, the materials for that magnificent work, the
Dundee Harbour, were, for several years, chiefly obtained. Lat-
terly, the trustees have had recourse to a quarry at Pyot Dikes,
five miles from Dundee, where blocks of hard stone, of almost
any size, may be had.

        Manufactures.-The chief, almost the sole, branch of manu-
facture carried on in this parish, is the weaving of coarse linen
cloth, principally for exportation. This has almost entirely su-
perseded the weaving of household linen, as hand-spinning has
been almost wholly given up since the introduction of machinery,
by means of which, this part of the work is performed with great
accuracy. Young persons, of both sexes, are early trained to the
loom; but many of them have recourse to out-door-work, and find
employment in agricultural operations, during spring and harvest,
and many labourers `pply themselves to the loom during winter.
	Estimating the population of that part of the village of Lochee,
connected with this parish, at 3000, it cannot be far from the
truth, to consider two-thirds of that number, both male and fe-
