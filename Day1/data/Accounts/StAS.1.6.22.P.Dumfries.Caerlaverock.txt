which, even after it has been limed and tilled, but ill rewards
the labour of the husbandman.  The low and level point is of
various soils.  The whole stands on a red freestone bottom,
which, in the higher land, is at no great depth from the sur-
face; and is a soft, easily wrought, though pretty durable,
stone, used for building in the vicinity.  Some of it has of
late been manufactured into flags, and exported to Dublin
and liverpool.-In the Nith, excellent slounders and sal-
mon are caught* by the farmers and cotters; and either con-
sumed in their families, or carried to Dumfries.  In the
Lochar, are found pikes, roaches, and eels, in abundance,
likewise a few trouts: and, near its mouth, salmon and sloun-
ders are sometimes, but rarely, caught.-In the parish are
two harbours, Keltown and Glencaple.  At the former, the
tide rises 15 feet; and at the latter, 12 feet, at the full and
change of the moon.  The vessels belonging to Nith, are from
30 to 80 or 90 tons burden; chiefly employed in bringing
lime and coals from Cumberland; and from Liverpool, such
grocery goods as are consumed in the neighbourhood; and
in exporting potatoes and grain.  Of late, rum, fruit, and
Port wine, have been imported; and a considerable quantity
of timber is annually brought from Memel and Riga: but 
the vessels employed in these voyages are generally obliged to 
unload at the Carse, 6 miles below Glencaple Key.

and nowhere more than two miles broad, containing about 4640 
Scotch acres; whereof, 59 are wood, about 60 moss, and 
the rest arable, with the exception of nearly 40 acres of mea-
dow liable to be overflowed by Lochar; and a still greater ex-
