bourhood is willing to take the young man who is school-
master into his family; and to afford him bed, board, and
washing for such attendance as he can bestow upon his

   Where the number of scholars is so few, and the wages of
teaching are so low, there might be ground to apprehend, if the
salary is very much augmented, that all the difference of emolu-
