   Antiquities.-On a hill called the Schurroch, to the west-
ward of the church, there are in three different places, e-
qually distant from each other, several large stones, erected
in a circular form, called here Druds altars, which is evi-
dently a corruption of Druids altars, and shows them to
have been places of Pagan worship.  Upon the top of ano-
ther hill, called Catlaw, already mentioned, which bounds
this parish on the north, there is a very large cairn of
stones, in a circular form also; but whether used as a place
of worship, or of observation, from whence signals were
given to the country, on the approach of an enemy, is un-
certain.  The castle of Balfour, formerly the principal re-
sidence of Ogilvy of Balfour, an ancient family, and a de-
scendent of the family of Airly, has some claim to anti-
quity.  As there is no date to be seen upon any part of
the walls, which are still standing, it is not generally known
in what year it was built.  The structure is evidently in
the Gothic style; and, from facts connected with it, about
which there is no uncertainty, must be upwards of 200
years old, and might probably have been erected about the
middle of the 16th century.  The family of Balfour is
sunk into the family of Fotheringham, and Colonel Fothe-
ringham of Pourie, by the female line, is proprietor of the
estate of Balfour, the most extensive, and the bell land of
any in the parish.

   Population, etc.-According to Dr Webster's report, the
number of souls was then 780.  The population is dimi-
nishing.  The present number is about 600 Of whom are
18 or 20, who are Episcopalians; and 2 men and 1 wo-
man, who are Seceders.  The number of families is 129.
