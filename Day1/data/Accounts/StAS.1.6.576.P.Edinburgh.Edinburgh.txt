   A sunday school was established in the parish three years a-
go, where 100 children attend, and it is of the greatest bene-
fit to the place; young people, who formerly were brought up
in the profoundest ignorance, and grosly mispent the sabbath
day, are now taught a reverence for it, and are educated in the
principles of religion and morals. The master is allowed five
guineas a year, by the Society for promoting Religious Know-
ledge among the Poor.

   It might have been necessary to have enlarged this part of
the work considerably, and for that purpose to have made more
extensive inquiries into the statistical circumstances of Edin-
burgh and its neighbourhood, had not William Creech, Esq.
a respectable magistrate of that city, paid particular attention to
such inquiries, which led him, some years ago, to draw up a
comparative view of Edinburgh in 1763 and 1783; contain-
ing many curious particulars, not only relative to that city, but
to Scotland in general, with many important observations in
regard to the changes which had taken place in that period in
the mode of living, arts, commerce, literature, manners, & c.
of the inhabitants. As Mr Creech very readily agreed to car-
ry down that information to the present period, it precludes
the necessity of any farther investigation of that nature. The
reader is therefore referred to the following appendix for the
statistical progress, and present state of Edinburgh, and also for
an interesting papers respecting such extraordinary physical
phenomena as have occurred in Scotland, for some years past.
