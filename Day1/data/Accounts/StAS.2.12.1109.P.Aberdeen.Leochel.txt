craigie, and pendicles to Duguid of Auchinhive, sold the remain-
der in 1670, to Sir John Forbes, Bart. of Craigievar, to which pro-
perty it is still united.*
    Craigievar.-This property belonged for upwards of 200 years
to a family of the name of Mortimer. In 1457, Edmund Morti-
mer had from James II., on his own resignation, a charter of the
lands of "Craigievar, Ballindene, Innyteire, and Wester Loch-
ale;" in 1503, Alexander Mortimer resigned these lands in his
own favour, into the hands of James IV.; in 1600, Alexander
Mortimer, eldest son of James Mortimer, fiar of Craigievar, had
a charter of confirmation of these lands from James VI.; and in
1610, John Mortimer, fiar of Craigievar, sold the property to
William Forbes of Menie. He was the second son of William
Forbes of Corse, already mentioned, was educated in Edinburgh,
and having acquired a large fortune by commerce, he had char-
ters of the lands of Menie in Aberdeenshire, in 1607, of Craigie-
var in 1610; of the barony of Auchtertoul in Fife, in 1617; of
the barony of Finhaven and Carreston in Forfar, in 1619; and of
the lands of Fintray in Aberdeenshire, the same year. He has
been commemorated by the celebrated Arthur Johnstone in an
epitaph, who says of him,
              Quas possedit opes, et terrae jugera, nemo
              Miretur, dominum plus fuit, esse sui.+
He was succeeded by his son William, who, in 1630, was created
a baronet of Nova Scotia, and having embraced the side of the
Covenanters, took an active part in the troubles which followed.
He was appointed one of the committee for stating the national
debt, one of the commission for planting of kirks and valuation of
teinds in 1641, one of the commissioners for conserving the Rip-
pon treaty in 1644, one of the committee of estates in 1645, one
of the commissioners for selling the estates of mallignants in
