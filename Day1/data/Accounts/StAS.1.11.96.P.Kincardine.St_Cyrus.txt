boldly project, so as to form a very picturesque and interesting
view, which cannot fail to delight the eye of the traveller, and
fix him a while on the spot.  About 500 yards below the bridge,
there is a fine cascade, which is not perceived till you come
close upon it.  This body of water falls from a height of about
63 feet perpendicular; and when the rivulet is swelled into a
river, or increased by rain beyond its usual channes, the be-
holder is struck with astonishment at the grandeur of the
of the scene.  The water, before it precipitates, holds its
course 45 feet below the surface of the adjoining fields.  The
burn of Woodston, which forms also a small den near its
mouth, falls in a broken hypothenusal line, of about 75 feet,
into the German ocean.  Though this fall, deserves a place
among the natural beauties of the parish, and is one of the
finest objects that meets the eye of the traveller east from
Montrose, yet that of Den Fenel far surpasses it in awful
grandeur, and striking sublimity.  The rivulets, in some of
these dens, have contributed as much to profit as to pleasure,
by supplying water to some of the corn mills of the parish.
The dens themselves afford, in general, excellent and well
sheltered pasture.

   Roads, etc.-Yet, after all the pleasure and the profits
arising from these dens, they have their inconveniences: They
render the formation of high roads a work of great difficulty
and expence.  So late even as 35 years ago, to travel from
Montrose to Bervie, (which is only 13 miles), in a carriage,
was a dangerous journey.  There was a rough, and often an
unsafe ford, to pass through the North Esk; then a steep wa-
ter-worn path to climb up to the common level of St. Cyrus
parish; and then 3 dens to pass, without bridges, by narrow
and winding paths down their steep sides, without one foot of
made road all the way.  Now, indeed, these inconveniences
