&e.The society's funds are represented as in a flourishing state,
andanswering the end of the institution.
There is also distinct from this, the Brotherly Society,'insti-
tuted July 182 1.
Savings Bank.-There are two savings banks, one of a good
many years standing; the other instituted December 1835. With
regard to it, I have been informed that its deposits (in the National
Bank, Anstruther,) amount to about L. 2 per week. There is also
a female savings bank, reported to be doino, well. The invest-
rnents in these banks are by the fishing and labotiring classes.
Poor and Parochial Funds.- The heritors and session have a re-
gular meeting every half year about the middle of June and the
middle of December, when they audit the treasurer's accounts, ad-
just the pooes roll for the ensuing half vear, and come to a deci-
sion upon matters of parochial business.
Our average, taken half yearly, from 1st January 1835, to 31st
December 1836, gives us of pensioners 19, at 3s. 2d. nearly per
month.
The session's yearly income from all sources, from Ist October
1835, to 30th September 1836, amounts to L. 39, Is. 91 d.

supplied by the heritors in voluntary assessment, L. 52, 3s. 2 1/2d.
Prisons.-There are two prisons in St Monan's, under one roof,
one on the upper floor of the town-house, the other on the ground
floor. They are equally well secured; the lower, by much the
more dismal of the two. Prisoners are committed to the one or the
other according to their pre-eminence in delinquency. The ma-
gistrates imprison as sudden emergency calls for it; but they do
not impose fines, except with the formalities of a regularly con-
stituted courl So far as I have occasion to bear, imprisonment
is a rare occurrence.

Inn, &c.-As this place is no thoroughfare, there can hardly be
