before the middle of March, and bear about the middle of
April.  In the 1782, 1785, 1788, and 1789, April
was begun, and the first eight days of it near gone, before
there was any sowing here.  But in 1787, 1790, and 1791,
some of our farmers began to sow pease and oats in Februa-
ry, and all of them in the first and second week of March.
   The beginning of harvest here is also various.  Generally
it begins about the first or second week of September, and
is finished before the first of November, and all the corns
go in.  But in the year 1782, there was no reaping till
the 3 d of October, and it was the 20th of November before
all the corns were got in.  Crop 1782 in this place, as in
the greatest part of the kingdom, turned out very unpro-
ductive.  The snow and frost came on before the corns
were ripened.  However, with what the people had refer-
ved of the former crop, and with the scanty supply which
crop 1782 assorted, they were able to subsist till crop 1783
came in aid, without seeking any assistance from abroad; or
at least, if a small portion of meal was brought from Mon-
trose, and some bolls of feed-oats bought, there was more
fold out of the parishes, to people who came from Dee side,
and other places.  It is the practice of many in these parishes
to have their girnals or meal-chests always pretty full, that
they may be prepared against a bad crop.  Experience has
taught them this precaution, because the harvests here are
often precarious, and the corns suffer either by wind, or by
the winter coming on before they are fully ripened.  There
is but little flax raised here.  It does not generally ripen suf-
ficiently, to tempt a farmer to risk many acres on its culti-
vation.  Yet most of the farmers in the lower part of the
parishes sow a peck or two for the use of their own families,
and they reckon it a tolerable crop, if they have between
two and three stone after the peck of lintseed.  The stone
