report, the number is 1907.  This increase is the more re-
markable, as it has taken place, notwithstanding emigra-
tions at different times to foreign parts.  If there had been
no emigrations, the number of people would have been con-
siderably greater.  From 1771 to 1774, 128 souls emigrated.
In August 1788, about 200 souls went from this parish to
North America, and about the same number in October
1790.  The number of  males will be upwards of a third
more than that of the females.  There are no towns nor vil-
lages in the parish.  The annual average of births is 40, of
deaths 16, of marriages 20. All the inhabitants are of the
established church, except two Episcopalians; there are no
Seceders, and no Roman Catholics.

   Productions.-This parish produces black cattle, sheep,
and horses.  Black cattle is the main staple, of which 
the numbers are sent to the Englsh markets every year; from
the returns of which the people pay their rents, and supply
themselves with necessaries.  There are small quantities of
sheep on each farm, but there is no farm laid out entirely
in the sheep pasture.  The breed of horses is generally so small,
that each farm must keep a number of them for leading
their peats, (which is their chief fuel), for leading manure,
and for labouring the ground.  The parish does not al-
ways supply itself with provisions, but frequently imports
grain from other countries.  There is neither hemp, nor flax,
raised here, but there are much greater quantities of hay
than there was 20, 30, or 40 years ago; all from natural
grass.  The people in general cultivate small oats, which
they  sow in the months of March and April, and reap in
the months of September and October.  Their barley and
potatoes they sow in the month of April, and reap in the
months of August and September.
