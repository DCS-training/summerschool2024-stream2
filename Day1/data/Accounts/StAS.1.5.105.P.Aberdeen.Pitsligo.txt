Might it not be proper for the heritors of the parish, who
are all very respectable gentlemen, and distinguished for at-
tention to the interests of their country, to attempt the esta-
blishment of some suitable manufactures in it?  In a place
where living is cheaper than in large towns, they certainly
might be expected to succeed, with very little encourage-
ment.
   The last improvement, which the parish stands much in
need of, is the making of a harbour at Rosehearty.  There is
already a quay, or one side of a harbour at that place,
where sloops lie between April and September.  But even
then, so changeable is the weather, that they are in danger of
sustaining great damage.  This brings an additional expence
upon trade, as goods must be brought from Frasersburgh,
the nearest port, by land carriage.  Lord Gardenston has
generously ordered a considerable sum of money to be laid
out in the improvement of this  harbour, and measures will
soon be taken for carrying that public spirited intention in-
to effect.  This is a necessary and important alteration; and
it is hoped it will be the means of introducing other essen-
tial improvements.
