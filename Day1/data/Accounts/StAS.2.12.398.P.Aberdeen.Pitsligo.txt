by his neighbours as a very prudent man, his example drew many
into the same course.  He was attainted by the title of Lord Pit-
sligo, and his honours and estate were forfeited.  He claimed his
estate before the Court of Session on account of the misnomer,
his true title being Lord Forbes of Pitsligo, and that court gave
judgment in his favour, 16th November 1749.  But on an appeal
it was reversed by the House of Lords, on 1st February 1750.
He died at Auchiries, in Aberdeenshire, on 21st December 1762.
   Land-owners.-The only heritors are, Sir John Stuart Forbes,
Bart.; John Duff Dingwall, Esq. of Brucklaw and Corsindae;
and Lord Saltoun.
   Parochial Registers.-The earliest date of the parochial register
is 1676 : it contains an account of session matters only.  From
1720 the entries are more regular.  No register of deaths was ever
kept, and that of births is very irregularly kept.
   Antiquities.-The only ruins of any note in this parish are the
Castles of Pitsligo and Pittulie, both situated on the property of
Sir John S. Forbes, and overlooking the sea.  The former had
evidently been a strongly built castle, the walls being from six to
seven feet thick, and probably reared nearly three centuries ago.
The ground around is planted with young wood, and the garden
still yields some of the finest fruit to be found in the county.  The
latter castle, it is supposed, must have been built by the Saltoun
family, as their coat of arms, carved in stone, is still legible on the
original part of the building: it was, however, afterwards enlarged
by the Cummings, in whose possession the property long was.

   The ancient state ofthe population cannot be accurately traced.

   The increase may be ascribed, in a great measure, to the more
extensive prosecution of the fishing trade, especially the herring-
fishing, which, until thirty years ago, had never been attempted on
this coast.  In the landward part of the parish, the population for
some time back has rather decreased, in consequence of many
