widows of decayed tradesmen.  There have been instances of
this, however, though they are never admitted on the pen-
sion list.  This had been a much better charity; but was un-
happily overlooked by the founder.  A poor widow, stripped
of charitable supply, at the same time that the loses her hus-
band, must be poor indeed.
   COWAN'S HOSPITAL comes next in order.  It was sounded
and endowed by John Cowan, merchant in Stirling, anno
1639, for the support of 12 decayed guild brethren.  The
original mortification was 2222 L. Sterling.  There was a neat
genteel house erected by the patrons, after Cowan's death,

are above an hundred pensioners on this charity.  They re-
