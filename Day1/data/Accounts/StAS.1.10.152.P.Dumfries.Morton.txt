raised for a considerable number of years; and, at granting
new leases, large grassums have been received.  If the farms
were let without grassums, at the rate usually paid for similar
lands in this part of the country, it is supposed the rental of
this parish would be about 1500 L.  All the Duke of Queens-
berry's property here is under strict entail, and leases can be
granted for no more than 19 years.

   Agriculture.-Till within there 20 years, little progress had
been made in the cultivation of land in this parish, or coun-
try adjoining.  Indeed, previous to that period, the means
of cultivation were little known, or were not to be had.  In
this neighbourhood, no marl of any consequence has ever
been discovered, and very little lime was then used.  The
only manure, therefore, which the farmers had for their
lands, was the dung produced by their cattle.  This they
very injudiciously confined to a small part of their farm,
generally near the houses, called croft land, which, being thus
enriched, and almost incessantly cropped with oats or bear,
became so full of weeds, as to yield very bad returns.  The
principal part of the farms, though very improveable, was
left entirely in a state of nature, covered with coarse grass or
short heath, and grazed by a small breed of black cattle and
sheep.

   The mode of husbandry is now totally changed, and vastly
improved.  About 20 years ago, Sir James Kirkpatrick be-
gan to carry on with spirit his limeworks in the neighbour-
ing parish of Closeburn; and, upon an extensive scale, set an
example to the whole surrounding country, of the beneficial
effects of that manure when properly applied to land.  His
example was soon followed by others, and has been the
means of bringing about an amazing improvement both in
the produce and in the appearance of this country.  The
