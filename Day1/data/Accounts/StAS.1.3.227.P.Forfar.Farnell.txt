   The number of the principal farmers is 11 or 12, most
of whom are married and have families.  Several of them pay
L. 100, some from L. 100 to L. 150 of rent; and one pays
L. 250.  There are several other small farms, which let at
different prices; as, 5, 8, 10, 20, or L. 30.  There are only
three or four families of dissenters; of whom one or two are
Episcopalians, and the rest Non-jurors.  There are no Sece-
ders, nor Roman Catholics.

parish, of which 8 or 900 acres are of a rich clay soil.  The
greater part of the parish is enclosed; the haughs or low

the others with sences of earth and whins, or with stone
dykes; which last is acknowledged to be the best of any.
Several improvements in this way have been carries on

tenants paying the interest.  The farm houses are in general

and covered with state.  The principal crops in the parish
are wheat, oats, barley, and pease.  The quantity of wheat
sown here, has, for some time, greatly increased, and
the clay soil is peculiarly adapted for it.  This year there
are about 150 acres of wheat sown.  Of late, there has been
almost no Chester bear sown, barley being preferred, on ac-
count of its giving a greater return, and a higher price.  A
considerable quantity of pease, some beans, and a great deal
of clover and rye-grass, are sown in the parish; and usually
about 30 acres of stax.  Turnips and potatoes are a general
crop all over the country.  Yams are also succesfully culti-
