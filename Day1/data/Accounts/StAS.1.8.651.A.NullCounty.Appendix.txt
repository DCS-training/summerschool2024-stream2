   The minister of this parish, in a letter sent since the account
of it was printed, says, that the article of cheese was consider-
ably under-rated; that the average produce from each cow
is 4 L. Sterling, and the total amount per annum 4000 L. Sterling.
He farther adds, that there are three bleachfields in the parish,
in one of which a good deal of business is done; that, in the
table of artificers, etc. 4 stocking makers, and 6 coal-hewers,
are omitted; and that, to the article of minerals, may be add-
