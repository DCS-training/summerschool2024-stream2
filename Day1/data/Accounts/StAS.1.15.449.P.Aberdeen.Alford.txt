     of Alford.

inferior firearms, Alford is watered by the Don, a river of
some size, which, gushing through a narrow gullet, between
the mountains on the West, winds its course in a direction
from West to East, through the whole length of the coun-
try, and, after adorning several gentlemen's seats on its
banks, flows away through a narrow valley, encompassed
on the North, by Bennachie, which rises up into high and
magnificent Alpine tops.

   The parish of Alford is in length, from South-West to
North-East, from 7 to 8 English miles; and from 3 to be-
tween 4 and 5 in breadth.  It contains nearly 8000 Scotch a-
cres; of which there may be 3600 arable, 3700 of hill, muir,
moss, and pasture grounds, and about 700 of woods.  These
last consist of planted Scotch firs, intermixed with larixes,
beeches, oaks, aihes, birks, and other trees of different ages,
besides a good deal of grown timber about gentlemen's seats,
and the tenant's yards.

   Soil.-The soil on the banks of the Don, is generally a good
light loam, very fit for corn crops, but better adapted for
grass, because of the mildews arising from the river, which
are hurtful to grain, especially to barley.  In the Eastern
parts of the parish, the soil is in some places a good deep
loam, in others, a strong, but workable clay, and sometimes
a mixture of both.  In this quarter, and the adjoining parish
of Tough, there was formerly a large marsh, now called the
Strath of Tough, or Kincraigie; which was partially drained
in the end of the last Century, when the proprietors are said
to have gained immensely, by the rich crops which this new
soil produced.  That part of it which lies within this parish,
is mossy; and, though there are some strong clay lands in it,
they have, in general, a considerable mixture of moss.  All
these soils of lands, which, in this country, are called laighs,
or laigh lands, yield precarious corn crops, as their wetness
