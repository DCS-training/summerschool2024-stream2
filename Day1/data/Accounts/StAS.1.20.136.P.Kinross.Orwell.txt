evening and morning; a divine institution, too much ne-
glected, if not wholly laid aside, in many parishes in this
Island.  Upon a review of the religious character of the in-
habitants of this parish, we cannot but conclude with these
words, as applicable to them, "They are a people dwelling
"alone*."

   Climate, Diseases, and Longevity.-The inhabitants of this
parish justly boast of the salubrity of the air in which they
breathe.  Situation upon a dry soil, and blessed with many
pure springs of water; washed by the river Queegh on the
south, and by a smaller one just running through the vil-
lage; fenced from the blasts of the stormy north by Kinrofs-
brae; and from the cold east winds by Lomond Hills;
they often enjoy a happy exemption from those diseases
which lurk in marshy districts, and which frequently visit
and affect parishes at no great distance.  The inhabitants of
this parish are not only entirely free of all diseases, but are
strong, robust, and of a heal constitution.  Many of them
live to a very great age.  One woman +, in particular, may
be mentioned, who, though upwards of 94 years, is in good
health, and supports herself by spinning.  She has children,
grandchildren, and great-grand-children, in the same village.
There have been many buried of late in this church-yard,
whose ages have been said to exceed that of this woman;
but to all the accounts of longevity published, or even rela-
ted, we are by no means to give credit, as they are general-
ly exaggerated.

   Fuel and Manner of Living.-It has formerly been ob-
served, that there is no coal in this parish:  the inhabitants
get this article from Kelty, about 6 miles south of this pa-
