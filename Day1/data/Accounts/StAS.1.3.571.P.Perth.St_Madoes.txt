the year.  There are just 2 families of Seceders, and no
other dissenters from the established Church.  The number

   Agriculture and Produce.-The whole ground is arable, ex-
cept a few acres of planting.  It produces all sorts of grain.
Wheat, barley, oats, clover, grass, pease, and beans, are the
ordinary crops, together with a small quantity of potatoes
and flax, which are commonly raised, not for sale, but for
the use of private families.  Turnips are but little cultivated.
Some of the farmers of this parish observe pretty nearly the
most approved method of agriculture, which is now generally
practised in the Carfe of Gowrie, dividing their farm into
6 parts; one sixth part of summer sallow, one for wheat,
one for pease and beans, one for barley, one for clover grass,
and one for oats.  The common rotation of crops is in the
order just now mentioned; but this order is not rigidly ob-
served, even by the best farmers; for wheat is very often
sown after pease and clover, as well as sallow.  The method
of sallowing and sowing grass, though evidently for the ad-
vantage of the farmer, is only coming into general repute.
Many divide their farms into 4 parts, sowing wheat after
pease, barley after wheat, oats after barley, and pease after
oats, with only as much grass as is necessary for food to
their cattle during the summer season.  There is scarce any
such thing as pasture.  The horses and cattle are chiefly fed
within doors.  The parish does much more than supply it-
self with the necessaries of life.  It annually exports a con-
siderable quantity of grain, particularly of wheat and barley,
and, from its vicinity to Perth, and other convenient ports
