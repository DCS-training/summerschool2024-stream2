high pasture ground about 5 s.  Garden grounds around the
town let at about 5 l. per acre.  Till within these few years
past, a great proportion of the garden-stuffs used in Paisley
was brought from Glasgow.  The number of farms seems
rather diminishing, but not in any great degree.  Their ex-
tent is, in general, from 40 to 100 acres.  Few farmers pay
more than 120 l. per annum of rent; the most of them about

grain, their chief commodity, do not rise; and if, in conse-

rise upon servants wages.  A little more regard to the inte-
rest of the farmer will not, perhaps, be found so very incon-
sistent with that of the manufacturer as seems to have been
imagined of late, when all this part of the country was in a
flame during the dependance of the corn-bill, the operation
of which not one in a thousand understood.  The number
