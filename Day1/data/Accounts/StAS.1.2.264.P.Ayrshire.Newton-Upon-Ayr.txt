taking the sense of the freemen.  This method, however, on
account of their numbers, is sometimes a hindrance to business.
The accounts of the treasurer are open to the inspection of e-
very freeman, and he is accountable to the community at large.
The right of succession to their freedoms is limited.  A son
succeeds to his father; and a widow, not having a son, en-
joys the property of her husband as long as she lives.  But as
the female line is excluded, the lots or freedoms frequently
revert to the town, who dispose of them to the most industrious
inhabitants of the place, on their advancing a certain sum of
money, which is placed in the public fund.  Each freedom is valu-
ed at L. 25, though none have given so much for it.  The com-
mon revenue of the burgh, exclusive of these freedoms, is
small.  It arises from certain feu duties; the rent of a mill,
a ropework, some carpenters yards, and other small proper-
ties, which produce about L. 60 per annum; but of late years,
they have derived considerable profit from the coal works in
their estate.  This fund, however, is precarious, and uncer-
tain.

   The town,-its Grounds, and Surface.-The town prin-
cipally consists of one large street, about 680 yards in length,
and about 80 feet in breadth.  It is unfortunately incumber-
ed near the bridge, with a mill, etc. the removal of which,
would be a great convenience and improvement.  There are
three other streets in the parish, but their extent is not great.  In
that part of it, called Garden-street, there formerly stood a
large dwelling-house, denominated Newtonca-stle, which
was, for a long time, the property of the Wallaces of Craigie;
but now some part of the wall, which inclosed the garden, a-
lone remains.  Thirty houses have been built in the town
within these thirteen years; but ten of them on old founda-
tions.
