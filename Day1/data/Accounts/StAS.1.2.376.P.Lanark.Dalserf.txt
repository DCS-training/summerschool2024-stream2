   Cultivation and Produce.-The modes of cultivation and
rotation of crops practised in this parish are various.  The
chief of them are the following:  The land is followed in sum-
mer, with repeated turnings; it is then manured with lime
and dung, or a compost made up of these ingredients and a
quantity of earth; and sown with wheat in the end of Au-
gust, or as early as possible in the following month.  The
wheat crop is followed by pease, or a mixture of pease and
beans:  these again by oats, and again oats, or perhaps bar-
ley and grass feed, with two or three plowings, follow the
oats, and after that a crop or two of hay, and then pasture.
Or, the manure is laid upon the pasture in Autumn, and the
land plowed, and sown with pease and beans in the spring; af-
ter which two crops of oats, followed by grass, sown with the
last.  Those, who adhere most to the culture of barley, sow
it after a crop of pease and beans, with spring-fallowing and
dung, upon the crost-land, that is, the land lying nearest the
farm house, which has been enriched by all the manure, made
there, being continually laid upon it:  But the old distinction
between crost and outfield is fast wearing out, and all the
parts of the farm are now mostly treated in the same manner;
so that there is now less barley sown than formerly.  Besides, in
this parish, which was once famous for producing excellent
barley, the culture of this grain has, of late years, been much
less successful; the returns neither being so abundant, nor the
quality so good, which has tended greatly to discourage it.-
This has been, by some, attributed to the wet, backward
springs, prevalent for a good many years past, which have pre-
vented the proper preparation of the stubborn clay soil, for the
reception of the seed; and the cold summers, which have in-
jured the growth of this tender plant.  Others ascribe it to the
culture of wheat becoming more prevalent, which takes away
a great part of the manure, formerly bestowed on the barley,
