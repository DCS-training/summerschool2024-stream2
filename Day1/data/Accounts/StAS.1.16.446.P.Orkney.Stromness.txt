From the above list it appears, that the average number of
vessels which pass this way in a year, is 312 1/4.  Before the
peace in 1763, 450 or 500 vessels have passed this way in
a year.  The reason why the number passing now is not
so great as formerly, is, that many now go through Pent-
land Frith, who formerly used to pass by Stromness, as
they have now become better acquainted with that frith.
And as a light-house is now erected on the Pentland Skir-
ries in that frith, it may be presumed that still a greater
number will pass that way, and a less number by Strom-
