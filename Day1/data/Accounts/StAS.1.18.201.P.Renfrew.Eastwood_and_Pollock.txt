price of labour, some intelligent persons have begun to lay
down their farms chiefly in grass.  In general, about one

the demand for several of the articles of living.  This leads
to industry and the desire of improvement.  The wealth of
the farmer increases; and, he has both sufficient means and
inducements to cultivate his grounds to the utmost.  This
mode of arguing is natural; but by fixing our attention upon
one view of an object, other views equally natural and just
