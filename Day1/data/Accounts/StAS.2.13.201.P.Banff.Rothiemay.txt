	register nor minutes. There is a blank in the baptismal registers
	from 30th July 1710 till 1748, and in the marriage registers from

	parish are among the oldest, if not the oldest, within the Synod of
	Moray. Though they appear to have been kept in general with
	great regularity, yet they have been preserved in a very careless
	manner. Considerable parts of them are lost, and the early bap-
	tism and marriage registers are in a very mutilated state. A few
	of the parishioners, impressed with the value of these records, are
	about to raise a subscription to have them rebound.
