     of Logie.

Haldane, in the years 1761, 1762, 1763, and 1764, a com-
pany of gentlemen from England, along with the proprietor,
laid out a considerable sum of money in working this mine;
and they got about 50 barrels silver ore, of which four
barrels made a ton, and each ton was valued at London
at L. 60 Sterling.  One Dr Twiffe, to whom the ore was
consigned, became bankrupt, which put an end to the ad-
venture.
