islands, and by the superior skill in making it, the quantity
is doubled.  Forty years ago the price it gave at market was
40 or 50 s. per ton; but for 20 years past, it has given from
5 L. to 7 L. or even 8 L. a ton, which has greatly stimulated
the industry of the people to make it.  It was thought for-
merly that only the tang which grows on the rocks could
be made into kelp; but within these 20 years it is found,
that sea plants of whatever kind can be made into kelp, and
of equal quality, as well as more abundant quantity, than the
other, provided the salts are not washed away by rain, for
great rains render it useless, or, if burnt, produces but little,
and bad kelp.
   There is no island in the Orkneys of the same extent of
sea coast, that produces equal quantity with the isle of San-
day.  It generally produces one-fourth or one-fifth of the
whole kelp made in all the Orkney islands; so that when
2500 tons are made in all the Orkneys, 500 or 600 tons of
that is made in Sanday.  Highland kelp is preferred at Li-
verpool; but at Newcastle, and on the east coast of England,
the Orkney kelp is preferred, especially by the manufacturers
of crown glass.  The alkaline salts are what constitute the va-
lue of this commodity; and chemists say, those contained in
kelp are of the most impure kind, and not equal to the ba-
rilla from Spain, produced from the herb cali, and there-
fore kelp sells for one-fifth of the price of barilla.-620 tons
have been made in Sanday one season; but the usual or ave-
rage quantity may be from 500 to 550 tons.-120 tons has
been made in the isle of North Ronaldshay; but from 90 to
100 tons may be about the average quantity.  The value of
estates has been so raised by this commodity, that an estate
which 70 years ago was not worth 40 L. Sterling a-year, is
now worth 300 L. yearly.
