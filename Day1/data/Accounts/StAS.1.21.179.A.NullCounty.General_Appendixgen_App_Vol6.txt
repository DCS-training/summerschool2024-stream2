three feet for walls; over which he throws a roof, such as
that by which other cottages are commonly covered.
   Upon the sortest parts of the moss even there walls cannot
be obtained.  In such places the houses are built with peat
dug out of the moss, and closely compressed together while
in a humid state*.  It is necessary even to lay upon the sur-
face a platform of boards to prevent the walls from sinking;
which they have frequently done when that precaution was
neglected.  After all, to stamp with the foot will shake the
whole fabric as well as the moss for fifty yards around.  This,
at first, startled the people a good deal; but custom soon ren-
dered it familiar.
   The colonists have now made considerable advancement
in rearing better habitations for their comfort and conve-
nience.  Their huts of turf are but temporary lodgings.  As
soon as they have cleared a little ground, they build houses
of brick; when the proprietor a second time furnishes them
with timber gratis.  It has also been found necessary to relieve
them entirely from the payment of the burdensome tax up-
on bricks; a tax which surely was never intended to fall on
such poor industrious adventurers; and which, without this
assistance, would have proved a most effectual bar to the em-
ployment of these materials.
   There are now erected in the moss 69 brick-houses, sub-
stantially built with lime.  The total expence amounted to
1033 L. sterling.  And it is a very comfortable circumstance,
that the money expended upon these houses is mostly kept
in circulation among the inhabitants themselves: for as a
number of them have learned not only to manufacture but
also to build bricks, and as others who have horses and carts

been observed, it is impossible to erect houses in any shape.
