district to take cognizance of this and other grievances.  The
last particular we shall mention, under the head of disadvan-
tage, is not confined to this parish only, but is equally felt in
the parishes around us, viz. the personal service of the te-
nants.  These, however, were formerly more grievous than
at present; for it is not long since the farmers, their servants,
and horses, must have been ready at a call from the laird
when he had any operations to carry on on his farm, or o-
therwise.  They ploughed, harrowed, manured, and reaped,
the landlord's farm, while their own were often neglected.
Here, however, we must observe, that, in former times,
these services, though a burden, were not such a grievance
as they would be now.  The rents were then low, and mo-
ney scarce.  Hence the services made a considerable part of
the revenue which landlords derived from their lands.  But
now the case is altered; and, wherever tenants are expected
to thrive, personal services must be dispensed with, and
commuted.  That which has been longest kept up, is the
providing a certain quantity of peats or fuel for the master
yearly, which interferes much with the labours of the hus-
bandman, as his whole time is employed in providing his 
own and his landlord's fuel, from the time the seed is sown
till the beginning of harvest.  Thus, he loses all that time in
which he ought to provide manure for his land.  The per-
sonal services of the tenants are, however, always limited,
and as exactly known as the rent of the farm.  Some propri-
etors of lands in the parish have begun, of late, to accept of
a convertion for all services, and also to grant leases to the
industrious part of the farmers.  If these conversions were
moderate, and if the tenants were encouraged to build decent
houses, it would conduce to the comfort of the farmer, and
the interest of the landlord.
