are, wonderfully beneficial; and the value of land has greatly in-
creased.   But though much has been done, there is still a wide
field for improvement. The parish is still almost void of enclo-
sures; and without these, little can be expected from the most in-
dustrious tenant. By far the greater portion of the hill land is still
overburdened with moisture, and destitute of shelter,--draining,
therefore, and planting ought to be particularly attended to. The
sheep-walk should be separated from the improvable land by stone
dikes, and hedging and ditching used fnr dividing it into suitable
enclosures. The larger farms ought to be reduced in size, as I
am afraid little will be effected in the inbringing of land, so long
as the farmer's whole attention is engrossed with his sheep
stock.
	Much of the parish still resembles an unexplored region,--
thousands of acres are to be found in a state of nature, which could
be easily added to the cultivated land. It the waste land in this
and many, other parts of Scotland were reclaimed, it would add
greatly to the resources of the country, be a fruitful source of profit
to the proprietors, and the means of promoting the happiness and
comfort of the labourings-classes;

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--The name of this parish was formerly spelled Mach-
lein, or Machlene, or Machlin; but of late it is more commonly
spelled Mauchline,--Magh signifying" a field or meadow," and
"linn or linne" a pool or lake. Maghlinne, pronounced by the
Scots who succeeded the Gael, Ma1chlin or Mauchline, is the lake-
field or meadow, and this etymology of the name corresponds with
its original local description. As the fields around the town of
Mauchline abound with numerous springs, they must have been
anciently a marsh or meadow.
