of fishing here,) upwards of 120 stone, though some seasons
often not half that quantity.  The salmon-fishing in this
part of the river has for some time past, been much hurt
by a dam-dike belonging to a proprietor of the fishing be-
low, the height of which prevents the salmon from getting
up the stream.  To remedy this evil, recourse has lately
been had to a process at law.  The salmon here are chiefly
caught with the net, though angling both for trout and sal-
mon is likewise frequently practised.  The salmon are rec-
koned in greatest perfection during the months of February,
March, and April.  They are commonly sent for sale to
the Boil-house at Montrose, where, at an average, they
bring about 5 s. the stone; from thence they are exported
to the London market.  When sold on the spot, towards
the beginning of spring, they frequently fetch 6 d. 2
pound.

   Minerals, &c.-There are here several freestone quar-
ries, the rock rather soft, and at no great depth from the
surface.  What stones they have hitherto produced, have
been used by the proprietors for their own private purpo-
ses.  But what particularly deserves notice, is the limework,
which for some years has been carrying on, and is still car-
rying on to greater and greater extent in the district of Pert.
Limestone was first discovered here about the year 1780.
For some time it was wrought in the usual way, but of late
an attempt has been made by the principal proprietor, and
with no inconsiderable success, to work it by mining, in
the same manner as coal is wrought in the southern parts
of Scotland; and a subterraneous drain, intended to be a-
bout 15 fathoms deep, and 400 yards in length, is now be-
gun to be cut for clearing off the water from the quarries.
The main stratum, or vein of limestone, extends from the
Northesk nearly in a S. W. direction, through the whole
