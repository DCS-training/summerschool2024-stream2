comes the second parallel glen behind the house.  The Car-
lop's Glen connects it with the Elk at the village, making a
pats between the two, and the glen) descending from the
Harbour Craig, receives the stream at its lowest extremity,
and unites them betwixt the house and the Steel.  West
from the rocks, the Dean runs along the foot of the Carlop's
from its whole length, and assumes a pastoral and singular
appearance.  From the flat at the bottom rise three little
green hills, at equal distances from each other, and also at
equal distances from the two sides of the Dean, called the
Holehaugh Know, Dun Kaim, and the Picket Craig The
first and last are almost perfect cones, covered with dry green.
turf, and of the same size, with this only difference, that the
last is sharper than the other, with a rocky summit full of
little caverns.  Dun Kaita is triple the size of the end ones,
is of a long oval shape, likewise covered with dry smooth
turf, and in the middle is quite flat on the top.  It, and the
Holehaugh Know, are seen from the public road.  All the
high banks and scenery around, is of the same uniform ver-
dure; and all the transitions, except the summit of the Picket
Craig, and the sharp point of the Know, are gradual and un-
dulating.  On the middle top of Dun Kaim it is proposed to
erect the monument to Ramsay.  From the bank below the
Carlop's Hill, between the Know and Dun Kaim descends,
in a high cascade, a small rivulet called the Lin Burn, that
after running over strata of irons and red and white limestone,
immediately joins the Carlop's Burn, on the other side of the
Dean.  On the top of the same bank, opposite to Dun Kaim,
and in a parallel direction, and at equal distances, are seven
natural pits or excavations of different depths; and betwixt
these and the Dean, the bank is composed of another stratum
of lime stone, of a clouded mixture of greyish greens white,
and pink colours.  Farther on, and a little beyond the
