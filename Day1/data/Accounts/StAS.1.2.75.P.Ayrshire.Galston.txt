     of Galston.

whole arable land in the parish may be calculated at three
times as much, or 7200 acres; of which one-third is plough-
ed, another pastured, and the remainder cut for hay.
   After six years rest, and liming the land at the rate of 100
bolls of flacked lime per acre, it is usual to take three succesive
crops of oats.  The lime is spread upon the green swaird be-
fore plowing, sometimes not many weeks before the ground
is plowed, which must occasion much of the lime being
lost at the bottom of the furrow; yet it is astonishing what
large crops are produced in this way.-Very little bear or
barley is sown.  Pease, beans, etc. thrive extremely well, and
should certainly intervene between the crops of oats; though
there is a great deal of difficulty in preserving them, owing to
frequent rains in harvest.
   The produce is chiefly oats; and, for these two or three
years last past, a small quantity of wheat.-Potatoes are
raised in great quantities, both by the farmers and by the in-
habitants of the village; the last renting the land nearest them,
at 3 d. 1/2 and 4 d. per fall, and manuring and dreffing the crop
for themselves.  And though the tradesmen might certainly
buy their potatoes as cheap from the farmers, yet this practice
tends much to promote their health, and amusement at bye-
hours, when otherwise they would be idle, and ought there-
fore to be encouraged.
   One great article of produce is cheese, made after the Dun-
lop manner, and equally good*.  It is sent to Kilmarnock,
Paisley, Glasgow, and Edinburgh.
   The farmers, in general, raise thier own stocks of black

*The parish of Dunlop, was the first, in this part of Scotland, 
that took the lead in making excellent cheese for a distant market.
They resemble in taste some of the better sorts of English cheese,
though not  yet brought to equal perfection.
