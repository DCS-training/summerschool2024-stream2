   Several miles to the N.E. of Tulchan, and on the north
side of Beinn-glo, is Lochainn, i.e. Loch-ambain, or the Ri-
ver that is slow like a loch.  It runs from Lochloch, towards
the Tilt.  Upon Lochainn, are the vestiges of the palace, in
which the Earl of Atholl entertained King James V, his mo-
ther, the French ambassador, &c. in a most sumptuous man-
ner, as is mentioned in history; and, which was burnt to the
ground, as soon as the king left it.
   On the south side of Beinn-glo, on a rising ground, are to
be seen the traces of a semicircular work, fronting the west.
A rill runs through the centre of it; the banks of it appear to
have been well secured by large stones; and, in the front, for
a considerable extent, there is a moss or bog, called Moine-
nan-gal, i.e. the Moss of the Lowlanders, -of the strangers,
or of the enemies, who are said to have been there defeated.
In the last generation, one Robertson found two pans, funk in
this moss, which seemed to have been very old.  Capt. Wil-
liam Robertson of Lude, who examined this camp, thinks
the Danes built it, in attempting to force their way, through
the heart of the country, to their possessions in the Hebrides.
A party of Baliol's friends are said to have passed this way,
after having been defeated, by King Robert Bruce, at Inver-
chadain and Dailchoisny, in Bunrannoch: But whether this
camp is not much older, or whether they had a camp there at
all, is uncertain.
   To the eastward of the camp, along Glengairnog, are to be
seen some pieces of a road, called Rod-na-banrinn, or the
Queen's Road; by which, probably, one or more of the Queens
used to go to the forest of Atholl.  On the top of the rock of
Fonn-a-vuic, is a large round castle, which, from its high and
inaccessible situation, must have been very strong.
   In the N W. corner of Lochtummel, there is a small island,
partly artificial, on which Duncan Ravar M'Donald, the chief
