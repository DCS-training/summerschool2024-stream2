Locharmoss*, perhaps it might originally have been named
Mosswold, or that division nearest to the moss; which, from
the situation of the church, has been a striking object for time
immemorial, and almost the whole of which (for 12 miles in
length, and full 3 English miles in breadth in some places)
is seen by the observer in one view.  Now, if we allow that
the latter part of the name is not according to the original
spelling, we may as well suppose mous, as now used, to have
formerly been moss.-The parish is a part of that district for-
merly called the stewartry of Annandale, now united to the
shire of Dumfries.  It is, in length, between 4 and 5 English
miles, from north to south; and, excluding the moss, nearly
about 2 English miles in breadth, on an average, from east
to west; but, including the moss, its figure nearly resembles
that of a heart, narrowing both on the north and south
quarter, as it descends to the moss, and still growing nar-
rower, till it terminates on the small river Lochar, which
divides it from Carlaverock.  It would measure from the east
to this south-westerly point between 4 and 5 miles.

   Surface and Soil.-The surface of the parish is plain and
level, rather than hilly; and, though there are several rising
grounds in it, they have so gentle an ascent as to be cultiva-
ted with the plough to the very summit.-The soil is vari-
ous; two or three farms adjoining the moss have a consider-
able quantity of pasture ground, which is wet and marshy,
and some of the arable land is also wet; while other parts
of there farms, rising considerably above the level of Lochar-
moss, are light and sandy.  A considerable part of the parish
next to these, though rising a little above them, appears, for
