or about 110 square miles, probably averaging 20,000 tons per
acre, but, taking the medium thickness of the whole field at
five yards, it will give to each mile 15,448,000 cubic yards,
which, multiplied by 110, the number of square miles, gives
1,703,680,000 cubic yards of coal.  Rosehall, Carnbroe, Wood-
hall, Stevenson, Carfin, and Cleland, all properties in the parish of
Bothwell, and on all of which collieries are now at work, would
supply an annual output of 400,000 tons for upwards of 3000
years.
   The thickness of the various seams in the three following dis-
tricts of this great basin is as follows :-

At Cleland coal is found 9 feet thick; at Chapel, 7 feet 8 inches;
at Pickerstonhill, 9 feet; at Garion Gill, 8 feet 9 inches; at New-
mains and Catburn, 9 feet, and at Allanton 11 feet.
   The field is intersected by two dikes, which produce considerable
derangement in the metals.  One of these crosses Bothwell pa-
rish at Newarthill, runs to the west by Legbrannoch, passes throuh
the Garion Railway tunnel, and enters the neighbouring parish of
Old Monkland to the north-west, a little to the eastward of Carn-
broe House.  The field, or section thrown in by this dike, is ter-
minated by another which enters the parish at Lauchop Mill,
passes due west through Chapelhall and Monkland Steel Works,
crosses the Calder north of Woodhall House, and probably joins
the other dike near the above-mentioned tunnel.
   Besides the four workable strata above described, about twenty-
six other seams have been observed, varying from a few inches to
one or two feet in thickness.
   Ironstone is also found in considerable quantities in the parish,
and is at present wrought on Woodhall estate, near Holytown, at
Calderbraes, and on the Farm of Greenside, near Newhouse.  lt
is chiefly what is termed the black-band; lies from 15 to 25 fa-
