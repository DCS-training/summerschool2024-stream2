   Advantages, etc.-Our chief advantage, respecting agri-
culture, is the nearness of lime.  In the neighbouring pa-
rish of Grange, it is bought at the quarry for 1 1/2 d.; at the 
kilu for 8 d. and sometimes 7 d. a boll*.  The abundance
of peat here induces most farmers to buy it at the quarry,
and enables some of them, beside supplying themselves, to
bring a profit by retail.  There are about 50 lime-kilns in
the parish.
   To this advantage I wish I could add good roads; but
the proper method of making and repairing these is not
even understood here.  Instead of using for this purpose
that abundance of metal and gravel which nature has sup-
plied, the statute-labour is employed in throwing on the
middle of the roads the contents of the ditches on their
sides, which, being clay or soft earth, so far from impro-
ving them, (unless, perhaps, during the heat of summer),
generally makes them worse than before.  Though inclo-
sing is far advanced in this, compared with neighbouring
parishes, still there is much room for this kind of improve-
ment :  A proof, among others, that a great part of our
land has not yet reached half its value.  Nor has draining
by any means obtained that degree of attention, which a
great part of our land evidently requires, though to this
kind of improvement its natural situation is, in general,
very favourable+.

   Population, etc.-The number of inhabitants is 1125; of
whom, 481 are males, 644 females.  In 1755 it was 1190.
The average of marriages for the last 10 years is 10; that
of births, for the same period, 19; of deaths there is no re-
gister.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The boll of lime here consists of 2 firlots only.

+The mode of farming, and the prices of the various kinds of provisions,
are the same here as in the neighbouring parishes.
