culiar premiums given by Government to other prosessions,
particularly to the church and the law, seem to require, that,
for maintaining some kind of balance, a degree of similar en-
couragement should be given to the teaching of the liberal
arts and sciences.  Without this, a private academy can sel-
dom collect a sufficient number of well qualified teachers, so
as to prevent a single individual from undertaking too many
branches, and becoming what is vulgarly called a Jack of all
trades.

   Time of Lecturing, etc.-The uniform assiduity of the pro-
sessors in the University of Glasgow, and the length of time
which they employ in lecturing, will afford an illustration of
these remarks.  The annual session for teaching, in the Uni-
versity, begins, in the ordinary curriculum, on the tenth of
October; and ends, in some of the classes, about the middle
of May, and in others continues to the tenth of June.  The
lectures, in all the other branches, commence on the first of
November, and end about the beginning of May.  The class
of botany begins on the first of May.
   During this period, the business of the College continues
without interruption.  The professors of humanity, or Latin,
and of Greek, lecture and examine their students, receive
and correct cxercises, three hours every day, and four hours
for two days every week: The professors of logic, moral phi-
losophy and natural philosophy, two hours every day, and
three hours during a part of the session; excepting on Satur-
days, when, on account of a general meeting of the public
students, there is only one lecture given.  The other profes-
sors lecture, in general, one hour every day: The professor
of mathematics, two hours every day, except on Saturdays:
The professor of law, in his public department, two hours.
The professor of practical astronomy gives no public lecture
