the family of Ross from remote antiquity, as may be seen in
the account of the Abbey of Fearn in this parish, towards the
beginning of the thirteenth century. But on the deca of that
monastic institution after the Reformation, tbe lairds of Balna-
gown seem to have been resuming the grants of land, &c., which
their ancestors, the Earls of Ross had been bestowing with so
liberal a hand upon the abbey; for we find that in the year 1580,
on the demission of Robert Colvil, prebendary of Cambuscurry,
(which was in this parish,) Alexander Ross of Balnagown got a
grant from the crown of that prebend for seven years, for the
maintenance of his son, Malcolm, at school; and by its becoming
afterwards the property of another son of Balnagown, it would ap-
pear that he got a perpetual grant of it. In 1601, a charter was
granted by Sir Patrick Murray, * to George Ross of Balnagown, and
his heirs and assignees, of "the lands of Wester-Fearn, Downy,
fishings of Bonar, lands of Easter Rnd Wester Drum of Fearn,
with the half of the manor-place and gardens of Fearn, commonly
called the monastery of Fearn," &c.; the other half of the abbey
lands, possessed by Sir Patrick, fell to the share of Sir William
Sinclair of Mey, son-in-law to Balnagown. The other lands be-
longing to the abbey not contained in the above grant were an-
nexed to the bishopric of Ross, in the year 1607; and in 1609,
David Lindsay, Bishop of Ross, grants a charter to George Ross,
of the "Kirkton of Kincardin, lands of Ardgay, Eddertown," &c.
From this it would appear that the revenues of the monastery were
very great, when it was in the full possession of the rents of these
lands; but at the time of the Reformation its revenues must have
been considerably diminished; for as early as the time of Abbot
M'Fead, (or, as he was frequently called, Abbot Fearn,) who ruled
the monastery from 1440 to 1485, certain farms belonging to the
abbey were feued off to the friends and relatives of the abbots
and commendators (as the titular Protestant abbots of monaste-
ries were commonly called after the Reformation); and every
succeeding incumbent appears to-have followed the same perni-
cious, example, until the evil became past remedy.

<FOOTNOTE>In 1597, the Abbacy of Fearn was erected into a barony, called the "Barony
of Geanies," and given by King James VI. to Sir Patrick (as mentioned in the ac-
count of the "Abbey of Fearn,"); but this grant did not prove a very advantageous
one, for the whole of the lands contained in it, having been either violently or by feus
from the latter	Abbots, kept possession of by the neighbouring0 gentlemen, he found
it so difficult to recover them, that he accepted 18,000 marks from the Laird
of Balnagown, and his son-in-law, Sinclair of May, for the whole barony. (Ancient
Charters, &c.)
