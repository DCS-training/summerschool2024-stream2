necessary for these machines are built in the most substantial man-
ner. The mills which existed at that time have been greatly im-
proved.
   There are five gardens in the parish, called sale gardens, well
stocked with fruit trees in a good state of bearing. The posses-
sions in the village, which are mostly held of Sir John Hall on
leases of ten times three nineteen years, or 570 years, have all
small gardens attached to them.
   Quarries.-There are several wrought quarries of freestone in
the parish,-and it is supposed there are others that might be
wrought if necessary.

yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as

                      V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Means of Communication.-There are in the parish about 6 1/2 miles
of turnpike road,-all in good repair: so also are the cross roads.
An act of Parliament has lately been obtained for building a bridge
over the Whitadder at the Bluestone Ford, in the southern part
of the parish.
   Ecclesiastical State.-No part of the parish lies farther from the
church than 2 1/2 miles. It is at present in pretty good repair: pro-
bably it was built several hundred years ago,-for in one part of
the wall, which was evidently a later addition, there is a tablet dated
1572, with the inscription "HELPE THE PVR." When the body of
the church was rebuilt, the western door, of Saxon architecture,
with a small part of the wall belonging to the ancient fabric, was
with good taste preserved, and the new wall built upon it. There
have been many complaints of the insufficiency of the accommo-
dation to the persons belonging to the Establishment.
   The manse was built in 1757. It is small, but in good repair.
The extent of the glebe is 8 English acres of excellent land,
with half an acre more for the site of houses.
