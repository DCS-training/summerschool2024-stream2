The parochial funds from which the wants of the poor are supplied
consist of collections at church, amounting annually on an ave-
rage of the last five years, to L. 12, 1s. 1d.; of proclamation
fees, to 13s. 9 1/2d.; mortcloth fees, L. 1, 2s. 3d.; and of rent of
land and houses, and interest of money, to L. 20, 5s. 1Od.; in all,
L. 34, 2s. 11 1/2d. There exists among the poor in general a laudable
spirit of independence, which renders them reluctant to apply for
parochial aid, and the acceptance of which they considere as de-
grading.
   Alehouses.-There is only one in the parish, which is evidently
necessary and quite sufficient for the accommodation of the public.
   Fuel-The common fuel is coal, which is partly driven from the
pits at Balbirnie and Orr Bridge, a distance of from eleven to thir-
teen miles from the centre of the parish, and partly from Bal-
merino, a distance of five miles, whither it is imported from New-
castle and Alloa.
   The price at Balmerino of English coals is from 4s. 6d. to 5s.
9d. per boll of 42 stones, or six cwt. and of Scotch coals at about
6s, per boll of 56 stones or 8 cwt. The present price of coals at
Balbirnie is 1s. 6d. per load of 18 stones, and at Orr Bridge is
1s. 3d. per load of 28 stones. Many of the poorer classes use
considerable quantities of wood for fuel, which they get from the
neighbouring plantations.
<FOOTNOTE>Of this money, L. 100 Sterling were bequeathed for behoof of the poor by the
late Colonel and Mrs Baillie of Luthrie, and L. 50 by the late David Gillespie, Esq.
of Kirkton.
