against any opposing force.  In the year 1594, the Earl of Errol
baying joined in the Earl of Huntly's rebellion, James VI., at the
instigation of the politic Lord Lindsay, issued orders for its entire
demolition, which were faithfully executed; and nothing of this
ancient castle now remains but three sides of a square tower, and
some masses of masonry strewed around it.
   Mansion House.-The only modern building is the House of
Leask, built by the late William Cumming Skene Gordon of Park-
hill, about thirteen years ago.  It is a substantial and elegant resi-
dence, and is at present let to Sir William Seton of Pitmedden, Bart.

   Agriculture.-The number of Scotch acres in the parish under
cultivation is about 6000, and the system of husbandry is of the
most improved description.  The farmers are most industrious
and enterprizing, and readily adopt any new improvement, either
in the breed of the cattle or mode of farming.  During the cur-
rency of the present leases, there have been upwards of 900 acres
of waste land brought under tillage, while the rest of the arable
land has been drained, and rendered much more productive.
With the exception of the sand links and peat moss, there is very
little barren or waste land; and in a few years, if no check is im-
posed on the spirit of enterprize, the whole will be reclaimed.
The routine of cropping generally followed is, one crop of oats,
then turnip,or other green crop, next bear or oats, and last two
year grass.  The chief proprietor has a considerable breadth of
land, in his own hand, on which he has grazed, for some years
past, a flock of sheep amounting to the number of from 1200 to
