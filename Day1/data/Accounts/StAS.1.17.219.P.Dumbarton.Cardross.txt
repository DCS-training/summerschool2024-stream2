attention of the heritors, it is kept in the best possible order.
The manse was built about 60 years ago; since that period
it has undergone frequent repairs.  Upon the succession of
the present incumbents in 1791, the heritors, with the great-

Cardross is one of the few parishes in Scotland, where the
right of titular is vested in the incumbent.  From a late in-
vestigation, in ascertaining the right of patronage, it appears,

donation consists in the yearly payment of 5 L. being the in-

master, and placed under the management of the heritors.
Besides this sum, which was bequeathed for the above pur-
pose by a younger branch of the family, the proprietor him-
self executed a deed, disponing to the public teacher a right
to an acre of land, a cow's pasture upon a specified farm, and
5 bolls 1 sirlot of bear, payable from certain other farms up-
