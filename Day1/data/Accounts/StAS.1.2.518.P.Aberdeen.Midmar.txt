difficulty.

   Several chalybeate springs are found here, which, in sero-
phulous and scorbutic habits, have been found highly benefici-
al.  These springs are distinguished at the fountain-head,
from the common element, by a brown viscous substance, ei-
ther adhering to the edge of the rill, or floating on its surface.
They may be traced, in the same manner, at considerable dis-
tance from their sources, by the brown tinsture of their chan-
nel, and of the earth on each side of it.  The water takes a
blue cast upon mixing spirits with it, and is rendered black,
by a small insusion of strong tea, as is the cafe of the well-
known medical spring of Peterhead.-The chief fossil is
granite, of which, an excellent kind, capable of receiving a 
very beautiful polish, is found in different parts of the pa-
rish.

   In the middle of this eminence is the vale of Corrichie,
well known as the scene of a battle, wherein the contending
parties were headed by the Marquis of Huntly, and the Earl of
Murray.  Huntly fell in this engagement, in which his for-

unfortunate Mary.  A small possession, on the north side of the
hill retains, at this day, the name of Craig-Hume, in memory
of one of that family, who was slain in that battle, and is in-
terred in the neighbourhood.  It is proper also to observe here,
that the name of Queen's Chair, is given to an excavation, I know
not whether natural or artificial, on the side of a rock, near
this valley.  Here Mary is said to have fat, while returning
southwards from Aberdeen, to view the scene of the recent
engagement.  In the neighbourhood of this spot, a remarkable
echo is occasioned by the contiguity of three small eminences,
from two of which, and the adjoining wood, the last accents
