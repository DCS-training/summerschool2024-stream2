     Statistical Account

of the farmer cannot permit him to fallow any considerable
part of his grounds; it consequently follows that the grounds
are very dirty and full of weeds, by which also the crop is
hurt.
   It may consequently appear, that this climate is better
adapted to raising crops of grass, but that has not been at-
tempted, except in very small spots.  Straitened circum-
stances, short leases, and the payment of the rent in malt,
are bars to this.  To carry this plan into execution, it
would be necessary that the proprietors, or the tenants,
should have the command of money to defray the expence
of inclosing, which has not been the case with the residing
proprietors, or their tenants, for some time past.  It would
also, perhaps, require a better market for cattle than is to
be found at the village of Stromness.

   From the great uncertainty of the seasons, and conse-
quent variableness of the crop, no precise or fixed estimate
can be made of the whole produce.  The ground that each
farm contains is not ascertained, and few or none keep an
exact account of the produce of their farms, nor can they
well do it, as they are in the practice of keeping up their
stock of horses by buying young ones of a year old, on
whom they bestow a considerable part of their crop, before
they are reared fit for tilling.  If an estimate was made of
the whole produce, it would be mere conjecture.  If we
were to hazard such conjecture, the principles upon which
we would proceed would be these.  We would first ascer-
tain the number of acres cultivated by each plough, and
then fix on what we know an acre of middling soil has, or
may produce, in seasons not unfavourable.  Upon there
principles it will stand thus:
