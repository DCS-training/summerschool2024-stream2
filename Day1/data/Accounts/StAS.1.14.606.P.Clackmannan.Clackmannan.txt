     Statistical Account

the parish of Tillicoultry.-There are no hills in the pa-
rish:  the ground, however, is very much varied; but none'
of it to sleep as to interrupt the purposes of agriculture.

   Villages.-Clackmannan is the head town of the county.
It is beautifully situated on the eminence, gently rising
out of a plain, from E. to W., to the height of 190
feet, above the level of the river Forth.  On each side
of the village, the ground has a gardual descent; but is
more bold and rapid from the W. end, where the old
tower of the Clackmannan is placed.-The scenery, beheld
from this tower, is uncommonly picturesque and beauti-
ful; and has been veiwed with admiration by every tra-
veller of taste.  The whole country around forms, as it
were, one grand amphitheatre, where all the objects are
distinctly seen, yet not so near, as to disgust the eye.
They are, at the same time, infinitetly varied.  Beyond
the town of Stirling, 9 miles to the W., the high moun-
tains of Ben-More, Ben-Lady, and Ben-Lomond, are seen
at the distance of 20 miles, raising their romantic tops
above the clouds.  From the bold scenery of the town and
castle of Stirling, and the high jutting, rugged rocks a-
round it, the river Forth descends through a valley of se-
veral 1000 acres of the richest carse land; sometimes split-
ting asunder, and forming, here and there, small beauti-
ful islands, which are always green.  The fields, on eve-
ry side of it, exhibit, in time of harvest, the most lux-
uriant, variegated, prospect, which the eye can behold.
The various windings of the river are, at the same time,
diversified in every possibility of serpentine form, that can
add the most exquisite beauty to the surrounding scenery.
It passes by the village of Clackmannan, at the distance of
an English mile to the S., where it is a mile in breadth.
