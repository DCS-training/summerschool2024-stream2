   Miscellaneous Observations.-In 1782 and 1783, the pa-
rish suffered exceedingly by the bad crops, and some of the
tenants have hardly yet recovered them.  At the same time,
in some places, the meal was very good and wholesome, and
the parish, upon the whole, would have been able to have
supported itself.  The crops of late years have been ex-
ceedingly good.  The parish is a beautiful field, and a noble
subject for improvement.  If the small brook, formerly
mentioned, could be carried into the sea at Ward, and
a harbour made out, that could recieve small vessels, which
might lie in safety at all seasons, (of which there ap-
pears the highest degree of probability,) a stourishing vil-
lage would be the certain consequence.  But if the bottom
of the brook could be deepened, so as to recieve such ves-
sels as generally trade upon this coast, then, a very fine
town would soon be built, and many a vessel saved, which,
in time of danger or distress,  durst not look at Peterhead,
and would not be able to reach Aberdeen.-Were the
Earl of Errol to employ a small sum annually, in carrying
forward such improvements as the situation of the parish
points out, and resolutely to persist in seeing them judici-
ously executed, he would not only have the glory of im-
proving and beautifying a large tract of country, but the
satisfaction of being proprietor of one of the finest pieces of
property, in the North of Scotland.
