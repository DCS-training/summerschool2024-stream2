   The use of oxen, for the purposes of labour, is a thing al-
together unknown, or at least never practiced, in this part
of the country.  The wauk or fulling mill, and the three
corn-mills, in this parish, are all upon the river of Ayr.
The seasons of sowing and repairing are much the same here
as in the neighbouring parishes.
   From the general poverty of the tenants, and other cau-
ses, lime has hitherto been less used, as a manure, in this
parish than in some of the neighbouring parishes, which lie
at a greater distance from it.  As their circumstances have,
of late, been improving, however, they are now beginning

of the arable lands was only about 5 s. per acre; but as
these leases expire, the rent is from 10 s. to 12 s. and, in
the immediate neighbourhood of the villages, from 20 s. to

   In the course of the 3 last years, the occupier of a pen-
dicle of 5 acres, consisting mostly of moss, has introduced a
method of cultivating this kind of soil which bids fair to

the lazy beds in which potatoes are sometimes planted.
Between these beds he makes a trench, throwing its con-
tents upon the beds, in such a manner that the upper sur-
face may lie directly upon the under.  This part of the
work he executes in the autumn and winter, and then
