a few fetch more.  The land to the S. of the post road,
though the greatest part of it be of a good quality, lets at a
rate considerably lower.  The whole of the parish is arable.
There are, however, upwards of 100 acres of common, and a
considerable portion of link ground, still in a state of nature.
Improved muir lets at 15 s. and 20 s. per acre; inclosed and
cultured links at 36 s. and 40 s.  The high rent of these
lands is owing to the peculiar advantages of their situation.
The face of the country is remarkably pleasant, rising by a
gentle ascent from the sea to the southermost extremity of
the parish.  The town of Tranent commands an extensive
view of the adjacent country, the Frith of Forth, and the
opposite shore*.

   Property and Agriculture.-The parish is divided amongst
9 greater, and nearly double that number of smaller, proprie-
tors.  Three of the first either statedly or occasionally reside,
and most of the latter.  The valued rent of the parish ex-
ceeds 10,900 L. Scotch; and the real rent, inclusive of houses.
and gardens, 6000 L. Sterling+.  There are in the parish 3
farmers who rent above 300 L.-5 above 200 L.-4 above
100 L.-8 above 50 L.-and 17 above 20,-besides a great
number possessing from 40 to 5 acres, or under.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The climate is exceedingly good, and the air healthy and
dry.  The town of Tranent has long been reputed particularly
healthy.  Intermittent fevers, in particular, are seldom known.
Inoculation being little practiced, the small-pox is frequent.
The year 1792 is, however, an exception to the general healthi-
ness of the place.  An epidemical fever, of a putrid nature,
prevailed upwards of 10 months, and carried off a great num-
ber in the prime of life.

+Houses and gardens were rated a few years ago at 425 L.
8 s. 9 d.  Deducting this from the 6000 L. the remainder, 5575 L.
will be nearly the rent of the land.
