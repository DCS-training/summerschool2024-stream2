pense, to this last class of servants, is more inadequate to their
services than what is exacted by the former.  Often, especial-
ly during winter, whilst the men pass away the long evenings
at their ease, and without furthering the interest of their em-
ployers, the busy and conscientious house-maid is unremit-
tingly engaged, in some necessary employment in the family.
Let not their earnings then, advanced as they are, be grudged;
but let all, who respect the female character, and female uti-
lity, regret, that these earnings are often thrown away on
the gewgaws of vanity and fashion.  Every man of humanity
is pleased to see them clad in decent and suitable apparel;
but it is painful to observe, that, what should be a support to
their future families, and a provision for sickness and old age,
is misapplied in the purchase of silks, laces, lawns and tinsel!
But the moralist may speculate on this female infirmity as he
chuses; as far as the lass has cash or credit, to procure braws,
she will, step by step, follow hard after what she deems grand
and fine in her betters*.

   Inn.-There is an excellent inn in the parish, at Dalmaly.
No where in the highlands has more attention been paid to
the accommodation of the traveller, than on the property of
Lord Breadalbane.  In a line of public road, of above 90
miles in length, extending from Inveraray to Perth, good inns,
with suitable offices, are built, at proper stages, and kept in
repair, at considerable expence, by his lordship +.  Care also
is taken to find inn-keepers qualified for their charge, and of
civil and obliging deportment to their employers.-And to
enable them to provide seasonably for their guests, farms, on
easy terms, are annexed to the different stages.
