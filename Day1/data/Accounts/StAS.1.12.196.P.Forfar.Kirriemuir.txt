   An elegant church was built here in 1787, to which Charles
Lyell, Esq. of Kinnordy, the principal heritor and superior
of the town, added a handsome spire, which is seen through
the whole of Strathmore.  The manse was built in 1774;
but so ill executed, that it was found necessary to repair it
in 1787.  It is now a substained and commodious house.

*Mr. Hendry of the parish of Kensington, London, a native of this parish,
by his will, bequeathed to the minister and elders 1400 L.  Sterling, in trust, the
interest of 1200 L. to be laid out in educating, and furnishing with books, pen.
ink, and paper, 12 boys, or, as many more as it will educate; and the interest
of the remaining 200 L. to be paid to the schoolmaster for keeping the accounts.
Some difficulties arise about some parts of Mr. Hendry's property, and the ex-
clusion of the trust in his will; so that his executors did not think themselves
safe to pay the money without an amicable suit in Chancery.  This was begun
in 1784; and in 1786, the Chancellor found the money due, with 1 1/2 years in-
terest; but, instead of ordering it to be paid, he directed it to be laid out in
the funds, and a plan to be given in how it was to be expended.  This was done
soon after; but the legacy has not yet been paid.  It is, however, expected that
payment will be ordered in the course of next term.
