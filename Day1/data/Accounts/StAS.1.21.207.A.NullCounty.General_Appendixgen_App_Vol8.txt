told, more than 14 inches of sand were laid on some fields
by the west winds.
   There are some limestone quarries in this parish, but, ow-
ing to the scarcity and dearth of fuel, cannot be turned to ac-
count.  There is no moss, but a kind of sulphureous turf,
which, when used in the houses of the tenants, destroys all the
