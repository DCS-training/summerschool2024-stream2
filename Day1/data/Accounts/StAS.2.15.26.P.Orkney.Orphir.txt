Ployed at the factories.  A mechanic.  L. 25 a-year.  The en-
gagement is now for five years, and at the end of three years every
one is advanced according to his merit.  The great object was to
save as much as might render his future days at home, easy and
comfortable.
   Many of the young men also used to engage at Stromness for
Greenland and Davis's Straits.  There are only ten thus em-
ployed, this season.
   The forming of the public road has been a great improvement,
so that carts are now in general use; whereas, formerly, loads were
carried on the backs of horses.  The lately built cottages are much
neater than the old ones.  The division of the common is also an
improvement, and has induced a few families to come from neigh-
bouring parishes to settle where the ground may be cultivated.
   It is also pleasant to observe the importance given to education,
which will give the rising generation and their succeeding race a
very great advantage over their forefathers.
