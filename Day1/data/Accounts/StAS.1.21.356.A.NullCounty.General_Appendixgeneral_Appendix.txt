which might be about 5000 families.  Allowing each family
20 carts of coals, or 60,000 tons, which would cost, for 24
miles of land carriage, 25 s. at least each ton, the whole ex-
pences would amount to 75,000 l. sterling annually.  The
same quantity by the Great Canal would only cost 6,500 l.
and by the tide-way of the Forth only 3,000 l.  In the for-
mer way the manufacturer saves 68,500 l. and in the latter
way 72,000 l.  No wonder, then, that the fine river Teith is
neglected, that its banks are solitary, and the surrounding
villages mean and contemptible.
   If such a saving would arise on the article coal; how much
would be the profit on all the other commodities that such
works would require.  It commonly happens, that where we
meet with rapid rivers and water-falls, the country is poor,
and produces very little of the necessaries of life.  It is so
with the banks of the Teith above Callander; the country
is rugged and barren; and were any works to be erected
there, the importations for the subsistence of the workmen
would be very great, and the land carriage would render liv-
ing too expensive.  In short, were any to attempt manufac-
tories on this river, during existing circumstances, he must
want workmen; as no person would pay the high price of
provisions which the inland situation of the district would
create, while he could get work, and be served better, at
other places.
   But, were the river Teith made navigable, this part of the
country would very soon become flourishing and wealthy.  It
would have immediate communication with the rich country
along the Forth, and with the London market; and the low
price of carriage would render every undertaking easy and
inviting.  The multitude of water streams produced by this
rugged district of the country, though hitherto neglected,
may soon be highly esteemed and properly attended to.  Such
