farms of different complexions, he has it in his power to sort
his cattle in such a manner, as to suit each farm.-He has it
in his power to vary their food, and to change them from
farm to farm, as he perceives them healthy, taking on flesh,
or the contrary.  3dly, In the manner of buying his cattle
from the Highland dealers, he is very particular: he must
have the worst and oldest, draughted again and again from
the drove, before he will purchase it; by this means, he ac-
quires none but healthy cattle; perhaps they may cost him 2
few shillings more per head, but it is soon repaid.-Scarcely
ever any of his cattle die; and they are so evenly, that it is
hardly in the power of the butcher to challenge a bad beast;
by this management, his profits are uniform over the whole
head; whereas, when cattle are shot, as it is termed, the pro-
fits are greately diminished.^
   We are not to imagine that the profits of graziers in our
brae lands are very great; when the cattle are bought in at
Martinmas, and kept for one year in the pasture, two
guineas per head is expected as grass-mail; when bought at
the Whitsunday market and kept till Martinmas, one guinea
is expected per head; when these profits are deficient, it is
considered as a bad year by the grazier; and when they ex-
ceed, it is considered as good times.*

bridge gave way; and he was thrown into the river; falling upon a stone, he
was killed on the spot.

*Notwithstanding the district of Campsie seems to be so well adapted for
the grazing of cattle, perhaps there are some defects attending their plan,
which it may be proper to mention: 1 st, It seems to be the misfortune of the
Scotch in general, and particularly of the people of this district, that when
