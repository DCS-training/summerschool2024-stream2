10 s. 6 d.  The want of a grammar-school for classical edu-
cation is sensibly felt.-None of our poor go a-begging;
and none, so far as I can trace, have died for want.  There
are at present on the roll 18 persons.  The interest of mor-
tified sums for their relief amount yearly to L. 12 0 0
Our weekly collection, etc. amount at an ave-
   rage, to                                       9 0 0
                                              ---------
Making in all for the relief of the poor,    L.  21 0 0

   When a person on the poor's list dies, the session consider
themselves as entitled, in name of the surviving poor, to
whatever furniture, clothes or effects the deceased may
have left, although we do not require them on admission
to sign any deed to that purpose.  What they leave is sel-
dom claimed by the session, but being for the most part of
little value, is commonly given to such of their indigent re-
lations or neighbours as were kind and attentive to them
in their last illness.  Besides the resources already men-
tioned, it may be proper to state, that few years pass with-
out most generous and well judged presents to our poor from
the Hopetoun family.  Nor is this the only parish which
experiences their bounty.  Wherever they have property,
and in many parishes where they have none, the poor are
the objects of their frequent beneficence.

   Prics, Wages, etc.-There is no market for butcher-
meat in the parish.  The ordinary way of being provided
in it is, for a family, or different families united, to buy a
whole bullock, or sheep, or sow, etc.  Of the two market-
towns no most us, the one is 6, and the other 10 miles off.
When we'd send to either of these, we generally pay for
beef and mutton 6 d. the pound, English weight; lamb is
commonly a little dearer.  The following articles can be
had in the parish: geese at 3 s. each, ducks 6 d. hens 6 d.
