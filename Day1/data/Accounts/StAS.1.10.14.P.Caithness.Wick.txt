   Lakes.-In this parish are some fresh water lakes or lochs.
One at Hempriggs furnishing a sufficiency of water for a waulk-
mill, a distillery, a snuff-mill, a lint-mill, and three corn-mills.
There is another loch, curiously situated on the top of a hill,
which notwithstanding, never overflows its banks.  The loch
of Wester, communicating with the sea, produces plenty of
excellent salmon-trout, some of them two feet in length, remark-
able for flavour, delicacy, and richness.  Hitherto they have
been caught only for the use of the neighbourhood; but might
become a valuable article of commerce, if their excellence was
known to the luxurious citizens of London.  In March and
April, all these lakes are periodically visited by swans, that
resort to them for a temporary resting place:  In their passage
to the north, they wait here till all their companions are as-
sembled, when, on the approach of good weather, they pair
and fly off in troops to the Orkney islands and other places,
in which they breed; they return again with their young to
the Caithness lakes, about the month of October.  Their mu-
sic, at a distance, in a calm night, when sitting together as it
were in close council, on the surface of the water, has no un-
pleasing effect*.  It is said, that, when young, they are de-
licious eating; but they are not meddled with in this county.
It is certain however, that, in the time of Edward IV. they
were held in such esteem in England, that, by act of Parlia-
ment, none were allowed to keep swans, 'Other than the son
'of our fovereign lord the king.'  They are remarkable prog-

*One of those swans, when its mate had been shot, has been
known to remain a whole summer season on the loch, lamenting
its deserted slate in doleful notes.
