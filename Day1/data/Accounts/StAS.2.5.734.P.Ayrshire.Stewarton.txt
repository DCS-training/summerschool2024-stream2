until he came to the ford of the Annock, at Bridgend, where he
fell dead off his horse. This took place on the 12th April 1586,

	Antiquities.--The only antiquities worth mentioning, are the
remains of two castles, once the seats of the Cuninghames of
Corsehill and Auchenharvie, branches of the Cuninghames,
Lords of Kilmaurs, by far the most powerful family in the dis-

Alexander, Esq. Advocate, the author of "My Grandfather's
Farm," who is a native of this parish, and now resides in London.

Brae, on his property, he discovered three urns containing human

cient inhabitants of this country buried their dead.
	Modern Buildings.--The most worthy of notice are those of
Mr Cuninghame of Lainshaw, Mr Kerr of Robertland, Col. S.
M'Alister of Kennox, and Captain Cheape of Girgenti. This last
is built in rather an uncommon style.

some extent, especially in potatoes. The culture of turnip, which
