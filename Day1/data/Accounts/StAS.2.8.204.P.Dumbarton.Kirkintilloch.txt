  The total number of passengers by the canal passage boats from
this station alone in seven months is 13,516, or at the rate of 1932
per month, and 23,170 per annum. There is also a daily coach
to Glasgow from the Washington Inn at nine morning. In 1832,
and for some time before and after, there were five iron steamers
with the paddle-wheels in the stern plying on the canal. Their
names, tonnage, and power of engines were as follows:

  These steamers are now discontinued. It was on this same
sheet of water, in March 1802, that Mr Symington, in a large ves-
sel with a steam engine of more than twenty horse power, passed over.
a distance of nineteen miles in six hours, the steamer dragging two
loaded vessels after her, and having lord Dundas, and Mr Speirs
of Elderslie on board. It was here also that Mr Symington ibi-
tiated the American Fulton in the mysteries of steam navigation,
two years before he sailed for America to carry his projects into
effect.
  Gas-Work.-A gas-work has lately been erected for the purpose
of supplying the town with gas. The whole is to cost L. 1600 at L. 3
a share, of which 1000 shares are sold; L. 2 a share is only re-
quired. The mason-work cost L.421, the carpenter-work L. 88.
The roof is of iron. The main stalk is square, and 50 feet high.
The tanks or cylinders are 28 feet diameter, and 101/2 feet from
the top of the cap to the spring of the foundation. There are 6
retorts; the main pipe is 4 inches diameter.

<FOOTNOTE>The inhabitants of Kirkintilloch, with the neighbouring parishes of Cadder,
Cumbernauld, and Kilsyth, participated largely in the well-known revival of religion
which took place at Cambuslang and various other parts in Scotland inl 742. The first
appearance of the impressions which were afterwards so largely vouchsafed to many
individuals in this district, are recorded by Mr Robe, then minister of Kilayth, and
also by Mr McLaren, the minister of this parish. They are so very remarkable that
they are worthy of being here held up to their "succeeding race." where political re-
ligion too much predominates over the vital and spiritual godliness which actuated
