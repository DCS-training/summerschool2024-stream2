session records exist. But they have been very irregularly kept ever
since then; entries (anything but voluminous,) being made only
occasionally, and at intervals of sometimes two and three years.
They have beep regularly kept only since the induction of the
present incumbent in 1821. There is no register of deaths or
burials. The lay members of session are six in number, all regu-
larly ordained as elders; and the parochial schoolmaster is at pre-

Norwegians; but, as Dr Macculloch remarks, "it is indifferent
