ing, people have been employed at a great expence from the
east country.  These people, having no permanent place of
residence on the west coast, are in general exposed to so
much fatigue and danger on their journey over land, or in
their passage round, through the Pentland Firth, and are lia-
ble to so many inconveniences, on their arrival, for want of
proper lodgings, and other accommodations, that their exer-
tions must be languid, and of course their success precarious.
This being the case, it is no wonder, that adventurers in the
white fishing, after being at considerable expence and trouble,
should drop the plan as totally impracticable.  Now, were
the canal opened, all these obstacles might be removed.
Large vessels, with every conveniency along with them,
might be fitted out from Cromarty, Inverness, and other
towns in the Moray Firth, which, in the course of a few
days, might sail to the fishing grounds, where they could
choose safe harbours in the neighbourhood of the best banks.
Besides the advantage of having all their necessaries on board,
the prospect of returning soon to their families and friends
would double their industry and exertions.  In this way, the
white fishing would soon become successful: and the natives
off the Western Isles, by their intercourse with the east coun-
try people, would acquire the knowledge of it in a short
time, and be able to co-operate with their instructions in
bringing, it to such perfection, and carrying it on to such an
extent, as to become a considerable object in the commerce
of the kingdom.
   By means of this canal, the salmon fishings on the west
coast could also be improved, and have ready access to the
London market.  Thus they would become very valuable to
the proprietors; though hitherto they have almost all been lit-
tle attended to, except that of Lochy, near Fortwilliam, where
