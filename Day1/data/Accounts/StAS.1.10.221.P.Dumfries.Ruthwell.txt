   Villages and Roads.-Ruthwell, in which a privilege of
holding markers and fairs was given by the old charters
the family of Cockpool, is the only village in the parish.  It
is a long straggling place, through which the high road from
Dumfries to Annan passed, before the military road was
made.  The houses were formerly all built of clay; but
these have lately been pulled down, and the whole rebuilt at
the expence of Lord Stormont with stone and slates; the
street has also been enlarged, and laid out in a straight line.-
The high road from Portpatrick to England, made by the mi-
litary at the expence of government, runs through this pa-
rish from E. to W. And, in consequence of an act of Par-
liament lately passed, another road was last year made to the
northward, and running almost parallel to the military road,
which shortens the distance between Annan and Dumfries
something more than a mile.  Tolls are now levied upon
both roads.

   Manufactures, Fisheries, etc.-No species of manufacture
in the linen or woolen branches are carried on in this parish;
but, in the summer season, the people upon the sea coast em-
ploy themselves in making a kind of coarse salt, which an-
swers the common uses tolerably well.  They practice the fol-
lowing method: When the tides have risen very highs and
covered the sands for three or four days, a white crust is left
upon the sand, from which all the fresh water particles
are exhaled by the heat of the sun during the neap tides, and
the remanent substance appears to the eye like pounded crys-
tal.  This crust is pared off by a machine formed like a rol-
ler, only the moveable part of the roller is here immoveable,
and has projecting from it, about half an inch longitudinally,
a piece of thin iron, which scrapes up the crust into heaps,
together with a portion of the sand.  The whole is carried off
