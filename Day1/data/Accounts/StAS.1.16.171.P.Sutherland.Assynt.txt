a certain distance from its source it falls into Auld-a-chro-
kan; this burn, after several windings, disgorges itself into
a great lake called Loch-me-addy; from the spring of
Glaik-na-crev-shellich to this last loch, the course of the
march is from S. to N. From Loch-me-addy the march
assumes a direction from E. to W. in this manner: A great
body of water issues from that loch; it forms a channel of
no great length; it is contracted to the breadth of an ordi-
nary river, and resigns at last its great stream to another
equally large lake called Fane-loch; betwixt these two
great lochs there is in the channel above mentioned one ford,
it is called U-y-farn*; it is dangerous, being only incohe-
rent stone and sand heaped together, by strong winds which
prevail here the go of harvest, more or less through winter,
and especially beginning of spring; some persons, though but
seldom, are drowned at U-y-farn.  At the distance of 3
miles, towards the shore, a grand cascade commands atten-
tion.  It goes by the name of The Cascade of Inverkirkag
River.  The collection of the numberless springs, burns,
and lochs from Ballach Kenich, all along the march, to
Knochan of Assint, as above mentioned, besides what is
superadded from lofty mountains+ on both sides the watery
march, at this very place all concentring to the Cascade,
force their way over a very great, high, and craggy pre-
cipice.  The fall exhibits a scene that strikes the beholder
with surprise; immediately after the fall an easy declin-
ing channel forms; its length to the sea is two miles.

   +These are Su-il-vine, (which means the Mountain of the Fye), in
sea charts called, Sugar Loaf, as being of a conical figure, and seen of that
shape by manners at a great distance; it is in this parish.  The other
great mountain is Cin il-more of Corgach; both are opposite on each
side of the march
