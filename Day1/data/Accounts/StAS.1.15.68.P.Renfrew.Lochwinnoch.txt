set of offices.

   School.-The school, which is situated in the village, is com-
modious, and the salary of old amounted to 200 merks; but
as the parish is divided by the lake, the proprietor on the
south side wished to have a school in that district, and ob-
tained 50 merks.  The people erected a school-house at their
own expence, and the emoluments of the teacher employed
by them are about 17 L. Sterling yearly: the salary and emolu-
ments of the parish schoolmaster amount to about 30 L. an-
nually.

   Poor.-The number of poor on the parish roll is at pre-
sent 20, and they receive from 1 s. 6 d. to 4 s. each, per week.

in the lake, about 5 feet below the surface, which evidently prove the large
forests that must have formerly existed, in this part of the country, as they
have been formed in a rude manner, like the Indian canoes, our of single trees.
About 60 years ago, a ladle of Corinthian brass was found within a mile of
the village, and the handle still remains entire, at the end of which there is
a beautiful ram's head.  It is in the possession of Mr Barclay, inn-keeper at
Lochwinnoch.
