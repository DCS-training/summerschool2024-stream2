in thatching houses.  Thatching with it wastes the supply
of provender which they have for their cattle.  Flax is a
more durable material for this purpose, when properly ap-
plied to the roof, and ultimately less expensive.  The Sta-
tistical Account of Kilmarnock, published in this work, con-
tains some useful information on this point.  3.  The trifling
service to which the tenants are bound, and the casualties
they pay in kind, should, at their option, be commutable
into money.  The proposal for this commutation proceeds
on a principle which ought never to be forgotten or depart-
ed from, viz. that every tenant should posses the constant
and the unsettered command of his time, labour, and
stock.
   The distinction of outfield and infield should be abolished.
The following plan promises to effect this abolition speedi-
ly, and not only without loss during the time of executing
it, but with great gain afterwards.  Let the infield be em-
ployed solely in raising green horse-hoed crops, and let the
manures made on the farm, or purchased, be applied to the
outfield.  On the latter, as it is in general overrun with an-
nual weeds, and in bad tilth, the farmer should begin his
train of culture by summer-fallowing.  This summer-fallow
he should lime.  Then, in succeeding years, let him adopt
this course of crops:  1.  Oats; 2.  Pease, or potatoes, or tur-
nip, which must be horse-hoed; 3.  Barley and grass seeds;
4.  Hay; 5.  (And if possible 6.), Pasture.  In this course
there is no expensive outlay, and the loss of one crop, on
such proportion as in any one year may be fallowed, will
be amply compensated by the meliorating influence the fal-
low produces, not on the first crop only which succeeds it,
but on several crops to come.  A Swedish gentleman, of
great agricultural experience and skill told the compiler of
this paper, that after many trials respecting the most bene-
