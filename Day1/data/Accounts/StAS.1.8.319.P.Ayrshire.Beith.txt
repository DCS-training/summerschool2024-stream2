of January last, in the parish of Auchinleck, at the very ad-
vanced age of 123 years.  According to his own account
he was born at the farm of Willieyards, but left the parish
when young, and inlisted in the army.  He served as a pri-
vate soldier, at the taking of Gibraltar by the British in
1704.  His name is not to be found in our register; but it is
known, that there was a family of the name of Tait, at Wil-
lieyards, more than a century ago, and some of their relations
still live in the parish.

   Trade and Manufactures.-About the time of the union
of the two kingdoms, a trade in linen cloth was introdu-
ced into this place, which became so considerable, that the
Beith markets were frequented by merchants from the neigh-
bouring towns every week.  Many houses, soon after this,
were built on the old glebe, upon tack rights granted by the
minister for half a merk Scotch, of rent per fall; and, when
the Glebe was afterwards exchanged, the Ear1 of Eglintoun
became bound to grant seu rights to the holders of there tack
rights, upon equitable conditions, particularly specified.  About
the year 1730, the linen business, which had greatly declined,
was succeeded by a considerable trade in linen yarn.  The
Beith merchants purchased the yarn made in the country
around, and sold it to the Paisley and Glasgow manufacturers.
This trade, when carried to its greatest extent, about the
year 1760, is supposed to have amounted to 16000 L. Sterling
yearly; and though it has long been upon the decline, linen
yarn is still a considerable article of merchandise.  The de-
mand for this commodity encouraged the farmers to raise
great quantities of flax.  About 60 hhds. of flax feed were sold
in this town annually.  From 1777 to 1789, the manufacture
of silk gauze was carried on to a great extent in this place,
