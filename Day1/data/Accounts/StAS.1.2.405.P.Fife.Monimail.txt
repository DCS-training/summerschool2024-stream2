window, and buried, under night, at the extremity of the
parish.  A proof at once at the sorce of old superstitious cus-
toms, and, at the same times, of the horror so natural to be felt
of such an occasion.

   Poor.-The funds, for the support of the poor, arise from
legacies, mort-cloths, marriages, occasional donations, but
chiefly from the weekly collections at the church doors.  There
are 10 or 12 regular montly pensioners.  On emergencies,
others are assisted.  No begging is allowed.  The distribu-
tions, commumbus annis, are betwixt L. 20 and L. 30 ster-
ling.-In 1782, and 1783, the ordinary funds, with a volun-
tary and unsolicited donation from the heritors, according to
their valued rents, supplied the great exigencies of the poor,
during these two unfortunate seasons.

   Schools.-The established school-master's salary, and perqui-
sites, as precentor and session-clerk, with the school-fees, have
been reckoned to be worth about L. 14.  The number of scholars
varies, according to the abilities and reputation of the teacher;
and those of the private teachers in the parish, 30 may be the av-
erage.  The fees are, English 1 s per quarter; writing 2 s; arith-
metic 2 s; book-keeping 10 s 6 d a course; Latin 2 s 6 d per quar-
ter.  It is not doubted but this, and similar reports, will evince
the necessity of more encouragement to this useful and labo-
rious order of men.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Peats and wood are used,
but in small quantities.  Coals chiefly from Balgonie and Bal-
birnie, in the parish of Markinck, at 7 d per load, of 18 stone,
are the fuel of the parish.  A double cart carries five loads:
the carriage costs nearly the purchase in money.-Servi
