ance which they regularly receive in their old age, and
which is generally extended to their widows.  From the
daily intercourse with Edinburgh, the prices of all kinds of
provisions are regulated by those in the market of the me-
tropolis, and are very nearly the same with them.

   Population.-The return from Abercorn to Dr Webster,
in the year 1755, was 1037 souls.  In the year 1792, a list,
completely accurate, was made up, in the course of parochial
duty, by the writer of this account, and with a view to it,
when the number was 870; and he has no reason to think
there is any considerable alteration since that time.  There
has, therefore, been a decrease of 167 in the course of the
last 40 years.  The register of baptisms begins so far back
as the 1st of November 1585, and, though not complete,
has been kept with tolerable regularity since that time.
From 1586 to 1592, both inclusive, the annual average is
25.  The average of ten years has been taken at many
different periods, and is found to have been highest towards
the end of the last century, being then nearly 39.  Since that
time it has gradually decreased; so that the average of the
last ten years wants a fraction of 20.  Judging, therefore,
from the evidence which the register of baptisms affords,
the population of the parish gradually increased till toward,
the end of the last century, being then above 1600; since
which it has decreased nearly one half.  There is no regi-
ster of deaths before the beginning of the present century.
The following table exhibits several facts with respect to
the sex, age, etc. of the inhabitants in the year 1792.
