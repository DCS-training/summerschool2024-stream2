xl                        Appendix.

   The names of the authors will not be inserted, if that omission is de-
sired; and no information is wished for, that can give uneasiness to any in-
dividual.
   It may not be improper for every Clergyman, who receives this letter,
to acknowledge the receipt of it, suggesting any hints, at the same time,
that may occur to him respecting the Statistical Inquiry; and, particularly,
as to the best mode of supplying any deficiency in the accounts, either by
an application to any of the residing Heritors, to some neighbouring Clergy-
man, or to any other individual, who has spirit and capacity, to do justice
to such an undertaking.
   Any important facts or observations transmitted by the Clergy, which
may not be included in the Statistical Account of Scotland, as now pub-
lished, (to present the Work swelling to too great a size), are to be care-
fully written out in several interleaved copies of the work, to be deposited
in the principal public libraries both of England and Scotland, for the pur-
pose of preservation, and as a foundation for county or provincial his-
tories, in which more minute information may be expected.
   It might be the means of shortening such accounts considerably, if the
information, respecting certain articles, were condensed as much as possible,
in the shape of a Table, according to the annexed specimen.
