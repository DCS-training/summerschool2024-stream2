                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
     Name.-THE parishes of Monivaird and Strowan were origin-
ally distinct, but have been united for about two centuries. "The
modern name, Monivaird, is a corruption of the ancient, which
was Moivard, as appears from a grant made by the Earl of Strath-
erne, in the beginning of the thirteenth century, of the church of
Saint Servanus, or Serf of Moivard, to the monastery of Inchaf-
frey." It is derived from the Gaelic words moi-vard or mon-vard,
signifying the hill of the bards. The pronunciation, Moivard, is
still retained by those inhabitants of the parish who use the Gae-
lic language. *

<FOOTNOTE>In the former Statistical Account, the word Moivard is interpreted as signifying
"the plain of the bards;" but "hill of the bards" agrees more closely with the Gae-
lic and the nature of the locality.
