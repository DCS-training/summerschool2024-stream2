   Crop 1790.-The proportions of the different kinds of
grain sown, and roots and grass, with their probable produce,
and the manner in which they are disposed, are these:
   362 Acres in oats, may be computed to have produced 5
bolls the acre, the produce, or an equivalent, and much more
being consumed by the people.
   169 Acres in bear, may have produced 7 bolls the acre,
of which a part is made into meal for use, and one half may
be sold to the breweries and distilleries.
   18 Acres in pease, may have produced 4 bolls the acre,
partly consumed, and partly sold.
   54 Acres in potatoes, yielded about 30 bolls the acre, 512
pounds Amsterdam in the boll, a large share of which is con-
sumed within the parish, and 600 or 700 bolls are carried to
Aberdeen market, or exported.
   70 Acres in turnip and in rye grass, and red and white
clover.
   114 Acres, part of which is cut for hay, produced food,
with the pasture, and various fodder, for 46 working oxen,
230 cows, and the young cattle; the milk of the cows being
used in families, employed for rearing calves for breed or
sale, and sold in the riffling villages, or without the parish.
Few cattle are fed for market.  The hill-pasture, along with
the cattle, had only 209 sheep, and 12 goats.  From the
crop also was the support of 87 horses, almost all for the
draught.  The ploughs wrought by them and cattle are 33,
the wains 5, and carts and carriages for stones 69.
