PRESBYTERY OF BIGGAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE.

        THE REV. JOHN ALPINE, MINISTER.

        I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

   Name and Boundaries.--The name has at different periods been
written Scrawline, Skirlin, Scarlane, and Skirling; but the origin
of these various designations cannot now be traced with certainty.
The parish is only about two miles and a-half in lenght, the same
in breadth, and approaches nearly to a square.  It is bounded
on th east by Broughton; on the south by Kilbucho and Big-
gar; on the west by Biggar; and on the north by Dolphinton and
Kirkurd.
   The character of its surface is uneven, never rising into any great
elevation, and never spreading out into any wide extent of plain.
The soil is generally fertile; and with a very few spots excepted.
where there is short heather, even those parts which have been un-
disturbed by the industry of man, are covered with lively green.
   Botany.--One rare plant was discovered about two years ago in
this parish, named the Asperula taurina.  It was found by a medical
gentleman in a mouthful of grass plucked by his horse.  It was
examined by several eminent botanists, who expressed much asto-
nishment at its being found in the open fields, and with difficulty
believed that it was not the production of a garden, being found
in this high latitude, and so far from the sea coast; where it grew,
however, no garden had ever been.
                     II.--CIVIL. HISTORY.
   Historical Notices.--Very few facts are known as to the history of
this parish.  The earliest period to which any known record refers
is the reign of King Robert Bruce, who granted to John Monfode
the barony of Scrawline, with the advowson of the church; and in
this family it seems to have continued a considerable time, for we
find that a Margaret Monfode, granted an annuity* of two merks
