     Statistical Account

   The lyar bird is not peculiar to this island, but abounds
far more here than in other places of the country.  The food
of this bird is not known; only by its being web-footed, and
seen always flying and hovering over the sea, there can be no
doubt but that in some shape or other, it derives its subsistence
from that element.  The stomach of the young ones do
not serve to ascertain their food; they contain nothing but
a thin oily substance which flows readily by the bill, when
they are hung by the feet.
   This bird makes its nest, by digging a hole horizontally
in the loose earth, found among the shelvings of high rocks.
The holes are commonly of that width and depth, that a
man's hand and arm can reach the birds, of which there is
only one in each hole.  One of them may weigh nearly a
pound weight, and is so fat, that one half of it will run to an
oil.  Some reckon it the most delicious morsel in the world,
and others the most detestable.
   Whether the lyar, or lyar catcher, be the greatest curiosi-
ty, I shall leave the reader to judge.  The former, as if in-
stinctively warned of the adventurous boldness of the latter,
chuses a retreat for hatching its young, seemingly perfectly
inaccessible to every creature not furnished with wings.
Rocks perpendicular, or sometimes projecting far beyond
their base, and in height from 1000 to 1300 feet, promise
the desired security;-but in vain.  The lyar-catcher swings
himself over by means of a rope, and lowers himself, or is
lowered down by his assistants, who hold the rope, till he
reaches his intended station.  He then crawls, and clings,
and climbs, till he has taken every lyar in that quarter.  In
pursuit of the same game, he sometimes, by a second rope,
makes a second descent still farther down the precipice.  In
this last station, he may have 500 feet perpendicular rock
over his heads and 700 or 800 feet below him, hanging over
