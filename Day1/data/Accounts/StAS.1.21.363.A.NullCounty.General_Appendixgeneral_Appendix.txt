in my report on that subject, to be by a canal through the
carses from Menstry dam, and upon its level to Craigforth
dam, where it must lock down nine feet six inches to com-
municate with the upper Forth; but whereas this canal was
principally intended to facilitate the carriage of coals, and it
has been thought probable that quantities of that commo-
dity would be immediately carried upon it as would corres-
pond to the expence.  It is now proposed to execute only
that part of it which reaches from Menstry dam to Manor,
with the branch to Cambus; to deepen both these ports, and
to make proper conveniencies to tranship the coals; until
experience shall shew which is the best way of completing
the communication, by locking down to the tideway, or by
the canal to Craigforth dam.
   The canal from Menstry dam to Manor being very little
more than the canal from the same place to the Cambus, will
save three miles sailing on the tideway to the boats of the
upper Forth and Stirling shore.  The Cambus branch is ne-
cessary, because by opening an export sale to Devon coallie-
ries, they will be enabled to send a greater quantity of ton-
nage upon the upper parts of the river, and thereby raise
more tolls.
   It is proposed, to use the channel of the Devon, from Men-
stry dam to Sauchie; to lock up these twenty-six feet by four
locks; and to proceed to Meloch foot, or, if need be, to the
Rack mill, by the canal.  At least, two of the four locks at
Sauchie can be cut out of a very good freestone rock, which
will greatly lessen the expence, and is accordingly allowed for
in the estimates.
   The dimensions of the canal are proposed to be sixteen
feet wide at bottom, with four feet water.  The locks thir-
teen feet and a half wide, seventy-two feet long, and of the
fall specified.  The navigation on the Forth may be carried
