parish in any degree of improvement: On these there are 
good houses, offices, and some good enclosures, limed and 
prepared with green crops for grass, which answers well.
Pease grow well in limed fields here.  These farms have 
the advantage of the best climate in the parish.  They 
are ploughed with English or Scotch ploughs, according to 
the ground. Upon these, there are good horses, oxen 
carts, and the other modern implements.  The want of 
hard wood in the country is a drawback; because, without
it, there can be no durable instruments of husbandry. There
are several neat farm-houses built of late through the parish;
but the farms thermselves in general are in no better state than
they were 100 years ago.  The bries, or Higland parts
of the parish, are not subjects for the modern improvements
is husbandry, but they might be much benefited by lining,
the limestone and peats being near their fields in one quarter,
but hitherto that has not been attempted.  The absurd ri-
diculous method of run-ridge still takes place in a great part
of the parish.-The produce of the parish is corn and po-
tatoes; it never maintains its inhabitants, and often, when a 
failure happens in the crop, falls far short; some often
buy meal for 6 months in the year.  After a pretty exact
calculation, it is found, that only about 6 firlots of meal
grow at an average of years, in the two parishes, for each
person in them.  It is shown thus:  There are 7 mills in
these parishes, 2 of them superior to the rest; and, upon
sure information, computed, at an average of years, at 20

The multure here being the 33 d part, gives the whole pro-
duce, except seed and horse corn, namely 2640 bolls.
