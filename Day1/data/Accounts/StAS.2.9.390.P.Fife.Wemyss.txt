the fund adds another 6d., so that the spinner receives 1s. for
her work, while the fund loses 6d. on each spindle.  The sum
earne in this way, by even a good spinner, is very small; but
whatever it may amount to, it is the fruit of labour, and it is prized
as such.
  Fairs.--Two annual fairs are held in the village of Kennoway,
the one in April, and the other in October.  No business has for
a long time been done at them.
 Inns and Alehouses.--There are no less than 13 houses in
the parish licensed to sell spirituous liquors and ales.  If so
many can make profits by such a traffic, there is great reason
to fear, that by far too much money is spent in them, and that an
increase of intemperance must be the result.  The unnecessary
multiplication of such places of resort is much to be depreated;
for, besides affording facilities to those who are already addicted
to drinking,it ssets additional and powerful temptationto the worst
of all vices, in the way of those who are sober and industrious.
 Fuel.--Coal abounds in all the neighbourhood, and after what
has been already said in regard to its being found of good quality,
and wrought in the parish, it is scarcely necessary to add,that
this is the fuel universally used.  At Balgrie colliery, in the pa-
rish, from which the great majority of the inhabitants are supplied,
it is sold at present at 8s. 4d. per ton.
