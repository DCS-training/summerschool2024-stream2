	In this account is not included the value of hill and sheep pas-
ture, and of gardens, which has not been ascertained.
	The value of disposable produce, including grain of all sorts,
potatoes, hay, cattle, pigs, poultry, and dairy produce, has been
estimated at from L.17,1000 to L.18,000. With regard to dairy,
produce, it may be mentioned, that, on a small farm in the parish,
there has been a manufacture of sweet-milk cheeses, to a consi-
derable extent, for a good many years, which originated under the
patronage of James Andrew Sandilands, Esq. of Aberdeen, and
the demand for them, under the name of Canterland cheese, from
various quarters in England and Scotland, is much beyond what
can be supplied.
        Manufactures.-About thirty hand-looms are employed in the
manufacture of coarse linen during winter. In summer the num-
ber is less, several hands being then more profitably engaged in
salmon-fishing.

five and a-half miles from the village of St Cyrus.
