   year round, about 14 hours each day.  On the same water,
other profitable works might be rected.-There is also a
distillery in the neighbourhood of the town, in high repute for
making good whisky.  But however profitable this, and other
works of the same kind, may be, to the manucfacturer, the land-
lord, and the farmer, there can be little doubt of their being
most pernicious to the health, the morals, and the industry of the
people at large.-There are, present 3 large stout boats, with
a small one, that goes at half tide.  They cross every day, when
passengers cast up.  And when once they quays are extended,
as resolved on, there will be passage at all times, wind
and weather serving.-It is also proper to mention, that
about 5 years ago, an ingenious foreign gettleman, in his
researches about this country, discovered in this parish, a fort
of mould, (which appears to the rocks reduced by time to 
earth); of which he afterwards sent to France two ship loads.
He was very tenacious of making any discoveries respecting
its quality.-It is now known, however, that the court of
France prohibited the importation of it.  It is thought this stuff
was used either in the porcelain manufactory, or for making
crucibles.  The ships were loaded from the earth, on the top
of a small hill, immediately to the north of the town.
