426                   ROSS AND CROMARTY.

Acts of Assembly for that year, we find the following mention
made of him, "Reference to the Commission for planting vacant
kirks in the north, anent Mr Hector Fraser, probationer, having
the Irish language, his going to the bounds of the Presbytery of
Ross." After being ten years in Kincardine, Mr Fraser was
transported to the neighbouring parish of Eddertoun, 4th May
1709, where he died on the 17th May 1729.
   8. Mr Robert Munro, brother to Mr Hugh Munro, successively
minister of Tarbat (1699-1701), and Tain (1701-1744). He
had studied at the University of St Andrews, and was licensed to
preach by the presbytery of Tain, Ist December 1708 ; be was
ordained and admitted " minister of Kincarden" on the 29th of
March 1711, by Mr Daniel Macgilligin of kilmuir-Easter. The
Rev. Joseph Munro, minister of Eddertoun from 1742 to 1785,
was his son, and was born in the year 1714. Mr Robert Munro
died, after a ministry of nearly thirty years, on the 10th of February
1741; and was succeeded by
   9.Mr David Ross, nephew to Mr David Ross, minister of Tar-
bat (1707-1748), who was parochial schoolmaster of Nigg and
Tarbat successively; to the latter of which he was appointed in
1732. Having received " an unanimous call from the heritors
and elders of the parish of Kincarden," Mr Ross was ordained and
admitted minister there on the 7th April 1742; but died on the
10th of May following.
   10. Mr Gilbert Robertson.-After studying and taking the usual
degrees at a Scotch University, Mr Robertson became " itinerant
tutor to Sir Robert Munro of Foulis's eldest son," (afterwards Sir
Harry Munro), and went with him to the academy of the cele-
brated Dr Philip Doddridge at Northampton in England, where
he attended the divinity lectures delivered by Dr Doddridge, and
received license and ordination from a class of English dissenters
in that town and neighbourbood, Dr Doddridge being moderator.
On his return home, he resided at Limlair, in the parish of Kiltearn;
and in 1740, received a presbyterial call to the church and parish of
Dingwall, which was, however, rejected by the Commission of As-
sembly, who declared their dissatisfaction with the presbytery, and
appointed the moderator to write them a letter to that effect. His
admission to Kiacardine, which took place 31st August 1742, was
a very harmonious one,-the petition for him having been signed
by the whole parish. After an eminently useful ministry of thirty-
one years, Mr Robertson died on the 17th of March 1774.
   11. Mr Andrew Gallie, who succeeded, was ordained at Nigg.
