tants live in these except 36 families.  Of these families on-
ly three reside in the Ochils.  The houses consist of nothing
but the ground floor, except 8, of which, 5 houses have on-
ly one story raised above the ground floor, two have 2 stories,
and one has three stories, and there are only three houses,

   Manufacturers-Tillicoultry has been long famous for
weaving a course woolen cloth, called Tillicoultry Serge.  It
is a species of shaloon, having worsted warp and yarn wast,
and is reported to have been wrought here, as early as the
reign of MARY Queen of Scots.  The average price is 1 s.
Sterling per yard.  Though the manufacture has now, in a
great measure, left us, and gone to Alva, (like the arts and
sciences, from East to West,) yet all the cloth of this kind is
sold in the markets, under the name of Tillicoutry Serge.  It
is much to be regretted, that more attention is not paid to
this manufacture in the place where is was invented, or at
least brought to the greatest perfection.  About 50 years a-
go, a serge web from Alva would not sell in the market,
while one from Tillicoultry remained unsold.  But this is by
no means the case at present.  The author of this account
can give no precise statement of the quantity of serge
wrought here, as the stamp master keeps no list.  He sup-
poses, however, that he stamps annually 7000 ells of serge,
and an equal quantity of plaiding.  Some of the weavers are
now employed in making muslins, but as this branch is still
in its infancy, it is impossible to say with what advantage it
may be attended.
