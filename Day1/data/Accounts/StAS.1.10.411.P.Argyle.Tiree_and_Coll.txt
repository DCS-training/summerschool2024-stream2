     of Tiry.

   The black cattle of Tiry and part of Coll, which have no
access to pasture in heathy ground, are subject as above to
the murrain, or in Gaelic airneach, probably from its affecting
the kidneys.  It seems to be communicated either from the
milk or fine grass, or from both.  However, when sheep are
banished, the coarse grass inclosed and encouraged to grow,
being the best pasture for calves and young cattle, it becomes
at least such a seasoning as may prevent the above distemper.
When such cattle, deducing the inconveniencies of ferrying,
might most probably sell as high as any in the Highlands.
There are beautiful cattle reared here, especially of late,
which, when sent to English pasture, grow to an amazing
size.  One of them, of which we lately had an account, fed
by Mr Spearman of Northumberland, 1790, weighed in beef,
tallow, and hide, 117 stone 5 1/4 lib.
   Except upon gentlemens farms, who occupy two fifths of
the land, there is not one third more of black cattle than of
horses.  This cannot be effectually rectified by the present
division of the lands and plan of husbandry.

   A few years ago the number of horses was much greater;
orders were given to reduce them in both islands.  A four year
old native horses sells from 2 L. to 5 L.  In Tiry, they might
