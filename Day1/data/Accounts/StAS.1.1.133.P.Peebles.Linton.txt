No oak has occured, except once a large one in a moss near
the top of Mendic Hill.  The sheep prevent the growth of
natural wood.  The young shoots of heath, the year after it
is burnt, is the great food of the sheep.  If burnt in winter
it dies.  The time alloted by the game laws for burning in
spring is too short, as heath is often too wet to burn in the li-
mited time; but sheriffs who know country affairs fine tres-
passing farmers in moderation.  There is a moss plant with
a white cottony head growing in mosses, which is the first
spring food of the sheep.  It springs in February, if the wea-
ther is fresh.  It is commonly called pull ling.  The sheep
take what is above the ground tenderly in their mouths, and
without biting it draw up a long white stalk.

   Grazing.-There may, by a rough computation, be about
10,000 sheep grazed in the parish, 130 horses, and 460 cows.
Swine are coming more and more into fashion, both among
farmers and householders, for family use.  Cows are from
20 to 26 stone weight, yielding from 6 to 8 Scots pints of
milk per day.  They are kept mostly for family use, no at-
tention being paid to dairy farming.  The breed of horses is
much improved of late, particularly since the introduction of
two-horse ploughs, which are generally adopted.  English
ploughs, with the curved moldbroad and corresponding sock,
are coming into more general use, except for breaking up
moor and bent.  Small's plough is also coming into use.  A few
young horses are reared from the plough mares for sale.  Of
late, year olds are sold from L. 6 to L. 10.  The demand is
greatest for the males, which, caeteris paribus, draw from 30
to 40 shillings more than the females.  A good stallion in
the neighbourhood will be bought in at L. 40 or L. 50,
and yield to his master a profit of from L. 15 to L. 20 annu-
ally.
