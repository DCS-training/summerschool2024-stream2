			PARISH OF SOUTH RONALDSAY
                                AND BURRAY.

		  PRESBYTERY OF KIRKWALL, SYNOD OF ORKNEY.

		    THE REV. JOHN GERARD, MINISTER.


		I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	   THIS parish consists of three parishes urfited, time immemorial,
	under one minister, viz. Ist, South or St Mary's parish, compre-
	bending above one-third of the large island of South Ronaldsay,
	and three islands in the Pentland Frith, two of them inhabited,
	Swona, and one of the two Pentland Skerries; 2d, Nortb or St
	Peter's parish, comprehending the rest of this large island of
	South Ronaldsay ; and, 3d, the parish of Burray, which consists
	of the islands of Burray, Hunda, and Glumesbolm. The two
	first are inhabited.
	   Geology.-The highert land in the parish does not exceed 300
	feet above the level of the sea. The general inclination of the
	rocks is to the north-West; but some varieties of that inclination
	are truly striking. On the east side of Stoos-head, where the
	rock is above 200 feet high, the rock is suddenly depressed to
        the south-east about 75&deg;, going down into the German Ocean,
	and, at a few yards distance on the north and south side of this,
	the general depression to north-west prevails, and continues, over
	the whole parish, except a small portion east or Grininess-head;
	and, on the north-west end of Glumesholm, the depression is not
        less than 80&deg;. These sudden variations in the position of the va-
	rious strata, prove clearly that all were laid down by water, and.
	long continued in a soft state. The sudden depressions prove
	that softer materials below gave way to their pressure, and occa-
	sioned this variety of position.  The whole of the islands in the
	parish, are composed of sandstone and dark blue slate or rather flag.
	The sandstone can seldom be quarried in thin pieces; but the flag
	or slate may be raised in slabs from'six to eight feet diameter, at
	Hoxa and Herston.
