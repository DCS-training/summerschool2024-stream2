tirely supported by his munificence.  In what particular year
this frost happened I cannot say; but it was a memorable
year, and fatal to many.  That it happened in his own
and his father's day, appears not only from the circumstance
above mentioned, but also from a paragraph of a letter

     And on the sheaf with vengeance lay.
     The floor, at night, swept clean and well,
     Can scarce produce a scanty meal.
