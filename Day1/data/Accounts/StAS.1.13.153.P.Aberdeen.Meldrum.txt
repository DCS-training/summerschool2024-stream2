     (COUNTY AND SYNOD OF ABERDEEN, PRESBYTERY OF

     Name, Extent, Air, Soil, etc.

   The ancient name of this parish was Bethelny; the
church and manse being at that time situated in a part
of the parish, which retains that name, and where there is
still a church-yard, and burial place for the family of Mel-
drum.  The present church was built near to the village
of Old-Meldrum, with a view (it is said) to annex the
parish of Bourty to the parish of Meldrum, for so it has
been called since this church was built, about the year 1684;
but this annexation did not take place.  The figure of the
parish is irregular, measuring about 5 English miles in
length, from S. to N. along the post-road from Aberdeen
to Banff, which passing through the town of Old Meldrum,
divides the parish into two. but not equal parts.  The
breadth from E. to W. is in some places, more than 4
