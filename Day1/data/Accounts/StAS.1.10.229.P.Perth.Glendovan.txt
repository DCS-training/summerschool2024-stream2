     NUMBER XVIII.

     PARISH OF GLENDOVAN.

     (Presbytery of Auchterarder.-Synod of Perth and Stir-
     ling.-County of Perth.)

     By the Reverend Mr JOHN BROWN.

     Name, Extent, etc.

   THE parish of Glendovan affords but few materials for
the researches of the curious.  It derives its name
from the Water of Dovan, which runs through it in a direc-
tion nearly from W. to E. through a narrow glen, scarcely
in any place extending to the width of two furlongs, and, in
many places, the hills rise immediately from the banks of
this stream.  The windings of the river, the trees with which
it is skirted in many places, and plantations now far advanc-
ed, for which the soil seems particularly adapted, together
with the verdure of the adjacent hills, afford a most delight-
ful prospect.
   The parish of Glendovan is situated in the middle of the
Ochill hills, (the great strath called Strathern lying betwixt
it and the Grampian Hills; on the N. a fine corn country;
on the S. the low grounds of Perthshire and Clackmannan
to the Frith of Forth.) extending in length from S. W. to
N. E. 6 English miles, and in breadth 4 1/2.  It is a hilly dis-
trict, but the hills are green and smooth, seldom incumber-
ed by rocks, and only a few spots are covered with heath.
