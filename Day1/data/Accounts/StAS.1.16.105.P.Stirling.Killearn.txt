which George's ancestors descended.  The place is called
the Moss, because it is situated in the vicinity of a peat-
moss, which is part of the farm.  The dwelling-houses con-
sidered as a building, is very far from being conspicuous;
although it is no worse, and probably never was worse than
the ordinary farm-houses in this part of the country.  Its
appearance of meanness arises from its being very low, and
covered with straw thatch.  Part of it, however, has been
rebuilt, since the year 1506, when George was born.  Mr
Finlay is highly to be commended for preserving, as much
as possible, the ancient construction and appearance of this

edifice would sink into oblivion, when compared with the
humble birth-place of George Buchanan.  Long may the
Moss of Killearn afford mankind a striking proof that the
GENIUS of learning does not always prefer the lofty abodes
of the great and powerful.  It must, however, be remarked,
that the parents of Buchanan, although not very opulent,
yet were not in abject or indigent circumstances.  The
farm, which consists of a plough of land, was able, by the
aid of industry and oconomy, to keep them easy.  A place
in the neighbourhood is, to this day, called Herlot's Shiels,
so denominated from Buchanan's mother, whose name was
Agnes Heriot, and who first used that place for the shield-

which was for a long time in great repute, and much fre-

uncle George Heriot, after whom he was named, went to
Dumbarton, Paris, etc. etc. to complete his studies.  A
considerable number of old trees yet remain adjacent to
the house; and are reported to have been planted by
George when a boy.  A mountain ash, famous for its age
