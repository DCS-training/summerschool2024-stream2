and book-keeping, 5s.; Latin and mensuration, each 5s.; school-
master's salary, the maximum, L. 33; average number of scholars
at parish school, 100. Fees actually paid to the teacher may be
from L. 40 to L. 50 annually.
	The private schools may be attended by about 100. There
are several Sabbath schools, having about 200 scholars from seven
to fourteen years of age.
	Library.--There is one circulating library, which was instituted
about nine years ago, and consists of upwards of 700 volumes of
useful knowledge. There is, also, a small library of about 300 vo-
lumes, entirely religious, for the benefit of a catechumen's class,
taught by the minister on the Sabbath evenings.
	Poor.--The average number of persons receiving parochial
aid, during the last two years, was 12. Two received per month
5s.; four, 4s.; three, 6s.; one, 16s.; one, 8s. 6d.; one, 3s.
	The whole of the above expenditure is defrayed by the collec-
tions at the church doors, which amount on an average to L. 36
annually, by the receipts from mortcloths, and by the interest
of L. 100 at 5 per cent, bequeathed to the poor by a native of
the parish. The poor of the parish in general manifest a land-
able anxiety to make every effort for their own maintenance. It
is seldom that any application is made for relief from the poor's
funds, except in cases of real destitution.
	Fairs.--There is a fair held annually in the parish, on the Thurs-
day preceding Whitsunday; at which a considerable number of
cattle are exposed to sale.
	Ale-houses.--There are 14 ale-houses at present in the parish.
