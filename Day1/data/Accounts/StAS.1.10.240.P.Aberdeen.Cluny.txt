     Statistical Account

with the dung of their cattle and dry earth, makes a very
good compost, with which they manure their bear land.
When this is the case, along with their bear seed they
sow red and white clovers rye, and rib grass, which next
year, and perhaps for two years, they cut for hay; the third
year, and sometimes for the fourth and fifth, they pasture
this field.  When it is taken again into tillage, they take a
crop or two off oats, then a crop of turnip, after that bear and
grass seeds, and then a crop or two of hay, after that pasture
for one or more years; and, in the same manner, they man-
age the rest of their infield.  But this can only be said of
those few who bring lime from Aberdeen; the rest, who are
by far the greatest number, go on in the old wretched man-
ner formerly described.

   Fuel.-The only fuel made use of here is peas and turf,
and these, in the greater part of the parish, are very scarce
and even difficult to be found, the peas mosses being much
exhausted, and some of them totally at an end.  There is,
indeed on the top and W. side of the forest of Corrainy,
abundance of moss, but that hill being very high and steep
on the E. side next to Cluny, and the moss on the W. side
at the distance of several miles, it is almost impossible to pro-
cure firing from this place, especially for crofters and subte-
nants, who frequently have no horses or carts of their own.
The only resource therefore, is coal from Aberdeen, with
which the people here could supply themselves with toler-
able facility, if the price were moderate, which it would be
if the tax on coals was taken off*.

*This was written before the late most wife and politic re-
peal of the coal tax, for which the country is so much indebted
to the present patriotic Secretary of State Mr Dundas.
