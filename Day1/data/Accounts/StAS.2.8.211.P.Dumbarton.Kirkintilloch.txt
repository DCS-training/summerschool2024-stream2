			KILMARONOCK.                          211

   The town of Kirkintilloch lies 49 miles west of Edinburgh, 20
south-west of Stirling, 16 east of Dumbarton, 7 north of Glasgow,
5 south-west of Kilsyth, and 3 south-east of Campsie. The pa-
rish is destined to receive an additional advantage from the Edin-
burgh and Glasgow Railway, which is to pass throughout its whole
length. It begins in the west near Pinkerton-hill, runs north by
Coulstone, Bishopriggs, Corshill, Miremailing, Claddens, Cadder-
moss, Lochside distillery, and Mountain-moss, and enters Kirkin-
tilloch passing Garngebber, near which it crosses the Monkland
and Kirkintilloch railway, passes on by Warnflat, crosses Luggie
water west of Drumbreck, and runs on by Mosside, Drumgrew,
and Easterboard, where it leaves the parish, and enters Cumber-
nauld.

   June 1839.
