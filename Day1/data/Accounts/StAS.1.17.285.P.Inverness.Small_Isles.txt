the last 5 years, from 15 s. to 20 s. each boll of 8 stone
weight; the country meal, both oat and barley, from 14 s.
to 20 s. the boll, containing 20 pecks, and each peck about
5 1/4 Scotch pints.  Potatoes sell between 2 s. to 3 s. the bar-
rel.  There is little or no beef or mutton sold by the weight,
excepting in Canna, to seafaring people, who purchase it
from 2 d. to 3 d. the lb.  Butter sells from 12 s. to 14 s. and
cheese about 5 s. the stont of 22 English pounds.
   A labourer is hired at 1 s. a day, if he maintains himself,
or 6 d. per day with victuals; carpenters from 8 d. to 1 s.
with victuals; masons, about 2 s. without victuals; shoema-
kers, at 8 d. with victuals.  Taylors are generally paid by the
piece work.  In a situation like this, it is difficult to ascer-
tain the expence of a married common labourer in husban-
dry.  The terms allowed them have no fixed standard.  Ma-
ny of them have one fourth of the crop they make with the
plough, being generally barley and oats, and a third of the
crop they make with the spade, and manure with sea-ware,
which is principally potatoes, and grazing for two cows with
their followers.  This must afford them but a scanty subsis-
tence, especially in years of scarcity, when they have a nu-
merous family of weak children; but, with the aid derived
from the shore, they are enabled to live.  These are simply
the wages of the man's personal labour, his wife giving no
assistance, except a few weeks in harvest, to reap the crop.
Single male servants in husbandry receive about 3 L. in mo-
ney, what they wear of shoes, other perquisites, and their
victuals.  Other male domestic servants arc allowed from 2 L.
to 3 L. a year, with shoes and perquisites.  Female domestic
servants receive from 12 s. to 20 s. with shoes and several
other perquisites.  The average price of horses may be about
3 L. 10 s.; horned cattles about 3 L.; sheep, about 4 s.
