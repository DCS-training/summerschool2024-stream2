scends, and is received into a subterraneous lake, that extends
backwards to a length that has not been ascertained.  Tra-
dition says, that the only person who ever had courage to at-

that the extinction of the lights, by soul air, obliged him to

empties itself into the Bay of Durness, and the Hope, afford
salmon, like other British rivers communicating with the sea.
These, with all the other fishings in Lord Reay's country,
are under lease to a company, who export the fish caught.
The former river yield about 24 barrels of salmon annually.
The Hope may afford 20 barrels.  Cod, ling, skate, turbor,
haddocks, whitings, and flounders, are the most common sea
fish upon these coasts.  Loch Erriboll sometimes affords a small
tack of herrings.  Seals abound all around the coast.  When
the tide is at ebb, scores of them are daily to be seen, bask-
ing upon the banks of the channel.  As they seldom go out
