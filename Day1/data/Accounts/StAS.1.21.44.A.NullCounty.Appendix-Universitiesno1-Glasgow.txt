students; as also by requiring that a certain attendance shall
be given, in those seminaries, by such as obtain academical
degrees, accompanied with various exclusive privileges.
   It has of late been remarked, that such institutions and regu-
lations, though intended to promote the interest of those in-
corporated societies, have proved, in some degree, hurtful to
them, by forcing an attendance from a greater number of stu-
dents, and consequently tending to supersede the industry and
abilities of the respective teachers.  But the number of this de-
scription of students, commonly called bursars, at the Univer-

fessor's income; and, it must not be overlooked, that the

carelessness in the performance.  One good effect of it is ob-
vious.  Several of these bursaries are in the gift of the Col-
lege; so that the Principal and Professors have it in their
power to bestow them upon students of superior genius and
industry, but who have not the means of prosecuting their
studies.-The character of a bursar does not, in the Univer-
sity of Glasgow, carry with it any external marks of servility,
or degradation of any kind.  Several names might be here
mentioned, that would do great honour to the University,
who were supported, during the course of their studies, by
funds appropriated for that purpose.
   The foundation by Mr. SNELL deserves particularly to be
mentioned, as perhaps one of the largest and most liberal in
Britain.  That gentleman, in the year 1688, bequeathed a
considerable estate in Warwickshire for the support of Scotch
students at BALIOL COLLEGE, OXFORD, who had studied for
some years at the University of Glasgow.  By the rise in the
