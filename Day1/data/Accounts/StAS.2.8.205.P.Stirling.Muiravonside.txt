        1.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name.--THE name is commonly pronounced and generally
written in ancient records, Moranside, and is derived, doubtless;
from the position of the parish on the river Avon, and its un-
cultivated aspect in former times. Our silver communion cups,
however, probably presented to the parish by the Earl of Cal-
lendar, and Lord of Almond, are said, in 1676, to belong to
the Church of Almond: this, together with a tradition, that the
minister once lived at Almond Castle, which is not far from the
church, makes it probable that the chaplain of the castle, having
assumed the spiritual superintendence of the district, got it erect-
ed into a separate parish, as it is repeatedly mentioned among the
patronages of the Earls of Callendar and Linlithgow, as ancient-
ly forming part of the parish of Falkirk.
