ges.of which now remain, that the murder of Lady Macduff and
her children by order of Macbeth took place; which event forms so
prominent an incident in Shakspeare's tragedy. Farther west is Blair
Castle, a handsome modern house; the old house of the same name
which was removed when the present one was erected, is said to
have been built by hamilton, Archbishop of St Andrews, about
the time of the ReformatiOD.  In the east part of the parish, stands
Valleyfield House, the seat of the Prdston family, a handsome
and commodious dwelling, surrounded with beautiful grounds.
   No noble family resides in the parish.
   Land-owners.-There are nine proprietors in the parish, (in-
cluding properties under the management of trustees) whose pro-
perties vary in value from L. 150 to about L. 2000 a year.
   Parochial Registers.-The earliest date of the session  records
is the year 1646; they seem full and accurately kept from that
year to 1662.  There is a blank from that time till the year
1676. Thence until the year 1684, they are again full.  There
is again a blank from that year to the year 1700; and from that
period they continue without interruption to the present time.

   The population of the parish is not known previous to the year
1755, when it amounted to 1695; in 1791, it was 1442; and by
the census in 1831, it was 1484.  A very considerable decrease,
which took place from 1755 to 1791, is stated in the former Ac-
count to have arisen from the improved system of agriculture and
husbandry then introduced, by which as much work was accom-
plished by one man, as formerly by three or four; and from the
throwing of several small farms into one large, by which fewer hands
came to be employed.  Another great reason is stated to have been
the loss or failure of several branches of trade and manufacture,
which formerly employed from forty to fifty hands: something also
must be imputed to the flourishing state of trade in Dunfermline and
Glasgow, and to the carrying on of the numerous public buildings
in Edinburgh, by which all the surplus hands were drained off.
