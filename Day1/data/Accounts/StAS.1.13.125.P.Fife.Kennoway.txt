is one of the disadvantages under which this, and some of
the neighbouring parishes labour.  There are appearances
of coal in several parts.  Some of it was lately wrought; but
as the quality was not very good, nor the seam thick, and
as there is great plenty of excellent coal in several of the
neighbouring parishes, the mines that had been opened,

that the only fuel used in the parish is coal, and that the
great plenty of this most necessary article, with which the
neighbourhood abounds, is one of those advantages which
it enjoys in common with all the S. coast of Fife.

   Population, etc.-According to Dr Webster's report, the
population then was 1240.  The number of the people and
houses, seems to have been nearly the same for centuries.
In 1785, the whole inhabitants of the parish, (of whom the
village contains about one half), amounted, from the age of
going to school, to 1200, of whom 800 atttended the Esta-

not a single person of another persuasion in the parish.  All
the houses are inhabited, none are allowed to go to ruin,
and very few are known to have been built on a new
foundation.  About 20 years ago, and for some time be-

considerable malting business was formerly carried on in it;
the great road, too, between the ferries of Dundee and
Kinghorn, passed through it; but about 40 years ago, that
business failed, and the road was carried 3 miles to the
westward.  In consequence of these events, the malt and
brew steadings, which amounted to 15 or 16 in the village,
