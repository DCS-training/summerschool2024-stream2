   Birds.-There are all sorts of common fowls, such as hens,
turkeys, geese, ducks, etc. reared in this parish, and it a-

of April, and the swallow in the beginning of May.  The
lapwing or green plover in March, and the wood-cock in Oc-

the frost is intense.  There are a few singing bird also in
this parish, such as the thrush, blackbird, linnets, goldfinches
in great abundance, the bullfinch, which, I am told, has made
his appearance in this country about 20 years ago, and a great
plenty of larks.

it is very large and reaches far into the rock, so far indeed
that the farmers in the neighbourhood were obliged to shut it
it up toward the hill with rubbish; for, when their sheep and
goats strayed into it, they were never again seen nor heard of.
The mouth of the cave was made up with stone and lime se-

goods in it; but since that contraband trade has been abolish-
