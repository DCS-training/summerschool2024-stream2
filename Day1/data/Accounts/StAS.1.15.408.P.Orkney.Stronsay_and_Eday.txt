advantage than they can possibly do when jumbled together, as they have
been in this district, for time immemorial; here it is not uncommon to fee a
man one day acting the part of a tradesman; another, that of a fisher; a
third, that of a kelp maker; who, having found all there employments insuf-
ficient for the support of himself and family, must apply also to the tillage of
the ground, in order to furnish (after all,) a scanty substance for him and
them.  The truth of the proverb, in such case, is manifest; "Jock of all
trades, good at none!"
   It is moreover submitted, with all due deference, that the following in-

   1st, That one or more skilful farmers should be induced to come from well

   2dly That a spirit of emulation should be raised among the heritors of dif-

plan, or any other plan better calculated for promoting the public interest.
   3dly, That heritors and tenants of each district, in collective bodies, should
respectively excite a spirit of emulation among their dependants by annual
premiums.  And, 4thly, As this would infallibly increase greatly the national
wealth and importance, that a certain sum, or number of medals, should be
advanced to the heritors or tenants of such districts as exhibited proofs of
great exertions in this way, to be by them distributed to the individuals un-
