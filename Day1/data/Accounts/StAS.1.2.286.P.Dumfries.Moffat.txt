     Statistical Account

   Moffat is distant from Dumfries 21 miles; from Annan 27;
and these are the nearest sea-ports.

   Rivers.-There are three rivers, which run through the pa-
rish, to wit, Evan on the west, Moffat on the east, and Annan
in the middle.  These three rivers join near the southern
boundary of the district; and the united streams bear the name
of Annan thence to the Solway firth.

   Soil.-Upon the banks of the Annan, and the Moffat, there
is a good deal of meadow and arable land.  The soil is a mix-

rising towards the hills, the other arable lands are of a light
dry gravelly soil, in most places tolerably deep; and with
lime, which the farmers begin to use, producing excellent
crops of oats.  There is very little wheat or barley sown.
But there are large crops of excellent potatoes.  Turnip and
clover also are very successfully cultivated.  Lime is brought
near 30 miles.
   The extent of arable land is not known, having never been
measured.  It is guessed at about 3000 acres: about 300 of these
are supposed to be in crop, besides meadows.  The land, in
general, is very mountainous.

supplied from the lower parts of the country.  It is thought,
however, that whole grain produced in the parish, would
not do more than supply the inns in the village.

   Air.-The climate is thought remarkably healthy.  Though
the rains are frequent, and sometimes heavy, yet in general,
the air is wonderfully pure and dry.  Every opening of the
