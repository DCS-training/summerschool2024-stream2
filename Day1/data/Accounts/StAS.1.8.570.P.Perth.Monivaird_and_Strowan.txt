with regard to situation and soil, it will appear, that it must
be healthy:  And it really is so; few flying before a mature
age.

   Rivers and Fish.-The principal river is the Erne; which
would abound with salmon, if they were not prevented from
getting up, by the cruives and fixed nets near the mouth of
the river.  As the proprietors above can get few of them in
summer, they take no charge of them during the spawning
season, when great numbers of them are destroyed.  It is
therefore probable, that the owners of the cruives would find
more advantage in the common use of nets, if the proprietors
of the upper grounds had an interest in protecting the salmon
during the forbidden time, because the numbers would be
much greater than what are now allowed to be bred.  And
it is a well known fact, that a very great proportion of the
salmon bred in a river return to it, unless prevented by some
accidental or artificial cause.

   Lakes and Echo.-There are several small lakes in the pa-

is surrounded by very bold craggy mountains.  It is about a
mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad.  There is also a
small lake, in the same glen, about a mile north from the
former, remarkable for the great number of trouts which are
collected in a small opening in the middle of it, the only place
which is free from weeds.  There is another lake, called the
Loch of Monivaird which covers about 30 acres, and contains
pike, perch and eels.  This lake, situated at the bottom of a
fine hanging wood, and surrounded by cultivated fields and
plantations, is a delightful object to passengers, and a great
beauty to the pleasure grounds of Ochtertyre.  It contains a
rich treasure of shell marle, which is taken up, in many
