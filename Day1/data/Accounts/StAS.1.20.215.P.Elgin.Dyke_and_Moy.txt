tors, and the other half by the parishoners.  He teaches
English and writing for 1 s. 6 d. per quarter; arithmetic
for 1 s. 8 d. per ditto; Lating for 2 s. 6 d. per ditto; mensu-
ration and land-surveying for 4 s. 6 d. per ditto; geometry for
7 s. 6 d. per ditto; and book-keeping for 10 s. 6 d. and 15 s.
He receives 1 s. 6 d. for proclamation of bans; 6 d. for re-
cording baptisms; and 4 d. for extending certificates; and
has 40 scholars at an average.  The salary and emoluments
amount to L. 33, besides his lodging, in the school-house,
which was rebuilt and stated in 1785, with a floored school-
room, and 2 small chambers, for the master's accommoda-
tion.
   The woman's school is a joint foundation, in the year
1702, resting on a bequest from John Anderson, writer in
Edinburgh; and a further destination by James Brodie of
that Ilk, the trustee, who added 500 merks to Anderson's
donation of 2000 merks, gave off ground, and built thereon
a stated house of floors, with garrets, for the accommoda-
tion of the mistress and scholars; and gave also a garden at
his own expence.  His heirs, though conjoined with the he-
ritors and session, are managers fine quibus non.  The salary,
at the beginning, in 1702, was 21 bolls bear, mortgage for
a capital of L. 138 : 17 : 9 1/12 Sterling, or L. 2500 merks,
belonging to this school.  At the redemptio of the mort-
gage or wadset, the salary was reduced to L. 6 : 18 : 10 8/12
Sterling, the legal interest of the capital.  The school-house,
though still in use, is ruinous, and in urgent need of imme-
diate repair*.

*There was once a great resort from Caithness, Sutherland, Rofs, & c.
to this boarding-school, where young gentlewomen were taught reading,
knitting stockings, marking, plain and coloured seam, and music, by the mi-
stress; and writing and arithmetic by the parochial schoolmaster.  Many
daughters of men of property were educated here, without resorting for ac-
complishments any where else.
