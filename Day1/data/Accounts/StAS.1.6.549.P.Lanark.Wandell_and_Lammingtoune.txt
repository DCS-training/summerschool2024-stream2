     NUMBER LVI.

     PARISH OF LAMINGTON.

     (PRESBYTERY OF BIGGAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND
     TWEEDDALE, COUNTY OF LANARK.)

     By the Rev. MR. THOMAS MITCHELL.

   THIS parish consists of two baronies, Lamington and
Wandel.  The first belonging to Lady Ross Baillie,
and the other to Lord Douglas of Douglas; and both present
to the kirk of Lamington, to which Wandel is annexed.-
Lamington is perhaps contracted for Lambington, a place of
pasture for sheep on hills extending long and wide; or where
was antiently a fair for lambs, which may have given rise to
its name.  And Wandel, may be put for Wandale; wan sig-
nifying pale or languid, and dale, a valley; and the place
exactly answers so that name.  As for instance Wandel mill,
it being obscured, hidden, and scarcely seen from the high way.
The present farmer has built a new house conspicuous at first
glance of the eye.  And there are in it two or three other farm
houses, not in concealed and hollow places as formerly, but
in such as are in full view, according to the modern taste.-
We differ from our forefathers in this, as in other respects.
