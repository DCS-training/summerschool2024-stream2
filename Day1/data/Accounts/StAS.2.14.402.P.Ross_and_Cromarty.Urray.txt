are attached to the Episcopal Church; and excepting also one
Roman Catholic family. The stipend is fixed at 16 chalders.
  The glebe is about 8 acres in extent. The manse was built
in 1814, and is at present in excellent condition, having been
repaired in 1837.
  Education.-There are 4 schools in the parish, two parochial
schools, one Society school, and one Episcopal school, under the
patronage of Mr Gillanders, Highfield. There is only one Sab-
bath school at present, but other two are in contemplation. All
these schools are within the compass of four miles: and no more
schools are required. The salary of each of the parochial school-
masters amounts to L.25 yearly. The probable yearly amount
of fees actually paid to one of them is not more than L.6. The
other school having newly begun, the amount of fees actually re-
ceived by the teacher cannot be stated. The probable yearly
amount of the other emoluments belonging to the first parochial
teacher is L.7. A Female School of Industry is about to be
opened under the immediate patronage of Mrs Mackenzie of Ord,
-a lady of exemplary piety, and full of zeal for supplying the
destitute with useful and scriptural education.
  Poor.-The number of persons receiving parochial aid, ave-
rages from 50 to 70. The average sum allowed to each yearly
is about 6s. The average annual amount of contributions for
relief of the poor is about L.20, all arising from church collec-
tions.
