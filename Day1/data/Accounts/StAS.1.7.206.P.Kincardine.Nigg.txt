of them twice or thrice in the summer, and bring a loading
of the boat, at the expence of above 2 L. to each crew, at
every time.  The muscles, cast upon the rock where the
tide overflows, hold if the weather be settled, and remain till
used.  If a storm prevents them catching hold, and after
they are expended, it costs a fisherman from 3 d. to 8 d. for
others each time he goes to sea; and this often in the winter,
when the fishing of January failing, as it has done these seve-
ral years, he will not gain more than their value.  The divi-
sion of the catch is one equal share to a man, after a seventh
for the boat.  The fish are carried to Aberdeen market,
where they bring a price double what it was 30 years since,
but variable with the quality, the rareness, and quantity.

   Shell Fish.-About four years ago, a new method was
brought in at the Cove for catching the lobster, which is
good in spring, and the crab, which becomes so in summer.
A basket, 5 feet long, 2 feet wide, nearly a cylinder, cutting
a good section off for a bale, is formed of plain wood, in flits,
for the bottom, and of hoops for the curve, netted over.
From the ends the net-work is wrought inward into a nar-
row entrance for the fish, bait being hung within to entice
it.  It is sunk with a weight, having a rope and buoy.  The
crab enters, falls down, and cannot get out.  To the effect
of this simple machine, which costs 10 s. 6 d. they attribute
the cloathing of their families after the hardships of 1783,
and some following years.  That for lobsters is of less size,
and sunk near the rock foot.  From 12 at nighty in summer,
to several hours into morning, the fisherman goes out to sea,
lays his line at dawn, which is the best time for the fishing,
at slack of ebb or flow, when the current of tide does not
impede, and returns with his catch.  Then he draws his
creels for shell-fish.  The woman, who has been from 3 or 4
