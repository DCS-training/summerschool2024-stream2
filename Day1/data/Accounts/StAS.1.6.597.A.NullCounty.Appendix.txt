     of Edinburgh, etc.

   In 1792-L. 336 of the stock of this company sold for
L. 545, that is L. 162: 4: 1 1/2 per cent.
   In the year 1769-The Douglas and Co. Bank was insti-
tuted, and the stock subscribed amounted to L. 150,000.-
In a few years afte, this bank by mismanagement failed; and
it is said, this failure occasioned land to be brought into the
market, to the value of L. 750,000.
   Although this loss was hurtful to many individuals, the
country was highly benefited; for the money having been be-
stowed principally on the improvement of the soil, the gain
was lasting, and general.
   In 1763-Heriot's Hospital, which holds a great deal of
land in the vicinity of Edinburgh, gave seus* of their ground
at the rate of from 3 to 4 bolls of barley per acre per annum.
   In 1790-Heriot's Hospital feued their land at the rate of
from 8 to 10 bolls per acre yearly.
   N. B.  George Heriot, who founded this hospital for the e-
ducation of boys, was jeweller to James VI. of Scotland,
and I. of England.  He furnished jewels to Prince
Charles, afterwards King Charles I. when he went to the
court of Spain, 1623.
   These jewels were never paid for by James; but, when
Charles I. came to the throne, the debt to Heriot was
allowed to his trustees, in part of their purchase of the
barony of Broughton, then crown-lands in the neighbour-
hoos of Edinburgh.  These lands are now a part of the
foundation of this Hospital, the revenue of which is at
present between L. 3000 and L. 4000 per annum.
The sum that now produces this revenue, was, in 1627.
