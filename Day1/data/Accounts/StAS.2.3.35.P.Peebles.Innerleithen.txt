     Inns.--There are three inns in the village; two of them large
and commodious,--each having an ordinary or public table during
the spring and summer seasons.
    Fuel.--Except among the shepherds living in the heads of the
hopes and glens, who use peats, the fuel chiefly depended upon by
the inhabitants is coal from Lothian. The nearest is 16 miles
distant. But a new road up tile Leithen is now making, and will
be completed next summer; by which the conveyance of coal will
be facilitated, and the expense diminished.

                     MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
    Plantations of spruce and Scottish fir in the uplands, for en-
closures to the sheep, would be a great improvement.
    There is no soil in the parish so fitted for becoming rich pas-
ture as the haughs in the valley of the Tweed.  But instead of
water-dikes, as they are called, reared sometimes at great expense
along the margin of the stream, perhaps it were better that every
obstruction was removed from the river while in flood, and the
muddy waters encouraged to float over and top-dress these lands
when laid into pasture.  Experience has often shown, that no pro-
cess of manuring is so cheap and so enriching.  Besides, this would
enable the proprietor or tenant to bestow his attention and manure
upon the accessible slopes of the hills, which, in course of time, it
may be found worth while to cultivate.
