   School.-The school-house was built in a pretty substantial
manner in 1784, at about half a mile from the church;
which situation, as being more centrical, is much more con-
venient for the parishioners.  A great number of scholars
attend the school, as even the poorest of the people are be-
coming sensible of the importance of giving some education
to their children.  The salary is twelve bolls of oat-meal,
allocated on and paid by the tenants.  The school fees are
low, being only 1 s. in the quarter.  The schoolmaster is al-
ways session-clerk, for which he has a salary of 13 s. 4 d.
and certain dues, as 6 d. for registering each baptism, mar-
riage, etc.  All these emoluments put together will make
about L. 20.

   Antiquities.-There are not many monuments of antiquity
in this parish.  The most striking are two earthen mounts;
one of them close by the church-yard, and the other about
200 yards west from it.  They ar evidently artificial, the 
outside being sod, or turf, inclosing sand or light earth.
They appear to have been exactly circular, contracted a lit-
tle as they ascend, and quite level on the top.  The circum-
ference at the bottom is 150 feet, at the top 120, and the 
height is 42.  The tradition concerning them is, that they
were places for administering justice; so their name imports,
for they are called tom mhout, i.e. the court hill.

   There are in different parts of this parish circles of large
flat stones, standing on one end on the ground, supported 
between two other large stones buried under ground, so that
where there is a single circle above, there is a double one
under ground.  They are said to be Druidical temples.
