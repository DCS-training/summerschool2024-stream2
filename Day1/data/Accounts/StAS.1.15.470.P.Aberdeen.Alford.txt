     Statistical Account

the common meaning of language here is totally reversed
and servants do not so much serve as rule and tyrannize over
their masters.  The subtenants and cottars do not work much
to the principal tenants; but they pay them higher rents
than the principal pays to his landlord, and they case him of
a good many services; and though this class of possessors of
land and to the population of a country, they are not, here
at least, always to be reckoned the most useful and industri-
ous members of society.  There are many of them, who, if
their small piece of ground will barely find them subsistence,
will not endeavour to better their condition by labour or in-
dustry, though there is always work enough for labourers;
and they lead an easy, indolent life, except in harvest, which
is a season of general exertion.  The wages of artificers here
are as high as in any part of Scotland, and those of day la-
bourers are 8 d. in summer and 6 d. in winter; high enough,
considering their work; yet the high price of meal common-
ly proves a stronger inducement to make them work than
these wages.  Working by the piece, except at mason-work
and dyking, is not general in this country; nor will the coun-
try people undertake it even for common works, such as
trenching, ditching, etc. unless they have an enormous pro-
fit.
   The fuel of this country is peat, wood, turf, heath broom,
etc.  With the first there are only two estates in the parish
supplied; and though the tenants of those properties are on
a better footing than the others, still the labour of procuring
peats is so great, that it admits of a doubt, whether coal, un-
der the disadvantages of a high price, and a long carriage,
would not be cheaper.  Except the roots and crops of trees,
wood is little used for fuel, as it is very expensive; and broom
and heath require much labour.
