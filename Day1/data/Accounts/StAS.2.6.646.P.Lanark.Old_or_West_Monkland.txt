   12. Netherhouse.  Pits from 30 t0 40 fathoms, with the three
main seams, Pyotshaw, main, and splint.
   13. Easter House.  This is the north-west boundary of the
Monkland seams.  Th pits are about 40 fathoms.  Three seams
are found, but the splint only is wrought.  The metals here are
much deranged, and the coal much injured with the whin.
   14. Mount Vernon.  Pit (in Barony,) 70 fathoms.  Two
seams Pyotshaw and main.  The splint is from 12 to 15 fathoms
below, but is so thin that it is not worth working.  The strata
here are as follow:

   15.  Rosehall.  Two pits in one shanking.  Deepest 26 fa-
thoms to main, and 16 fathoms to splint; in all, upwards of 49
fathoms.  The succession of strata here is as follows.

   The enterprising tenants of the Rosehall colliery are Addie
and Miller.  I have been favoured by Mr Addie with the num-
ber of men employed at this work.  The additional number em-
polyed at other works is very great.  At Rosehall, there are, in
constant occupation, 117 colliers, 2 bottomers, 3 pitd-roads men,
2 pit-head men, 20 labourers, 2 engine-men, 2 smiths, 1 wright,
4 carters, 2 sawyers, 1 manager, 1 clerk,--in all 157.
   Ironstones.--The Monkland ironstones are, economically speak-
ing, of immense value, and are the principal source of the wealth
and bustle in which this prosperous distirict is at present so agree-
ably involved, for if it were not for the ironstones, not one-half of
the coals could have been wrought out.  The following are the
principal bands of the Monkland ironstone.
   1. The Upper Black Band.  It lies about 24 fathoms above
the ell-coal, as indicated in the succession of strata, page 644.  It
