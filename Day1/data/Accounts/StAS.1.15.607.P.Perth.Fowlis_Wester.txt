     Of Foulis Wester.

   Highway.-The greatest improvement lately made in the
parish, is the construction of the new line of road leading
through it from Perth to Crieff, which is every where at least
35 feet broad, and has in no part a greater rise than of one
foot in 50.  Whereas, the old line, which led close by the
church, and over the brae of Foulis, frequently rose at the
rate of more than one in ten feet.  The making of this new
road, from Methven to Gowan hill, in this parish, cost 260 L.
each mile, and from that point westward, 239 L.; besides
bridges, the largest of which is not yet founded; and the
smaller ones have been executed at 1 L. each foot in width:
besides also the filling up of dens or ravines, the largest of
which alone cost 130 L.  Where the bottom is best, or mate-
rials nearest, it may be kept in repair at 2 L. a mile; but the
greatest part of it is to be upheld three years, at 4 L. a mile
annually.  The expenee of making has been so great, and
the resort of travellers hitherto so small, that the duties col-
lected at the toll-bar, first erected in 1793, though some-
what higher than in other counties of Scotland, are not suf-
ficient to pay the interests of the sums expended.

   Poor, Religion, Character.-The poor, who are under the
necessity of begging, are not very numerous; but no stated
contribution, nor any assessment being made by the heritors
for their support, they cannot be sufficiently supplied, or
begging prevented, by the small funds allotted to their use.
Those consist of the collections at the church door, amount-
ing to 3 s. weekly; 2 s. from every bride in the parish; and
the annual rent of 70 L.  By far the greatest number of beg-
gars come from other parishes.  There are commonly two
schools, besides that of the parochial schoolmaster.  He has
from the heritors 200 merks Scots of salary, with a free
house and garden.  His wages from the scholars may
