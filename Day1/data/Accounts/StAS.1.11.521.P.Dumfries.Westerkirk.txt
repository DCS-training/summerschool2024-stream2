der the name of the Cheviot breed.  Every farmer disposes of
his whole lambs, excepting what he retains for keeping up
his flock, i.e.  he reserves as many of his best ewe lambs,
when he sells the others in the month of July, as are equal to
what of his flock had died since the Michaelmas preceding,
and the number of draught ewes which he intends to dispose
of in the September following: At this season, he disposes yearly
of some of the oldest and worst of his ewes.  The number of
draughts that he sells annually, is about a seventh part of the
whole; and therefore the oldest of his sheep are not more
than 7 years of age.  A ewe 8 years old may be expected to
bring a better lamb than when she was 4 or 5; but her fleece
will be both coarser and lighter, and she be in greater danger
of dying during the winter or spring.  The lambs and draught
ewes are generally sold into Northumberland and Yorkshire.
The sheep are salved about Martinmas.  A gallon of tar,
mixed with a Scotch stone of butter will salve, of young and
old throughout the flock, about 4 s.  One man will salve 20
sheep in a day.  Of late years the farmers have been in use
to buy tups of the Cheviot breed; and, by this improvement,
the value of wool is supposed to be increased at the rate of
about 2 s. 6 d. per stone.  Till this season, the price of wool
had increased there several years.  Some of it sold, last year,
as high as 18 s. a stone:  This year (1793), it is fallen about
5 s. a stone.  Eight fleeces, at an average, go to a stone.

   Bridges and Roads.-There are in the parish, to the great
accommodation and safety of travellers, 16 stone bridges.
These, however, are mostly built on a small scale; none of
them has more than one arch, excepting that which is over
the Esk, in the neighbourhood of the church, and consists of
3 arches.  This was built about 50 years ago, and at the ex-
