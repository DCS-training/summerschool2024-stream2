	                  PARISH OF GLENBUCKET.

                 PRESBYTERY OF ALFORD, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

                    THE REV. ROBERT SCOTT, MINISTER.

                   I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THIS parish derives its name from two Gaelic words,
gleann, a glen, and buidhe, signifying yellow, or from the stream of
Bucket, which intersects the glen, taking its rise among the lofty
mountains; separating Glenlivat and Glenbucket, and which falls
into the Don below the venerable castle, the seat of the
ancient Gordons of Glenbucket.  The castle stands in a com-
manding and beautiful situation, totally neglected, and fast falling
into complete ruin.
   Extent.-The average breadth of the parish is about one mile
arable, and, including the mountain ranges, abnut 2 1/2 miles; its
length arable about 6 miles,-including the mountains, 10 miles.
   The parish is almost surrounded by Strathdon : for a small
space to the north-west it adjoins Cabrach and Glenlivat.  But
from these, it is separated by a regular range of lofty mountains.
   A narrow and romantic pass leads into the parish from the east,
commencing at the conflunce of the rivers, Don and Bucket, be-
low the castle.
   Craigenscore is the highest hill in the parish; it lies to the north,
and rises about 2000 feet above the level of the sea.  Benneaw
is the next highest, and is 1800 feet above the level of the sea,
The castle is built on the acclivity of this hill.
   Climate.-The climate is severe.  In the summer months it is
sometimes excessively hot; in winter, north winds, deep snows,
and keen frosts prevail, which frequently continue long, and make
late and bad spring months.
   Geology.-The rocks are generally primitive.  There are to
be found, hornblende, felspar, gneiss, mica-slate, granite, and pri-
mitive limestone in great abundance, which contains about seventy
per cent lime.  It is worked to great advantage by the tenants,
both for their own use and for sale.
