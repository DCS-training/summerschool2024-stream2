still a moderate sum of free teind in the parish.
   This parish, like many others, seems to have had no settled mi-
nister for some time after the Revolution in 1688.  We find, from
the records of Presbytery, that competing calls were given about
this period to a Mr Robert Barclay, by the people of Dalserf and
Strathaven.  Under date August 26th 1690, there is the following
entry in the minutes of Presbytery, " With reference to the parish
of Dalserf, the Presbyteyy find, that that parish in their present
circumstances, cannot give a legal call to a minister for vant of an
eldership.  To remove this difficulty, they appoint, at the desire
of that people, Mr G. Cleland (of Shotts) to preside at the no-

settled at Carnock; Alexander Adamson, ordained 19th May
1697 ; Francis Aird, ordained (date not known); William Steel,
(of Wygateshaw) ordained 20th August 1730 ; John Risk or-

26th September 1805 ; retired from the duties of his office in
1817, and has since lived in England; John Russell LL.D.
ordained A. and S. 29th April 1817; and has since been the only
resident minister, and had the sole pastoral chargd of the

   The chapel at Larkhall, formerly referred to, is in the earliest
class of places of worship erected under the impulse of the Ge-
neral Assembly's Church Extension movement.  There was
most urgent need of it.  The people were far too poor to do much
for themselves, and were deeply indebted to distant and generous
friends.  The chapel was opened for public worship l0th January
1836.  Mr James Macletchie, who had some time previously been
appointed preacher and catechist for the district, officiated for
