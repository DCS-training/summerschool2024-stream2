with other human bones, and several earthen urns.  It is
generally believed they had been there since the battle of
Largs.  The name Hailley seems to give countenance to
this conjecture, being derived from the old Saxon word had
il, a grave.
   In the parish of Dalry, on the south-east boundary of
Largs, is a farm, called Camp-hill, where the Scotch army is
said to have been encamped previous to the engagement.
   Between that and the village of Largs is Routdonburn,
supposed to derive its name from a detachment of Haco's
army being routed there; and Don, is a contraction for
Dane.  What renders this more probable is, that, on the
bank of the Routdonhurn, is a large cairn of stones; upon
removing part of which, lately, a stone coffin was found.
Between that and the sea is Burly-gate; a little lower, in the
Earl of Glasgow's plantations is Killing-craig; and farther
southward is Kipping-burn, where it is said, a number of
the flying Danes were met by Sir Robert Boyd, ancestor to
the Earl of Kilmarnock, afterwards the friend and confident
of the famous King Robert Bruce, and put to the sword.
   These names are a kind of confirmation of a battle having
happened at this place.
