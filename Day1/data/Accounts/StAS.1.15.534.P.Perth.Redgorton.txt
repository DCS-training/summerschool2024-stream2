   In the whole of this parish, three fourths of which were
within these few years heath and swamps, there are little
more than 300 acres of muir, the rest being under tillage, or
covered with trees.  In the lower part of the parish there are
3289 acres.

   Population.-In the year 1755 by Dr Webster's computa-
tion, the numbers were 1074.  There must have been a mistake
here: for in the year 1763, when the present incumbent was
settled, by an accurate survey, the number of souls amounted
to little more than 600.  In the year 1772, they amounted
to 1700 and odds, and now to 2123, of which 507 are under
10 years of age.  But as some of the manufactures are in a
state of infancy, and as there are not yet houses built within
the parish sufficient to accomodate those employed therein,
who are obliged to lodge in the neighbouring parishes, the
present numbers are but an imperfect sketch of the hands
employed in the various branches of trade.  Houses are con-
tinually building; so that, in a few years, the numbers of this
parish will probably be doubled; particularly at the cotton
works in Cromwell Park, where at present two floors only
are filled with machinery; but before Whitsunday next, the
whole will be completed, which will bring an increase of
400 or 500 inhabitants.
   As the register of births and burials is not accurately
kept; as poor people in many cases omit entering their
names in the register, to avoid the trifling expence of
registration, and some bury the dead without the assistance
of the sexton, the account of either cannot be exact: but
from the most authentic documents that can be collect-
ed, the annual births, for some time past, at a medium, a-
mount to somewhere betwixt 80 and 100, the burials be-
twixt 20 and 30, and the marriages about 18.
