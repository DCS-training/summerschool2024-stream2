   Character of the Inhabitants.-They are, in general, very
industrious, and live plainly, and in such sobriety, that, since
1788, three different attempts, to settle an ale-house among

parish, that of Kemnay; so that tha session got a bier made
to carry them to the grave, not being able to afford coffins for
