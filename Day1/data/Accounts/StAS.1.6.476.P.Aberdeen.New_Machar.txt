are generally engaged in managing their litte spots of ground,
providing fuel, etc.-On this account such of the gentlemen,
and even principal tenants, as have occasion for constant labou
rers, make terms with them, when they let their small posses-
sions; and it may be observed, that such labourers, under good
masters, live more comfortably than the middling tenants do.
   The tenants in this parish, and the under tenants, are bound
to some personal services.-They are obliged ot carry lime,
sand, timber and slates, for building and repairing the church,
manse, minister's offices, and the heritors houses; and it is
but fair to remark, that with such discretion have these presta-
tions been exacted, that although the buildings already men-
tioned have been lately executed, the heritors have paid so
much regard to the interest of their tenants, that, for their
own houses they have carried all the materials, and have paid
a sum of money to the workmen engaged for the new church,
to carry all the materials wanted.-In some estates in the pa-
rish, the tenants are bound to two or three days in the harvest,
and some days at casting and leading peats.-Some of the un-
der tenants are bound in this way to the principal tacksmen.
   There is no post-office within this parish, the nearest to it
are those at Aberdeen and Old-Meldrum; the distance from
that at Aberdeen is 10 miles, from Old-Meldrum 8.  The in-
terior parts of the country, from this circumstance, labour un-
der disadvantages.
