farmers and the poor people, which, with the herring that fre-
quent this coast almost every autumn, and continue till the
spring, make a good and wholesome diet.  The herrings are
the only fish caught in this coast, except a few salmon caught
at Stale fishing, and some cuddies, of a very small size, in the
summer months.  These were so numerous this season, as to
be taken with nets, although the common way of fishing them
is with a hook and bait.  I cannot here omit mentioning an
uncommon kind of fish called gobichs, that made its appear-

with the greatest violence, so that the people took them alive
in large quantities.  The body of this fish was long, and its
head resembled that of a serpent's:  its weight never exceeded
3 or 4 ounces:  many of them were found dead on the shore.
The sowing of oats and pease commences here at February,

on or before 12th of May.  Harvest generally begins along
the coast about 2th of August, and is general by the 12th
of September.

   Stipend, Poor.-The kirk was built in 1764, and the manse
in 1766; the latter was repaired in 1791; and both are now
in a tolerable state of repair.  The church holds, for ordinary,
from 600 to 700 people.  Captain M'Kenzie of Cromarty is
patron.  The stipend is 9 chalders and 1 boll of barley, 3
chalders and 3 bolls oat-meal, and 98 L. 9 s. 8 d. Scotch of mo-
ney, of which there are 60 L. for communion elements. There
is, besides, half the glebe of Kilmuir, and a glebe about the
manse, of between 30 and 40 acres, which rented at the time
of the annexation 7 1/2 bolls, but by its being totally neglected
since that time, was of little or no value at the accession of
the present incumbent to the living, being mostly all covered
over with heath.-The number of poor on the roll of the
