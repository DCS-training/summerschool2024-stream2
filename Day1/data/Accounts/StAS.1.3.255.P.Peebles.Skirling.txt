   Productions.-Natural grass is found here on the hills and
plains.  White clover grows spontaneously in some fields.
We have pot-herbs of all sorts, and various kinds of ash,
elm, beech, plane, and sir trees.  A great part of the parish
has lately been sown with grass-feeds for pasture.  There are
between 70 to 80 horses in the parish.  The chief crop
here is oats, with which between 300 and 400 acres are an-
nually sown.  Each acre, at an average, will produce between
5 and 6 bolls.  Between 30 to 40 bolls of peace are the ut-
most that are sown in one year; this crop being most readily
damaged by frost.  Potatoes and turnips thrive in the soil.
An acre of potatoes planted in the drill way, with the
plough, will produce about 20 bolls Linlithgow measure,
