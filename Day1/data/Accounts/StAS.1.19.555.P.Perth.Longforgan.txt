circumstances which would seem to give countenance to
the tradition.  the supposed original bed of the river, not-
withstanding the distance of time when this change is said
to have happened, and the improvements of these 50 years
back, is still low, morally, and swampy, almost through its
whole course.  In many places, it is actually covered with
water still; and it abounds with the same species of marsh-
reed, which grows upon the verge of the river Tay, about
Errol, Monorgan, Seaside, etc.  Upon several places near
the hills are found sand banks and gravel, particularly at
Glencarse, Rait.  Castle-Huntly, in the vale between For-

been found fixed in the rocks, for fastening ships, and that in
the charter there is the remarkable expression-Ubi olim
