     Statistical Account

tage which the lower end of this parish has received of late
years, is a new line of road from Drumen to Rowerdennan,
which (the ferry intervening)joins the great road from
Dunbarton to Inverary on the south side of Lochlomond.
There is always a ferry-boat kept by the family of Mon-
trose at Rowerdennan, and another by the family of Arro-
char on the opposite side.  The ferrying place on this side
has, of late years, been made pretty convenient for passen-
gers; a quay has been built both for the safety of the boats,
and for the conveniency of horses getting into and out of
the boats; as also a convenient public house.  The line
of road from Drumen to Rowerdennan was begun and for-
med by the statute work; bridges were built on the burns,
partly by the vacant stipend, partly by the bridge-money
got from the county, and partly by the Duke's money'
This road while carried on by the statute work, went on
very slowly; though begun above 30 years ago, it could
not be laid to be finished till last year; but now that it is
finished, it must greatly attract the attention of travellers,
being for several miles up the side of the loch, highly beau-
tiful and picturesque; interspersed with woods and beauti-
ful fields of grass and arable grounds; commanding at the
same time an extensive and delightful prospect of Loch-
lomond, and of the principal islands in it, as also of the
many fine seats around the loch.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-In the lower end of the pa-
rish is the house of Buchanan, the present seat of the family
of Montrose.  This place for near 700 years belonged to
Buchanan of that ilk, and was the seat of that ancient fa-
mily, but has been now for some time in the possession of
the family of Montrose.-At Inversnaid in the upper
end of the parish, there was, about 80 years ago, a fort
