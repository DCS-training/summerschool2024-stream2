     Statiscal Account

improvements at Conan-side, the proprietors of which place
have farmed it for a series of years past.  The manse was
built in the year 1777.  The present church has been re-
cently condemned, as unworthy of reparation, and a new
one is begun to be built in a different and more eligible
situation; for which, and a wall to inclose it, a sum of
L. 580 Sterling is allotted.  Besides the parochial school,
there are two others, in the more remote districts of the pa-
rish, established by the Society for propagating Christian
Knowledge, and to the support of which, the respective
proprietors laudably contribute.  All these schools, for a
great part of the year, are numerously attended, and pro-
ductive of the most beneficial consequences, in dissusing a-
mong the people religious instruction, and civilization of
manners.

   Farms, Produce, etc.-The farms in this parish are small,
paying, at a medium, it is supposed, about 18 bolls, or nearly
that value, between money and victual.  After payments of
the rent, the subsistence they yield to the tenant is extremely
scanty.  Tradesmen and day-labourers occupy a great many
crofts, or smaller possessions, which pay from a few shillings
to L. 2. of rent.  There are, however, a few farms in the
parish, of considerable extent, and of which the possessors
enjoy more favourable circumstances.  Some of these are
furnished with cattle of large size, and implements for hus-
bandry of a correspondent good quality.  Very little of
the ground has been inclosed.  The crops commonly raised
are barley, oats, and potatoes, with some pease and rye.
No wheat, and but an inconsiderable quantity of grass
feeds, are sown in this parish.  The horses used here are
generally of a small size.  The black cattle care of rather
better quality.  The sheep are incosiderable in number,
and of the common Scotch breed.
