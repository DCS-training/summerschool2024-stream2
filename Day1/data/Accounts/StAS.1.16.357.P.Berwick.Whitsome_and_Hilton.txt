would be truly the untutored and unlettered sage described
by Horace,

     "Abnormis sapiens crassaque Minerva."

     
     "His native energy despises rules;
     "Nor takes he sense or science from the schools."

   The common people are moderate, sensible, and sober
nor have any of them for there 40 years been charged with
a capital crime.  Nor do I recollect either riot, violence,
or disorder among them.  Such as have had an opportuni-
ty of a better education, have imbibed it with docility and
success.  Nor do I know, on the other hand, any instances
of very splendid abilities, or extraordinary exertions among
them.  Any thing like commerce with them consists in
the sale of corn, eggs, poultry, etc. to Berwick.

     ADDENDA.

   1.  I have not been able to ascertain the acres nor the
rents of each farm of-Boswell of Blackadder;
but his acres, on the whole, are nearly about 960, and his
rent very exactly L. 560.
   2.  Neither the acres in general of the Earl of Wemyss,
nor the particular acres or rent of each of his farms, do I
know; but his rent is certainly about L. 1100.
