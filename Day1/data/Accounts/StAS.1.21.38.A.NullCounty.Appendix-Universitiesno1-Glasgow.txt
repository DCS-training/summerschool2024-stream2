illustration of the various mental operations, as they are ex-
pressed by the several modifications of speech and writing;
which leads him to deliver a system of lectures on general
grammar, rhetoric, and belles lettres.  This course, accom-

the students, is properly placed at the entrance to philosophy:
no subjects are likely to be more interesting to young minds,
at a time when their taste and feelings are beginning to open,
and have naturally disposed them to the reading of such au-
thors, as are necessary to supply them with facts and materi-
als for beginning and carrying on the important habits of re-
flection and investigation.

   Moral Philosophy.-The lectures in the MORAL PHILOSOPHY
class consist of three principal divisions.  The first compre-
hends natural theology; or the knowledge, confirmed by hu-
man reason, concerning the being, perfections, and opera-
tions of God.  The second comprehends ethics; or enquiries
concerning the active powers of man, and the regulation of
them, both in the pursuit of happiness, and in the practice of
virtue; and, consequently, those questions that have been
gitated concerning good and evil, right and wrong.  The
third comprehends natural jurisprudence, or the general rules
of justice, which are founded upon the rights and the condi-
tion of man; whether considered as an individual, or as a
member of a family, or as a member of some of those vari-
ous forms of government which have arisen from the social
combinations of mankind.
