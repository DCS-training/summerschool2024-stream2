tient kingdom of Galloway, it was of consequence inhabited
by a tribe of the Celts.

   Antiquities and Natural Curiosities.-The Castle of Dunskey
is the only remarkable building in the parish.  It stands up-
on the brink of a tremendous precipice on the edge of the 
Irish sea, and has been secured on the land side by a ditch and
draw-brigde, the remains of which are still visible.  It was
certainly built as a place of security against sudden incursions
in the days of violence, and in former times must have been 
easily defended.  A cave in the neighbourhood of Dunskey
ought also to be mentioned, on account of the great vene-
ration in which it is held by the people.  At the change
of the moon (which is still considered with superstitious re-
verence), it is usual to bring, even from a great distance, in
firm persons, and particularly ricketty children, whom they
often suppose bewitched, to bathe in a stream which pours
from the hill, and then dry them in the cave.

   The Cairnpat, which rises 800 feet above the level of the
sea, and supposed to be the second or third mountain in
Galloway, merits also to be noticed.  It bears all the marks
of having been a military station, being surrounded by three 
stone walls or intrenchments, with very ample spaces between
them, and commands a prospect of Loch Ryan and of Luce
Bay, which form the peninsula in which Portpatrick is situ-
ated; England also, the Isle of Man, Ireland, and part of
the Highlands of Scotland, are seen rising at a distance.
