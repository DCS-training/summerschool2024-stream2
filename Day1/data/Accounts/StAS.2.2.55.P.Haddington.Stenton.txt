                   PARISH OF STENTON.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE.

           THE REV. D. LOGAN, MINISTER.

        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE name of the parish is of Saxon derivation; it was
originally Stanton, Scotice Stanetoun. The parish was supposed
by some to have been so called from parts of the adjacent lands
abounding in small stones, but more likely from the proximity of
an excellent freestone quarry, and the cottages in the village being

   Extent.-The low and populous part of the parish extends to
about 3 1/2 miles from north to south, and to about 3 from east

peak on the Lammermoor range, at the base of which on the south,
points of the parishes of Spott, Cranshaws, Longformacus, and
Whittingham, come so near to that of Stenton, that inhabitants of
each parish might almost hold converse with one another from their
respective parishes.
   The height of the parish above the level of the sea is about 180
