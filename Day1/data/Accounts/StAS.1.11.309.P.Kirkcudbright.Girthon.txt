   Climate.-The air and climate vary with the soil and sur-
face.  In the high lands, and to the E. and N., they are cold
and unpleasant: In the low lands, and towards the S., they
are mild and agreeable.  Though the frequent rains render
the soil there rather moist; yet, from its being defended with
the hills and high lands, exposed to the fun, and open to the
sea breezes, the atmosphere which covers its is, in general, pure
and healthy.  The diseases, which appear here, are in no re-
spect peculiar.  They are such as afflict the inhabitants of all
the southern districts of Scotland.

   Cultivation, Animals, Fuel, Etc.-The system of agriculture
is the same here, that is generally adopted by all who cultivate
land near the sea coast*.  The horses are mostly bred by the
farmers.  The cows are of the well known Galloway breed.
The sheep are of the small moor kind.-various forts of game
and wild animals are found here: Grouse, black-cocks, par-
tridges, hares, rabbits, woodcocks, badgers, foxes and pole-
cats.-Peats, the fuel used by the farmers and cottars, are
dear, owing to the distance of the mosses, and the bad roads
which lead to them.

   Rivers, Fish, and Lakes.-The Fleet, which bounds this pa-
rish to the W. is a beautiful winding river, and disembogues
itself into Wigton Bay.  There is a salmon fishing belonging
to it, now of little value; owing probably to the lime import-
ed, and to a soap house lately erected on its banks.  The
lakes are, Loch-Fleet, the source of the river, abounding
with trouts: Loch-Scero, aboundlug with pike: Loch-Grun-
nock, about 3 miles long, and, in some places, 1 mile broad,
