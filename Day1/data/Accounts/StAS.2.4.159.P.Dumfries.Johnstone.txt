one of the most magnificent edifices in the south of Scotland.

			III.-POPULATION.
	In  1755, the population was, by the return to Dr Webster,      494
	    1791,                                                       565
	    1801, by the Census,                                        740
	    1811,                                                       904
	    1821,                                                      1179
	    1831,                                                      1234
	The increase of the  population seems chiefly to have arisen
from the establishment, about fifty years ago, of new small farms
on the hitherto uncultivated moorlands of Mr Johnstone's estate;
from more recent grants of building leases to respectable trades-
men and others; and from the general prosperity of its agricul-
ture.

	Character and Habits of the People.--The prevailing popular
games are curling in the winter, and quoits in summer; for supe-
rior skill in both of which manly and exhilarating exercises, this
parish has for some years past been confessedly distinguished.
	The people are cleanly in their habits, and seem never to forget
that a black and white home-made plahd (be it in the month of June
or January, and the weather what it may,) is essential to complete
their dress when they go abroad, to church or market. Oatmeal
made into porridge or cakes, and potatoes used with milk, and occa-
sionally a little mutton, or beef, or bacon, is the ordinary food of the
peasantry, who are industrious in their callings, and in their circum-
stances contented and happy. Though not much engrossed in lite-
rary or intellectual pursuits, our inhabitants are yet an intelligent, mo-
ral, and church-going population. Poaching of salmon in the river
Annan, though not so common as it was thirty or forty years ago,
is sometimes practised during the winter season, but chiefly by
persons not resident in the parish; and we fear that until the pro-
