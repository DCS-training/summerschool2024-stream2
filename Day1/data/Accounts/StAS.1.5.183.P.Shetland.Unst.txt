     of Unst, in Shetland.

Vallafield, rising within a mile and a half of its southern
extremity, runs in a direction parallel to the western coast, and
under different names, to the very northern point.  Saxaforth,
a hill of considerable height, and the highest in the island,
lies towards its northern end.  Crossfield stands nearly in
the middle, and at right angles to Vallafield.  Vordhill
stretches out parallel to the east coast.  Tracts of level
ground are interspersed among these hills.  The highest of
the hills are still covered with moss, or black peat earth, to
the depth of some feet.  On such as are lower, (and there
are several besides those which have been enumerated), the
mosses have been exhauted, and the bare rocks appear here
and there, through a thin layer of mould, covered with a
green dry sward, which yields excellent pasture.  The
hill of Saxaforth is not less than 700 feet high, and may be
seen 14 leagues off the coast.  Vallafield rises to the
height of 600 feet.  The islands intersected by no rivers;
but contains, (in proportion to its extend at least) many
small fresh water lakes.  Loch Cliff is two miles long, and
small half a mile bread.  The seenery is pleasant along its
banks.  A chain of smaller lechs run from Cliff to the
southern end of the island.

   Sea-coast.-The sea-coast of Unst being broken and in-
dented by so many bays and creeks, its extent cannot  be
easily ascertained, nor has any accurate measurement of it
been yet attempted.  Several islets are scattered here and
there around it.  All the shores exposed to the main ocean,
but especially the head lands, are considerably high and
rocky.  The highest of the head lands rises to the height of
60 or 70 sathoms.  The shores of the bays and harbours
again are low, shelving, and sandy.  The little isle south of
about a square mile in extent, and inhabited, lies south of
Unst, and forms, upon that quarter of its island, the har-
