     The Statistical Account.

juncture, it is unpopular to name, and perhaps dangerous to
praise, have endeavoured to direct the public attention to this
important subject; and in Germany it has of late obtained
no inconsiderable degree of notice from the politico-philoso-
phers of that extensive and improving country.  But the ex-
ertions of these foreigners must be long continued before
their object can be attained; steps of considerable magnitude
must be taken by government, and several important changes
effected, before such schemes can be put into execution.  Hap-
pily, for us, no such violent measures are necessary; and no
grand obstacles prevent our immediate acquisition of the end
in view.  We already enjoy an institution, which affords a
tried and solid basis for any additional superstructure: an edi-

ply every purpose of accommodation.
   The following, or some similar, plan, with regard to parish
schools, might be adopted; which would be not less easy and
gentle in its execution, than effectual and important in its
consequences.

enhance the price of education, (which ought to be fixed at
as low a rate as possible,) nor to render the master entirely
dependant on his scholars, and, at the same time, to fix on a
progressive ratio of stipend, which would keep pace with the
progressive influx of money and demands of life; every in-
convenience would be obviated, and every valuable end would
be answered.  These salaries ought to be paid, annually, by
