ance for registering baptisms and marriages; and the usual
fees paid by the scholars.  The number of these varies occa-
sionally from 20 to 50.  This is owing to the children of the
tenantry being sent to attend the cattle in the hills, during
the summer months, and their returning again to school in
the beginning of winter.  They are naturally fond of learn-
ing, shrewd, and of quick apprehension; but parents are of-
ten unable to afford the expence of giving their children
even the common education to be obtained in the country;
and the greater number of them, on this account, are so il-
literate, that they can neither read nor write.

   Poor.-There are no funds for supporting the parish poor,
except the weekly collections at the church.  These in ge-
neral amount to very little, and can afford but a very partial
relief to upwards of fifty necessitous poor, whose names are
on the roll.  In cases of this kind, common begging is un-
avoidable.  Where the law has made no particular provision,
the indigent must depend on the charity of the public at
large.

   Antiquities.-Among these may be reckoned a green hill,
on which are the remains of a ruined barrack, which was
built about the year 1725, and burnt in the year 1746.
This hill is thought to be an artificial mound of earth; and
the conjecture is supported in part from a view of its shape
and situation; but more particularly, from a circumstance
mentioned by some of the old inhabitants, that, when they
were sinking a well withing the barrack, cross pieces of wood
were found at regular distances, from the surface to the 
base; if really artificial, it must have been a work of im-
mense labour and expence.
