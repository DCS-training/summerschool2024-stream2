   The language is a mixture of Scotch and English, without
any particular accent.  In this district, as in every other, there
are certain provincial words and phrases peculiar to itself.  It
is probable that the Celtic was once the common language, as
many names of places in this parish seem to be of that etymo-
logy.
   It must strike every one, that the advantages of this parish
are very considerable.  There are good roads, great abundance
of wood, lime stone in different places, immense funds of
hard marle, and coal at no great distance.  The disadvantages
it labours under are, the uncertainty of the climate, the une-
qual and steep situation of the surface in many places, and the
springiness of the soil, the water often bursting out towards the
base of the hills.  This last inconveniency may, in a great
measure, be remedied by draining.
