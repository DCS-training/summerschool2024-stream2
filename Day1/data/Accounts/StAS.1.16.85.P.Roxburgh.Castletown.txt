     of Castletown.

The quantity of stones is immense, and they are mostly of
a very large size.  Near these, there is a large stone set on
end, about 5 feet high, called the Standing Stone.  This
cairn is in the middle of an extensive and deep moss.  It
can be approached on horse-back only on one side, and that
with much difficulty.  There is not a stone to be seen near
it.-Upon the march between the parishes of Castletown
and Canonby, and upon very high ground near to Tinnis-hill,
there is a cairn of great extent, and consisting of free-stones
of great size.  It is 86 yards long; it is not possible to ap-
proach it on horse-back.  The stones are chiefly of a square
form, of immense weight, and what is very remarkable,
there is not a stone to be seen, nor a place where stones could
be found, within a great distance of the place.  At the
north end of it, there are several large stones set on their
edges, forming a square, and covered over by one stone.
Near to the south end there is one standing perpendicular,
evidently so placed by the hand of man, 7 feet above the
moss, and 13 feet in circumference.  This was anciently
called the standing stone, and was considered the north boun-
dary of Canonby, or the debateable land*.  On examining
the ground near it, I found five other stones, nearly of an
equal size with the former, all inclining to, or lying on the
ground, forming a circle, the diameter of which is 45 yards.
How these stones were collected, for what purpose, or what
the circle has been, which is formed by stones of such im-
mense weight and size, I leave to others to determine.

of allies, which soon fell in pieces.  In this cairn were discovered a great
number of stones, formerly used for knocking bear, or making barley.  Some
among them was a stone cross, about 4 feet long.  Some other cairns
have been opened, and ashes found inclosed by 4 stones set in a square
form.
