and justly admired, for those many beautiful curves which
it decribes, and peninfolas which it forms in its course.  It
produces salmon, different forts of trout, pike, perch, eel,
and slounders.  Both in the parish, and above it, the sal-
mon fishings are inconsiderable.  The only salmon fishing
which belongs to this parish is let at about L. 7 Sterling.
As we proceed down the river, these fishing become more
valuable, till we come to the conflux of the Tay and Earn,
where salmon are caught in great abundance.  The price,
which this fort of fifth gives, in the spring is 9 d. and in sum-
mer 4 1/2 d. per pound.  The May takes its rise in the hills,
about two miles due south from Dunning, and, after describ-
ing a curve of about eight miles in length, somewhat re-
sembling a reaping hook, (the greatest part of which is con-
tained in this parish), falls into the Earn nearly opposite to
the parks of Duplin.  In this small river, the salmon spawn
below a place called the Fall of Muckarfie, but none are
caught in it.  Not to mention eels, salmon, smelt, and some
slounders, it affords in great abundance a very fine flavour-
ed trout, about the size of an herring.  The Earn is navi-
gable up to a bridge, which is built across it, about two miles
east from the village of Forgan.  Vessels, from 30 to 40 tons
burden, come to this bridge, laden with lime and coals, for
the inhabitants in the neighbourhood.

   Stones and Mineral Productions.-The only stone used in
building, to be found in this parish, is whin stone.  Iron
stone is frequent, and a species of lime stone has been found
on the banks of the May.  But neither of these sorts of
quarries have as yet been wrought.  In the wood of Condie,
which is in the Ochills, on the banks of the May, copper
was found by the grandfather of the present Mr Oliphant
of Condie.  And near the same place, on the estate of Mr
