have reason to think they are of much later origin than the
other.  Strat, or Strath, in British, denoting a valley en-
closed by hills, and lying along the banks of a river or lake.
Hence Strathearn, Strathmore, Strathdon, Strathspey, etc.
Nearly equivalent to Strath is Glen in Erse, and Dale in
Anglo-Saxon.  Thus, what with us is Clydesdale, was by
the ancient inhabitants called Stratclyde.
   This place is frequently known by the name of the Old
and New Town of Aberdeen; the former is chiefly situa-
ted near the mouth of the Don, the latter near the mouth
of the Dee.  The two rivers, at their influx into the sea,
are distant about a mile and a quarter; but this intervening
space is mostly occupied by regular streets and buildings,
which form the present city of Aberdeen,

     OLD MACHAR.

   THE parish of Old Machar was originally a deanry,
called the Deanry of St Machar, and comprehended the
parishes of Old Machar, New Machar, and Newhills.  In
times of Popery, they do not seem to have been divided
into separate parishes, but to have been chapels in the dean-
ry, at which chapels divine worship was regularly perform-
ed, as the inhabitants of so extensive and populous a district
could not conveniently meet in one place for public worship.
New Machar seems to have been erected into a separate
parish about the time of the Reformation; and Newhills
about the year 1663.  This parish is now called Old Aber-
deen, or the Old Town parish, from the city of Old Aber-
deen, in which the cathedral, now the parish-church, is
situated.
