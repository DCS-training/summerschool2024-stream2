ses in the Grampian hills, and falls into the North Eske,
passes through it.  In its course it turns many mills of dif-
ferent sorts, in this, and in the adjoining parishes of For-
doun and Aberlethnot.  Near its junction with North Eske,
it abounds in trouts.  Nine brooks likewise intersect the
parish of Laurencekirk; seven upon the southern and two
upon the northern side of the Leuther.

   Climate, etc.-This parish and the neigbourhood are
subject to frequent vicissitudes of weather; but, on the
whole, they are not unhealthy.  No particular diseases
prevail.  Forty or 50 years ago the inhabitants were fre-
quently attacked by agues in the spring.  But since the
marshes have been drained, that disease seldom makes its
appearance.  Several persons have reached the age of 90.
One is remembered to have lived above 100 years:  A
man aged 95 is now living, and has still strength to walk
4 or 5 miles, and return within the same day.

   Property.-The only proprietors of lands in this parish
are, the Earl of Kintore, Lord Gardenston, George Car-
negie, Esq; of Pitarrow, and Dr John Stuart of Red-
myre.  Lord Gardenston has a feat here, where he occa-
sionally resides.  The ancestors of the family of Kintore
long inhabited the house of Haulkerton in this parish.

   Productions, Agriculture, etc.-Seventy acres of the lands
in Laurencekirk are covered with woods, consisting of all
the variety of forest trees which grow commonly through
Scotland.  Marshes and meadows occupy 120 acres.  In
some farms a third part, in others a half of the farm is laid
down with artificial grasses, which are partly used as pa-
sture, and partly cut for hay.  Somewhat more than a half
of all the land in the parish is cultivated for the production
