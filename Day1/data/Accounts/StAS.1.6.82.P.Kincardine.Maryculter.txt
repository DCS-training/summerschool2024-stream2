   Manufactures.-Spinning and knitting worsted stockings
is the general employment of all females from 7 years old and
upwards.  The combed wool for that purpose is given out by
hosiers from Aberdeen, in different parts of the parish, on cer-
tain days, called Factory Days, on which also the wrought
stockings are received.  Each pair costs, for spinning and knit-
ting, from 1 s. to 3 s. 6 d. the cheapest are accounted the most
profitable, both to the worker and the merchant.-The com-
mon fuel is peat and furze, but the peat-mosses are now quite
exhausted.  Peats are bought in Fetteresso parish, at the rate
of 1 s. a small cart load: coals can be got cheaper in Aber-
deen *.
