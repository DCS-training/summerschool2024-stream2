duced, oats, barley and pease.  But it is supposed, that it would
be more profitable were the lands to be all laid down in
grass.  The best method of laying down is, first to lime, and
then sow with barley and grass seeds, viz. 1 bushed of rye grass

rate, in every parish, determined by the justices of the peace,
as trustees for the roads.  In every parish the assessment va-
