    The extent of undivided  common is stated at about 200 acres.
It is, at present, together with the greater propnrtion of the waste
lands, almost entirely valueless. Much, however, might be done
in the way of planting and cultivation, there being but very few
acres in the parish which are not fitted for these purposes. The
usual sorts of trees planted are ash, beech, plane, elm, birch,
larch, Scotch and silver fir. A great variety of other trees have
been introduced into the policies of Lauriston, and have been found
to succeed well. From the preceding statement of the number of
acres under cultivation in 1807 and 1837, it will be observed, that
about 800 acres of land have been brought into tillage, during the
thirty years intervening between these dates, the rate of improve-
ment being about one-quarter of an acre per cent. annually.

    Wages, Rates of Labour, Prices, Breeds of Live-Stock.-It is
unnecessary to enter into any detail regarding these, as the infor-
mation already published in accounts of contiguous parishes is ap-
plicable in every particular to these matters, in regard to this pa-
rish. It may just be added, with reference to the price of grain,
that, though the sale is effected nominally by measure, the farmer
is in fact paid according to the weight of the article, a standard
weight being assumed for the bushel, and the price ascending or de-
scending with every pound weight above or below the fixed point.
Since the introduction of this mode of computation, a considera-
ble deterioration has taken place in the value of inferior land.
    It is not customary in this parish to graze cattle or sheep by
the head. There are scarcely any sheep kept permanently in the
