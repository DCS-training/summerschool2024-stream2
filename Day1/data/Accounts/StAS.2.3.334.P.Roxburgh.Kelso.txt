    power, in very many instances,to crush crime in the bud,to arrest
    juvenile offenders at their outset on the path to ruin, and thus not
    only to secure the prosperity and peace of th community, but to
    effect a material saving in the expenditure now necessary for the
    prosecution of offences before higher tribunals.
         Town's-Funds.--The annual income of the burgh may be stat-
    ed at about L.500. Its principal sources are: the stent on the
    inhabitants already described; the proceeds of a tax on ale; the
    price obtained for fuilzie; the rent of a machine for weighing
    coals; and the interest of a sum invested on Kelso Bridge. *
         Villages.--The only village in the parish is Maxwell-heugh,
    which stands on a heugh or eminence on the south of the Tweed,
    directly opposite to the eastern part of the town. It contains
    about 100 inhabitants, and is a place of great antiquity. The
    Earl of Morton bad a residence there in the time of Elizabeth.
         Means of Communication.--There are two post-office deliveries
    daily; one when the bag from the south, and another when the
    bag from the north arrives.  No mail-coach passes through Kelso;
    but letter-carts or gigs regularly convey the bags to and from
    Hawick, where the mail passes.  Turnpike roads, to the extent of
    twelve miles, intersect the parish, and connect it with all the sur-
    roundingtowns, the principal being a branch of the great north road,

<FOOTNOTE>The following account of receipts and disbursements for a single year, as given
    in evidence before the burgh commissioners, will give a better idea both of the reve-
    nues of the burgh, and of the purposes to which they are applied, than any descrip-
    tion; though it is but fair to premise, that the items of "cleaning streets "and trades-
    men's accounts" are considerably above the average expenditure under these heads,
    in consequence of additional expenses arising in the year referred to, out of the pre-
    valence cholera, &c.
