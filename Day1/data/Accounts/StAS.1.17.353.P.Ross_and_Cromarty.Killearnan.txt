without injuring the revenue*, would, in a great measure,
prevent both.  The price of spirits would find its level in
proportion to that of grain, and the mean of intoxication
would not offer itself to the lower ranks, with such pernicious
facility as it now does in consequence of a glutted market.

   Fuel.-The only firing in this parish is a yellow spongy
moss, now almost entirely exhausted, and the wretched turf
pared off the common.  Newcastle coals are used by those
who can afford the outlay of cash, together with burn wood
and peats, subjecting such a family as the incumbent's, for a
fire in a room and a kitchen, and occasionally in bed rooms,
to an annual heavy expence of from 10 to 14 L.+.
   Several circumstances indicating the existence of coals have
occurred in different parts of this country; but a peculiar
disadvantage which prevents-discoveries of this kind is, that
the persons who are best qualified to make them, and who
are of course employed, are, in general, notoriously interested
in crushing the attempt.  Until some man of skill and spirit
shall be induced, by a participation of the profits, or other-
wise, to make proper experiments, we shall probably remain
as we are, in the want of this very essential comfort of life.

   Improvements.-Under this head, it is pleasing to remark,
that the progress, in some particulars, has of late been rapid.

*Any possible injury to the revenue could arise only from
the diminution of the quantity, and of course of the consumpt of
ardent spirits.  By the law, exportation is not permitted; and
consequently, however much the market may be overstocked,
the inhabitants of this district of country are literally compelled
to drink the superabundance.

+We have hitherto, from the advance in freight, seamen's
wages, etc.  experienced very little benefit from the suppression
of the partial Red-head tax.
