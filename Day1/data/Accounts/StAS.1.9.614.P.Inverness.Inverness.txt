the year 1754, 3268 bolls and 3 firlots victual, and L. 575,
7 s, 11 1/3 d. Sterling.  The boil at that period was valued to
the tenant at 9 merks Scots or 10 s. Sterling, with customs
and services, which were of little value to the proprietor,
but often of distressing consequences to the tenant.  The
customs and services are abolished.  The land-rent is risen
far beyond double the above, and is still increasing, nor are
the tenants by any means overburdened; they are much
better able to pay the present rents than they were to pay
the former, when oppressed by ignorance and indolence,
customs and services.  Many acres of waste land too have
been improved since the year 1754, bearing luxuriant
crops of corn, which add considerably to the rental of the
parish.  It cannot be said with precision what the number
of acres in the parish is, as all the estates have not been
measured.  The number however cannot be under 5000
arable acres.  At present lands let at from 13 s. to L. 2 an
acre.  Garden ground near the town lets at from L. 4 to L. 5.
Few estates have been sold in this parish for many years.
Lands were lately bought for no less than 35 years pur-

garden-ground.  There are about 50 heritors, 14 or 16
