   Miscellaneous Observations-There are several disadvantages
in this parish.  A scarcity of fuel is one; as coal, the only fu-
el used here, cannot be got nearer than the port of Montrose,
which is 12 miles distant; and there, coal is sold at a very high
price, (8 s and 8 s 6 d. perboll,) on account of the high duty laid
on that article, at that and the other ports on the north coast
of this island.  Every boll, or 72 stones, costs 12 s. to the con-
sumer.-Montrose is also the nearest port for exporting
grain, which, being a long carriage, is of considerable disad-
vantage to the farmer.-Lime and marle are the only means
of improvement in this parish, and these are both to drive a
considerable distance.  Good lime cannot be had nearer than
12 miles, and marle 7 miles.  There is indeed lime to be had
nearer, but of an inferior quality.
   This parish has also its advantages.  The road to the port
of Montrose, is very good, smooth, and level, without the in-
terruption of hills, and is seldom interrupted by storms in the
winter time; so that the communication is free and open at
all seasons.-This parish being contiguous to Brechin,
has a regular communication by post, every day of the week.  In
Brechin there is also a ready market for provisions of all kinds,
which can be spared from this place.  And, in return, may be
had every other article, both for the necessity and conveniency
of families.-The soil of being good, and the climate tem-
perate, give the advantage of good grain, which ordinarily
comes to full maturity, without being hurt by the early frosts,
or blasting storms in autumn; so that the farmer has the ad-
vantage of a true crop.-This parish has the advantage
of being excellently well watered, not only from the two rivers
