of a less extent.  They abound in pike, perch, carp, tench,
roach, white and red trout; and are frequented by a variety
of water sowl, such as wild ducks, teals, widgeons, coots, and
cormorants.  Swans emigrate from Ireland, particulary in
severe winters, and continue on these lakes till spring.  The
two lakes of Castle-Kennedy are very fine pieces of water,
in each of which there is an island.  The lakes are nearly
parallel; the one a mile, and the other a mile and a half in 
length, and both in some parts half a mile broad.

   Castle.-Castle-Kennedy is a large square building; and
was burnt by accident in 1715, nor has it ever since been re-
built.  The walls of the ruin still standing are 70 feet in
height.

   Church.-The manse is called Soul seat, Sedes animarum, and
is almost surrounded by a loch nearly similar in form to a
horse shoe.  The King is Patron of this Parish.  The living
is 48 bolls of meal, 16 of bear, Linlithgow measure, and
L. 45 in money, with a manse and glebe.

   Villages and Antiquities.-The Cairn is the only consider-
able village in the parish, and contains 130 souls.  It is situ-
ated on the side of Lochryan, a piece of water, and has an
excellent harbour from three to eight fathoms deep at low
water.  Here many vessels from the West Indies, bound for
Clyde, take refuge from the storm, and ride in perpect safety.
The Cairn is well situated for foreign trade, and excellently
adapted for ship-building.  Below the village, towards Ayr-
shire, there is a bold rocky shore, where there are several.
caves, extending 80 and 100 yards under ground.  The
cairns of Cairnarran exhibit an appearance truly singular.
In the extent of a Scots mile, there are nine of them, of
