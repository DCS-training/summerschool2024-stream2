			KINCARDINE IN MONTEITH.			1265

        was built by George Drummond, Esq., as above-mentioned, be-
        tween 1715 and 1717, and is a good specimen of the style of that
        time.  Although it is in extent, elegance, and convenience, wor-
        thy of its founder, and of the.estate on which it is built, yet the
        present proprietor lately added to it an elegant and extensive
        wing, which has greatly enlarged the family accommodation.
           The church of Kincardine is of recent date, a new one having
        become necessary in consequence of the decayed state of the
        former, the age of which cannot be ascertained.  That old build-
        ing had been a place of worship in Catholic times.  When the
        heritors agreed to build a plain church, more than two-thirds of
        the expense of it fell upon the estate of the late George Home
        Drummond, according to his valuation.  But, having laid before
        the heritors an elegant plan of a Gothic building, from a design
        of the late Mr Crichton of Edinburgh, he generously offered to
        pay his proportion of the plain building, and to defray all the ad-
        ditional expense of the new one, according to Mr Crichton's plan,
        expressing his wish to put an end to the poverty-struck churches
        of the district.  The heritors gratefully acceded to his offer, and
        hence the much admired structure in which the people of Kin-
        cardine worship.  The taste and example of our heritors have
        since that time been followed by some of the neighbouring pa-
        rishes, as their elegant and commodious churches evince.
          There was also a new manse lately built, which in elegance, si-
        tuation, and convenience, harmonizes with the church.

				III.-POPULATION.
	   By the former Statistical Account it appears that the amount of the population of
			this parish in 1746 was,	-	-	2000
			and in         1791,	       -       -	2068
	      Since that time it has been as under:--
	      In 1891,		-		-			2212
		 1811,         -		  -                     2419
		 1821,	    -			    -                   2388
		 1831,         -		-			2455
	      in 1881 the number of males was 1246
				    females,  1209
	      In 1841  the population was	-	-              	2232

           The increase in 1831 is accounted for by the number of men
	employed by Colonel Graham of Meiklewood, in floating the
	moss from his estate in this parish.  The excess of the males
	above the females for the same year is to be ascribed to the same
	cause.

	   Of the above population the amount in the village of Thornhill (not including
	      the rural population there.)                             in 1821 was 385
								   and in 1831,    599
