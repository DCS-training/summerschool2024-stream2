diate crops; but it is thought by some to be always a good
practice to bind the tenant to the fixes for the last six years
of the lease.  Upon the lighter ground they are permitted
to take three crops, one of them a green crop, and the last
a white crop, to be sown down with grass, and to continue
in pasture for two years at least.  This gives a greater li-
berty to the farmer in varying his crops, and cannot hurt
the ground.  He pays half a boll of wheat, and half a boll
of barley per acre, and the rest in money; the barley deli-
verable between Christmas and Candlemas, and the wheat
any time between that and the middle of June, when de-
manded, and the money at the Whitsunday following, i. e.
crop 1795 payable 1796, and so on.  The entry is generally
to the houses and grass, if there be any, at Whitsunday,
and to the land at separation of the crop the same year.
The outgoing tenant is generally permitted to sell his last
crop, corn, and fodder, and also his dung, but not to carry
any out of the barony, (manor), which is an old custom.
The houses and offices are delivered to the tenant in good
repair, which he is bound to keep up, and re-deliver at the
expiry (end) of his lease in equal good condition.  Some-
times they are appraised, and are to be given up of equal
value.
   These in a great measure explain the general principles
of farming in the carse ground of this parish, and perhaps
it is the best general rule that can be given.  But upon
rich loam, they at present divide their farms into five parts,
as they think fallow rather a prejudice, in room of which
they use drilled crops of potatoes, yams, turnips and beans,
which cleans the land effectually.  Lint and pease are also
sown as intermediate crops; and after all of which, wheat
is sometimes sown, and good crops obtained.  After the
wheat, barley sown down with clover and rye-grass; then
oats, and then a clearing crop again.
