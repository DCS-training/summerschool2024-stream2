among the ruins; so must have been erected before the
introduction of mortar by the Romans.
   Arthur's Oven, a Roman work, was no doubt built
without mortar; but this castle, if a heap of narrow arch-
ways can be called so, seems by no means a Roman work,
as no tool, nor the smallest art, has been used upon the
freestone employed in it.  I see by the Statistical Account,
that subterraneous buildings of a similar kind have been
discovered in the parishes of Applecross (vol. iii. p. 378.)
and Tealing (vol. iv. p. 101.); and as last autumn,
there was discovered in Lesmahago parish, near the fall of
Stonebyres, at a place called Cairny Castle, similar arch-
ways, in which were found two querns, or hand-mills for
grinding corn, amongst deers horns and bones of animals,
I am led to believe that those archways and subterraneous
passages were the temporary abodes of the ancient Bri-
tons; that no stone building was erected above them, but,
if any, only temporary wooden huts, from which, in
case of being set on fire by an enemy, the inhabitants
might escape through the subteranneous passages, or
secure themselves in them by covering their narrow
mouths with stones.  Indeed it would seem that Gildas
had such strange and fox-like habitations in his eye,
when he wrote of the third vastation of the Scots and
Picts, (anno 448.) as he brings them, "De arctissi-
"mis foraminum caverniculis, fusci, vermiculorum, cu-
"nei, etc.*

*The next piece of antiquity is the Castlehill, closs by, and on the S.
W. side of Lanark.  It has the appearance of an artificial mount; and per-
haps was originally fortified by the Romans, as General Roy makes mention
of a fine silver Faustina that was found here.  Upon this hill there former-
ly stood a castle, which tradition ascribes to David I.  The charter by Wil-
liam the Lion in favour of the town of Ayr, is dated from this castle, or at
