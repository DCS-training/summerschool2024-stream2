but hinders the grain from coming to great maturity.  In
dry and hot seasons, which occur rarely, the case is other-
wise:  Then the grain is sufficiently ripened, and abundantly
productive.

   Climate.-The air for the most part is moist and raw.
This is owing to the mists that so frequently float upon the
summits of the hills, and the vapour that is continually ex-
haled by the sun from the marshy grounds.  It does not ap-
pear, however, to be unfavourable to health, as the people
here attain to as great longevity as those of drier climates.

   Lochs and Rivers.-There are two lochs adjoining to each
other, partly in this parish, and partly in Etterick.  The
one is called the Loch of the Lows, and the other St 
Loch.  These are noticed in the account of the 
terick.-The only rivers in this parish are the 
Yarrow.  The course of the former has been already 
bed, vol. 3. page 295.  The latter takes its rise from St. Ma-
ry's Loch, and after an easterly course of 15 miles is absorb-
ed in the Etterick, a little above Selkirk.  Both rivers run
with great rapidity, and swell to a prodigious height.  Small
salmon occasionally ascend their streams; but the fish with
which they chiefly abound arc trout of a most delicious fla-
vour.

   Mountains and Hills.-The hills ares in general, steep and
towering.  The most remarkable are those called Blackhouse
Heights.  The highest point of elevations above the level of
the sea, measures 2370 feet.  For the molt parts the moun-
tains exhibit a green appearance.  Upon some few, there is
a considerable quantity of heath.  No rocks are visible.
