the clerk, and 2 d. to the officer; but those who attend
Bridge of Teith, Norieston, Dunblane, and Callander, from
the parish of Kilmadock, are not regular payers of the fees.

   There are several other private schools in the parish, for
teaching English and the rudiments of writing; but the
boys in the country are in great danger of colds from bad
roads.  Foot-paths on the sides of the high-ways should be-
come general, which would be a great ease to the children
in bad weather.

   The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge lately
gave L. 10 of salary for a charity school at the west end of
the parish, near Callander; and Mr Buchanan of Cambus-
more, very much to his honour, presented the schoolmaster
with a school and school-house, and garden, free.  They
are placed on the road from Callander to Craigton, about a
Scotch mile east of Callander, on a gentle rising heath, that
is quite dry and healthful, and finely exposed to the western
breeze.  There cannot be a finer situation for a village;
and, were a proper road made along from Callander by the
Heads, Craigton, Annat, etc. to join the Dunblane road by
Kilbryde, communication would be opened in the upper
parts of the parish, where, at present, no person can travel.

   Of all other objects of the legislature, proper teachers,
and proper parochial schools, is the most important; and,
with all respect and deference to the office and dignity of
our reverend divines, it is humbly submitted, if a diligent,
sober, pious teacher of youth, be not an equally exalted cha-
racter, and equal, if not more useful, towards the propaga-
tion and establishment of vital religion, morality, and vir-
tue.  The illustrious King of Israel was deeply sensible of
this, when he said,

     Train up a child when he is young
       In the way wherein he ought to go,
