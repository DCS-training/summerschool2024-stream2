   Climate, etc.-From the vicinity of this district to the sea,
the air is generally moist, and the climate variable; great
quantities of rain falling in the spring and autumn, which
proves a considerable hinderance to farming operations.  Not-
withstanding these circumstances, the inhabitants are for the
most part healthy, few diseases being epidemical among them;
and many of them live to a great age.  An example of un-

carry off a good many; and hitherto, all efforts to introduce
inoculation have failed.  No arguments can overcome the su-

   Soil, Agriculture, etc.-As this quarter abounds so much
in hills, the soil, upon the whole, must be poor, and in many
