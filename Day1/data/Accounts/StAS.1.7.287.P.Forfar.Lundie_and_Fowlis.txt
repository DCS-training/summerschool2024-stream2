   Ecclesiastical State of both Parishes.-The manse, and a
glebe of six acres, are situated at Lundie.  The stipend con-
sists of 4 chalders of victual, one half meal, the other barley,
and 30 L. in money, including communion elements.  It may
be estimated at 70 L. per annum.  Colonel Alexander Dun-
can of Lundie is supposed to be patron of both parishes,
though Sir William Murray claims the patronage of Foulis.
The church of Lundie lies exactly 3 miles and 120 feet dis-
tant from Foulis, in a north-west direction.  When it was
built cannot be ascertained; nor is there any thing very re-
markable about it, except an elegant monument lately erected
at the east end of it, by Lady M. Duncan of London, in me-
mory of her husband, the late Sir William Duncan, physician
to his Majesty, who lies interred there.  But the church of
Foulis merits particular notice, as a remarkable piece of an-
cient architecture.  It is 88 feet 10 inches in length, and 27
feet 9 in breadth, and is built all of hewn stone.  It is per-
fectly entire, without the least symptom of decay, although
it was built in the year 1142, during the time of the Cru-
sades, as appears by an inscription on a large oak beam that
supported the organ loft, having been erected in consequence
