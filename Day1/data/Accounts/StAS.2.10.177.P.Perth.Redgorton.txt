       Coins.-In 1789 there were found on the farm of Balmblair, at
     a place called the Dumbie's Know, by the side of a large stone, as
     many of David's groats and half groats and Edward's pennies, as
     amounted, at the price of bullion,, to three pounds. Some of the
     groats were in beautiful preservation, and without a single flaw.

       On the 4th of June 1834, there were found under a large stone,
     close beside the Thistle Bridge, which is a rock of trap that cros-
     ses the Tay under the water, about 1500 coins of different reigns
     and dates.  Of these 540 were dispersed among different indivi-
     duals, of which no account can be now obtained; and 872 are in
     the possession of Mr Greig, merchant in Perth, who holds them
     for sale, and of which the subjoined is a correct list.*

  asseveration, Lord Kames had either forgot the date of the battle of which he speaks,
  or had not remembered that Luncarty is in the very heart of the kingdom of the
  Picts, and in the vicinity of its capital.  The battle of Luncarty was fought about
  the year nine hundred and ninety of our era.  Agricola was settled in his camp at
  Orrea, almost on the same spot, about the year eighty, or nine hundred years be-
  fore.  Not a plough known during all this time! ! Credat Judeaus!  Tacitus shown
  us, at great length, the care of Agricola to initiate the Scottish youth in the arts and
  luxury of the Romans; I wonder he never gave them any lessons in agriculture ; the
  more especiall as some knowledge of that art was absolutely necessary to enable them
  to pay the tribute, which, the author tells us consisted of money and corn.  And one,
  cannot help wondering how the Scots could discharge these vectigalia before a plough
  was known among them.  Abernethy  and Brechin still tistify to us, that the Picts
  were great artificers. but thev could be no agriculturists, for a Plough was not known
  in Scotland for three hundred years after the overthrow of their kingdom!!,
