pear absurd, tedious, and laborious, but here is found to be
necessary, and productive of the greatness returns, in regard
that it gathers the ground, and raises it from the reach of
the rising and running water, with coks of which the fields
abound, and which otherwise would sink and destroy the
seed.  The seed sown is black oats and barley.  With the
utmost difficulty, about 40 years ago, the people were pre-
vailed on to plant potatoes, but of which they now plant
great quantities, by the plough and by the spade, and find
them to be the most useful of all crops raised in the parish.
They are sold at from 3s. to 5s. per barrel.  In no season is
the produce of this parish sufficient to maintain its inhabi-
tants, who would often be in danger of suffering through
want, were it not for the extensive importation of meal to
Stornoway.

   Air and Climate.-The air is extremely moist, and the
climate very rainy.  The dampness of the air is so great,
that polished iron, where constant fire is not kept, will con-
tract rust in less time than 24 hours.  The inhabitants of
this island might live in comfortable circumstances, were it
not for the frequent and heavy rains which fall in it all the
seasons of the year, and more especially in harvest, where-
by the hopes of the husbandman are often blasted, and the
fruit of his toil and industry lost.  Such a climate may na-
turally be expected in situation so far to the north, and
surrounded by an extensive tract of deep wet most on the
one side, and the ocean on the other, though no high hills
are here to break the clouds, as on the opposite mainland.
The oldest people affirm, that since their youth, the cli-
mate and seasons are greatly changed for worse.  Never-
theless, the inhabitants are healthy, and live to as great age
as they do in a better climate, some living to the age of 90
or 100 years.
