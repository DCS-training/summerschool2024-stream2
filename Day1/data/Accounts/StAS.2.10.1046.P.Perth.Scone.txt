	   "Agaricus campestris, common mushroom," it is added,
	"grows in extraordinary abundance in Scone Park, interspersed
	copiously with Bovista nigrescens, snuff-box fungus, more sparingly
	with Agaricus oreades, small pale mushroom, interesting from its
	growing in fairy rings, occasionally with the highly poisonous Aga-
	ricus semiglobatus, grey-motted mushroom; and Agaricus Geor-                                       qaricus Geor-
	gii, large yellow mushroom, frequently mistaken for Aqaricus cam-
	pestris, but which from its tough quality, is infinitely inferior for
	the table, if at all fit for it, and may easily be distinguished by its
	yellowish whitegills, and smooth thick yellow stalk." It is said that
	those kinds of mushrooms that are wholesome in one country are
	not so in another.  In great Britain, the Agaricus campestris, the
	A. pratensis, or oreades, and the A. Georgii, are the only roots
	that it is safe to eat, while the A. muscarius and A. virosus are ex-

<FOOTNOTE> + This plant is said to be the frequent cause of black or smut in wheat.
           ++This abundant habitat of Pyrola uniflora is referred to in the Statistical Account
	of Redgorton ; but a wrong description of it is given in consequence of the bridge of
	Isla road having been mistaken for that to Cupar Angus.  The habitat here given
	has been verified by personal inspection.
	   Of this plant the writer remarks, "we regret that we cannot enter into Sir W.
	J. Hooker's arrangement of this plant, in his Flora Scotica, who inakes it only the
	variety B of inflata.  The two plants are dissimilar in every particular.  The flower
	of the maritima is always crowned and cleft beyond the middle, that of the other is
	generally naked and not cleft so deep : the stalk of the former is simple, with not
	more then three terminal flowers, that of the latter forked and man flowered ; the
	root of the former is creeping with long runners, that of the other fibrous; the cap-
	sule of the former is round, that ofthe latter ovate."
	   "The Scottish rows are yet in a very unsatisfactory state.  It is not even defini-
	tively settled what should constitute a species in this genus; but this is the most de-
	cidely marked of the whole, and is the original of all those uncultivated varieties
	known in the Gardens as Scottish roses.  These all retain the characteristic of this,
	of creeping extensively with their roots, which is one of the greatest, inconvenience
	in their cultivation.  The brilliant colouring of Rosa involuto might perhaps reward
	the trouble of similar improvments in the cultivation of that species. "
           Not indigenous in this situation, though it has withstood the severest winters.
