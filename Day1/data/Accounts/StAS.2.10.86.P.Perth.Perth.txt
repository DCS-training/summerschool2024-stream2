the whole arrangement of this valuable estblishment A filtering
well is constructed in the Moncrieff Island, into which the water of
the Tay finds its way through a natural bank of sand and gravel.
From this well it is conveyed in a pipe under the bed of the river,
to another under the great reservoir, which is 55 feet high.  It is
raised into this reservoir by steam engine power, and from thence
it is conducted in pipes through the streets.  It is at the option of
the inhabitants to take it into their dwellings.  The establishment
was got up under the authority of an act of Parliament, and the
expense defrayed by a legal assessment on the real rent of occupied
houses. The assessment cannot be more than five per cent,

                       III.-POPULATION.
   In the year 1562 the population is said to have been 6075,
but the correctness of this cannot be relied on. As reported to
Dr Webster, when he drew up the widows' scheme in 1755, it was
9019; in 1801, it was 14,878; in 1811, it was 17,248; in 1821,
it was 19,068; in 1831, it was 20,016.  The population of the
parish has been of late on the increase, but do remarkable circum-
stance has occurred to which this may be ascribed. There are
three villages in the parish.-Tulloch, containing 193 inhabitants;
Craigie, containing 250 ; and Pittheaveless and Cherry Bank, con-
taining 114.  The yearly average of births for the last seven years
is 502 6/7; * the yearly average of deaths for the last seven years is
603 4/7; + and the yearly average of marriages for the last seven
years is 164 3/7.

<FOOTNOTE>This is the average number of the births that were reported to the session-clerk,
and by him enrolled in the baptism register.  There were 242 children who, during
this period, died unbaptied, and were not reported to the clerk.  Besides, there were
several parents who, from various motives, declined to register their children's names.
It is from there register only the information on the point can be derived.  No satisfac-
tory, conclusion therefore, can be drawn from what is here afforded.
   The number persons reported to the keeper of the burying-ground at their
interment, as having died of Asiatic cholera in 1832, was follows:-in the month
