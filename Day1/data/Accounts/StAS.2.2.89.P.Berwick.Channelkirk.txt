of the parish, first receives the name Leader. From this place, to
where it meets the Tweed below Melrose, the length of the
Leader is about 17 miles.
   Geology.-The hills all seem to consist of rocks of the trap
formation, the strata having uniformly a dip, to south. In the bot-
tom of the Leader are found beds of red sandstone, which is used
for building. Strata of very fine gravel and sand appear in many
places, and are found at considerable elevations on the sides of
the hills. A deep bed of peat is found on the hills, wherever
there is any great extent of flat surface.
                       II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Land-Owners.-The land belongs to eleven different proprie-
tors, the chief of whom, as respects the value of their property,
are, the Marquis of Tweeddale, John Borthwick, Esq. of Crookston,
James Sommerville, Esq. of Airhouse.
   Parochial Register-The earliest date in the parochial registers
is May 30, 1650. They consist of five volumes, and have been
regularly kept.
   Antiquities.-There are but few vestiges of antiquity in the
parish,-a holy well; and a road with the ruins of a house which
devotees used in their pilgrimage to the abbey at Melrose. There
are also on the top of several hills very evident marks of ancient
encampments.
