     Statistical Account

   The people in general are above the middle size.-The ma-
nufactures in the village are weaving, shoemaking, tanning,
dying etc. The manufacturers and tenantry in general have
little or no stock worth mentioning; they are in consequence
moderate in their expences, strangers to luxury, but with the
country in general, acquiring a taste for dress, which, with o-
ther slight symptoms of progress in civilization, will probably
in time be an incitement to their becoming more industrious.
At present the great body that make up the inhabitants of
the parish may be said to enjoy freedom to work or to be
idle; strangers in general to intemperance, their living is
chiefly supplied by the dairy; the manufacturers excepted,
who with a few others, may be laid to be better acquainted
with a meat diet and with the use of beer; which it were to
be wished, could be subtituted for the prevalent use of spiri-
tuous liquors. Education is little valued. And next to the
occupations peculiar to their several lines of life, their leading
object, is to converse and dispute about religious subjects and
church government, concerning which there is a considerable
diversity of opinion amongst them. When time shall have
softened down the keenness and pertinacity generated by this
diversity of religious opinions,-when it shall have rendered,
them tolerant and sorbearing towards those they differ from,
there will be wanting only a general spirit of industry to me-
liorate their condition, and to furnish them with the real and
solid, comforts of life.
