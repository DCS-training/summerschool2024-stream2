     NUMBER XLV.

     PARISH OF FORGANDENNY.

     (County of Perth)

     By the Rev. Mr ROBERT THOMAS.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE parish of Forgandenny has born its present name
from tune inmemorial.  If it ever had nay other
name, it is not now known.  The word is compounded;
Forgan appears to be of Gaelic extraction, for there is a hill
in the Highlands, called Fergan; which, by a small alteration
of the vowel e, into o, becomes Forgan: Denny seems to be
added, to distinguish this parish from the parish of Long-
Forgan, in the east end of the Carse of Gowry.  It is
obvious, that it is called Forgandenny, or Denny-Forgan,
from the situation of the church, which is upon a small hill,
on each side of which there is a den, formed by the perpetual
running of two small brooks, which meer at the foot of the
hill, a little to the northward of the church.  Perhaps like-
wise from the number of dens in the hills.

   Situation and Extent.-This parish is situated in the country,
synod, and presbytery of Perth, about three English miles,
nearly due south, from the town of that name.  It is about
five miles in length, and scarcely two in breadth.  Its whole 
extent is computed to be about 8000 Scots acres.
