tin, 6 Greek, and 8 French. The fees are, for English, 2s. 6d. per
quarter: English and writing, 3s., English, writing, and arithmetic,
3s. 6d., Latin, Greek, or French, 6s., forany two of these languages,
8s., and for all the three, 10s. The probable amount of school
fees is L. 80 per annum. The salary is the maximum. The house
affords more than the legal accommodation, but there is a defici-
ency of garden ground, for which an allowance is given of L. 1, 14s. 3d.
Mr Gray keeps an assistant at his own expense, to whom he pays
L.24 per annum. In 1767, William Law, skinner, Biggar, mor-
tified L. 41 Sterling, and in 1817, William Nisbet, saltman, Big-
gar, mortified L. 40 Sterling, the interest of both sums to be ap-
plied in educating poor children. In 1828, L. 20 were raised by
subscription, and expended in founding a library for the use of the
parish schools. An annual sermon has since been preached in be-
half of its funds, and a small contribution is occasionally made to
them by the scholars. The library now contains 250 volumes.
Some children who live near the east end of the parish are too
remote from Biggar to be able to attend the school, but they are
within easy distance of Skirling, or of a side school at Ellsrighill,
in the parish of Walston. There is an unendowed school in Big-
gar attended by about 50 scholars, and at which the ordinary
branches are taught.
	Literature.--A public library was instituted here in 1797, ano-
ther in 1800, and a third in 1807. The first contains 735 vo-
lumes, the second 503, and the third, which consists exclusively of
religious works, 680 volumes. Their aggregate number of sub-
scribers is 148, and their yearly income L. 20, 6s. A public read-
ing-room was attempted in 1828, but failed after languishing a year.
Newspapers are extensively read. Forty-five numbers of different
English and Scotch papers circulate through the parish weekly.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The poor of this parish were sup-
ported from 1730 to 1746 by church collections, and mortcloth
dues, by the rent of a house and small piece of land belonging to
the kirk-session, by the interest of L. 250 Sterling, which had ac-
cumulated in their hands, and by a legal assessment of L. 100
Scots, on the whole valued rent of the parish. From 1746 to 1760,
there is no record of transactions regarding the poor. From 1760
to 1802, they were supported as during the former period, only
there was no assessment; and the houses and land were sold in l774
and the proceeds gradually expended in aid of the other funds.
In 1802, the assessment was resumed, and has continued ever
since. In 1802, also, the principal sum of L. 250; already mention-
