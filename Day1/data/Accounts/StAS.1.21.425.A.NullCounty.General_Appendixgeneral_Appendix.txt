eel, all of exquisite quality.  The trout, of a large size, taste
very much like those of Loch Leven.  It is very remarkable,
that, in this lake, the trout have not been known to take
the fly, except in a very few instances.  About half a mile
north west from the Manse are to be seen several cairns,
perhaps memorials of some engagement, but there is no tra-
dition; and on a rising ground, not far from this, there is a
stone of about fourteen feet high, and four in diameter.
It stands perpendicular:  and near it are other two of about
the same size lying on the ground.  But as there is no in-
scription upon any of them; and as tradition is silent, I can
say nothing about them.  Near the west end of the lake
there was an extensive inclosure, and there are still some
remains of it, which, tradition says, was a deer park belonging
to Sir Allan Durward of that ilk.  On the south-west decli-
vity of the hill of Formal, near the river Isla, may be seen
the ruins of this gentleman's house.
