     Statistical Account

quarries of excellent free-stone in the parish, the inclosures
are chiefly formed by, stone dykes, the expence of building
which is from 30 s. to 40 s. per rood of 36 yards.

   Rents and Mills.-The grounds, to the distance of an Eng-
lish mile round the town, let at an average of 3 L. per acre.
Fields under sown grass, let for 6 L. per acre, sometimes as
high as 8 L.  There are no less than 11,000 bolls of grain
annually made into meal, at the 4 different stations in the
parish, where mills are erected.

   Roads, etc.-Turnpike roads began to be formed in the
parish of Cupar, only within these few years.  The measure
met at first, with almost-universal oppossition from the adja-
cent country.  The farmers, however, have already entirely
changed their opinion with respect to turnpikes; they pay
chearfully at the toll-bars, and seem, in general, to be con-
vinced of the Vast importance and utility of the roads that
have been formed.  The turnnpikes, in the neighbourhood
of Cupar, are made on an excellent plan, are formed of the
best materials, and contain a hard and soft, or summer and
winter road.-The cross roads in the parish are, in general,
exceedingly ill kept; nor is it likely, that by the statue la-
bour, as at present applied, they will ever be in better order.
As improvements of every kind have advanced so rapidly,
during the last 7 years, it must appear an unaccountable de-
fect, that so very common, and so very useful a machine, as
that of a Still-yard for weighing hay, coals, etc. has never
yet been erected in the town of Cupar, nor on any of the
roads leading to it.

   Wages and Prices of Provisions.-A labourer earns per day,
in summer, from 1 s. to 1 s. 6 d.  In winter, from 10 d. to 1 s.
