   Thomas Blackwell, who was ordained on the 28th of August
1664.  He was called to the charge on the 5th of April 1693,
but his ordination was delayed till the above date, for reasons men-
tioned in the Presbytery records, one of which was his own " un-

Gentle shade! congenial spirits gather round thee ; farewell.  He died 14th March
1782, in the sixty-first year of his age, and thirty-first of his ministry."
