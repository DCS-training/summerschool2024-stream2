or two of coming to its full growth.  None of these
kinds have been seen upon it of late years, however;
at least for 12 years past, so far as we could hear of:
and what made them disappear, or makes them so shy
as to forsake their usual haunt, we are not able to ac-
count for, unless it be, that the ancient art of exagger-
ating is losing ground, and not to be found in such per-
fection now a-days, among the rising generation, as it
was possessed by their fathers.
   There is a considerable quantity of natural woods in
the parish.  They consist mostly of oak, ash, birch, el-
der, hazle, etc.  But the natural plant of the soil seems
to be ash; for both the planted and the spontaneous
growth of it comes to a degree of perfection and size,
that no other tree does, and its quality is, by those who
manufacture it in towns for the purposes of fine work-
manship, allowed to be superior to any thing of the kind
that grows in the Low Country.  This, however, may
be a sign of the poverty of the soil, and the coldness of
the climate; it being a well known fact, that slow growth
makes timber fine in the reed, and hard and durable in its
nature.  In the interior part of the parish, plantations
thrive pretty well, and also in the N. district of it,
which lies upon Lochfine; as appears by that beautiful
grove whuch surrounds the mansion-house of Mr. Camp-
bell of Otter:  but, on the S. point of the parish, where
the experiment has been of late fairly tried by Mr.
Lamont of Lamont, they do not promise so well, owing,
no doubt, to the saline drift that is conveyed by the
storms to every part of that neck of land, from the
ocean which embraces it.
