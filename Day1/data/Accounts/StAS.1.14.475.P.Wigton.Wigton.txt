100 L.; 9 who pay above 50 L.; besides several lesser te-
nants, who subsist not entirely by farming.

   Enclosing.-Till of late, this parish, as indeed all the rest
of the country, formed one continued open.  A few farms,
which were then in the hands of the proprietors, were
enclosed about 50 years age.  But it is not much above
20 years since enclosing became general, during which
time it has been carried on with spirit.  Every farm in
the parish is now enclosed, and most of them divided;
those on dry land with stone walls, and those on the wet
land with ditches.  Even the borough-acres, which, till
of late, were all of them open, and during the winter half
of the year formed an absolute common, are now almost
wholly enclosed; and the hill of Wigton, which contains
about 200 Scotch acres, exhibits between 60 said 70 en-
closures.

   Manure.-It is but between 20 and 30 years ago, that
the spirit of agriculture arose in this parish.  The improve-
ment of land began in the eastern end, which lies nearest
to the shore; and being carried gradually forward, has
now reached the most western extremity.  A few farms,
however, in the western end, are still partly in their natu-
ral state; but as the tenants are now employed in improv-
ing them, they will soon be in the same condition with the
rest, and all the arable land in the parish in a state of
improvement.  In the eastern end, where the carriage
would admit of it, the manure chiefly used was that of
shells, the effects of which are found to be the most last-
ing; but in the western end, on account of the distance
from the shore, lime has been mostly used.  The shells
are brought from the neighbourhood of Crecton, on the
