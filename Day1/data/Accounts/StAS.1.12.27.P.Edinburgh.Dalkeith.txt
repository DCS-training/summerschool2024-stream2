     Of Dalkeith.

great variety of excellent wood in it, particularly a number
of fine vene able oaks of great antiquity; but several of them
begin to experience the effects of time, and are seeming to de-
cay.  The North and South Esk run through the park, and
unite their winding screams about half a mile below Dalkeith
House.  Both these rivers produce fine trout, eels, and some-
times salmon.  The banks are cut into walks of great extent,
with much taste, and are the delight of every visitant.  There
is in the park a considerable number of deer and sheep.  The
situation of the village of Dalkeith is allowed to be uncom-
monly beautiful.  It stands in the heart of a rich country;
the two rivers which run so near it on the N. and S. with
the fine woods on their banks, render it a pleasant abode.
This account ought not to close without mentioning a little
spot of peculiar beauty, about a quarter of a mile from the
village, where an elegant house has been lately built, which
does much honour to the taste of the proprietor.  A situation
more truly delightful can scarcely be imagined.  It com-
mands a view of the pleasure grounds of four of the finest
country seats in the country, of the Frith of Forth, the Fife
coast, the Pentland and Moorfit hills; while, immediately un-
der the windows, the windings of the North Esk are seen in
full perfection.
