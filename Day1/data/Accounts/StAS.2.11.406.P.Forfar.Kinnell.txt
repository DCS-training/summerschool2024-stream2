lifetime of the present tenant, about 547 acres on the estate of
West Braky which, are all arable save about 23, pay only L.108
of money, with 40 bolls of meal and 12 quarters of barley to the
proprietor. * In 1767, the farm of Bolshan was let for fifty-seven
years for L.82; in 1794, it was sublet for L.503; and afterwards,
in 1807, for the remainder of the original lease, for the same an-
nual rent, with a grassum of L.1000. In 1805, the muirside
lands were let to 29 tenants for fifteen years, at an average rent of
L.1, 13s. the acre, and some of them as high as L.3.
   The rental of the whole parish, as far as can be ascertained,
was as follows at the three following dates: in 1736, L.135 Ster-
ling, 226 2/4 quarters of barley, and 718 bolls of oatmeal; in 1792,
L.1334 Sterling, 98 1/2 quarters of barley, and 184 bolls of oatmeal;
in 1837, L.3795 Sterling, 922 quarters of barley, and l69 bolls of
oatmeal. In the rental of 1837, a suitable value is put on such
land as is in the hands of the proprietors, and the surplus rents
which arise from subletting are excluded.
   The largest quantity of land held in lease by one tenant is 817
Scotch acres, all arable save about 23, and comprizes four farms.
The largest single holding is the farm of Bolshan, which contains
573 Scotch acres, all arable. +
   The road money, or commutation for the statute labour, is at
present L.33, 3s., and is paid by forty-four tenants. Fourteen
smaller tenants either pay no road money, or pay it through the
landlord.
   There is a good set of draught horses in the parish; but few
are reared in it. The breed of black-cattle also is good. Of late
there have been two large herds of swine; and there is also a
flock of about 200 sheep, which occasionally range over the waste
land of the parish. Of late also, sheep have been flaked, and fed
off with the turnips upon light ground, but not to a great extent.
In the woods on Monthrewmont moor, there are roe deer and phea-
sants.
   About a dozen of years ago, bone-dust was introduced as a ma-
nure for turnips, `t the rate of about 20 bushels the acre; and
where either the half of the turnip is ate off with the sheep, or
the whole of the leaves are left on the field and ploughed down,

<FOOTNOTE>   The death of the tenant, in 1839, has terminated these two leases.
   + Since the death of the tenant of West Braky, mentioned in the preceeding note,
the greatest quantity of land held in lease by one tenant, is 1380 arable acres, be-
sides about 160 acres of moor, a considerable part of which is now under process of
cultivation,
