   The months of January, Novermber, and December of 1832 are
not included in Dr Rodman's tables.  But from a register kept at
the Gas-works, we find that the barometer varied in January from
29&deg;.4 to 30&deg;.4; in Novermber from 29&deg; to 30&deg;.5; and in December
from 29&deg; to 30&deg;.4

   No rain-gauge was kept in the neighbourhood of Paisley, till 2d
December 1834, when one was placed at Nethercraigs, in this pa-
rish, one mile and a-half south of the town of Paisley, about 160
feet above the level of the sea.  Other two rain-gauges have, in
the course of last year, been set, the one at Orr Square, Paisley,
62 feet above the level of the sea, and the other at Back Thornly
Muir, one mile south of nethercraigs, 693 feet above the level of
the sea.  The results of the first for two years and one month; of
the second for three months; and of the third for four months of
last year, are included in the following table:
