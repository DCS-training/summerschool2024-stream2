belongs to the Presbytery of Shetland, which en-
joys Synodical jurisdiction.  It extends 8 computed
miles in length from S. W. to N. E. and is, in breadth,
from 2 miles to 3 and a half.  Its form approaches to an
oblong square.  The island of Yell lies at some distance
from it, on the S. W. side;  Fethler on the S.; to the N. W.
the N. and the E. nothing appears but the wide expanse of
the German Ocean.  Unit lies in the latitude of 61 degree 12
north;  and constitutes a part of the country and stewartry
of Orkney and Shetland.

   Surface and Scenery.-In comparison with the other
Shetland isles, Unst is reckoned level, yet its surface is diver-
sified by several extensive and moderately high hills.
