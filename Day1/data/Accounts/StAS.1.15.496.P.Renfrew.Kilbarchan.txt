the country, as they say, from pure necessity.  It is remarkable,
that those who formerly went to the sea service, on their re-
turn, generally turned out drunken and dissipated; those a-

industrious.

   Charitable Societies-There are three charitable societies in
Kilbarchan; 1st, The farmers society, which has accumulat-
ed a capital of 850 L. Sterling:  2 d, The general society, con-
sisting of heritors, merchants, and tradesmen, has accumu-
lated a capital of 400 L.:  3 d, The weavers society, has accu-
mulated little capital, from excessive burdens; but has been
of very great use, and relieved much distress.

   Poor.-The poor, in so far as they are not relieved by these
charitable associations, are supported by a voluntary assess-
ment annually imposed, added to what arises from the sessions
funds.  Formerly the poor were supported by church collec-
tions, interest of money accumulated, money arising from
mortcloths, marriages, &c.  But, from the increase of trade
and population, and, consequently, of the poor, these funds
proved inadequate.  In July 1785, the method of assessment
was recurred to, and was levied as follows:  The land paid
at the rate of 3 d. per Scots of valuation, one half being paid
by the landlord, the other by the tenants.  This produced
78 L. 9 s. 3 3/4 d.  There was levied upon the householders, in
the town and country part of the parish 21 L. 10 s. 8 1/4 d.  The
sessions funds produced from 10 l. to 12 L.  The amount being
from 110 L. to 112 L. then levied for the relief of the poor.
The assessment has been gradually increasing, and now a-
mounts to about 140 L. a year.
   This fund is managed by fifteen persons, annually chosen
the 1st Friday of November; five of whom are heritors,
