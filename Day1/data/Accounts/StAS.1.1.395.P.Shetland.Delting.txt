ing of sillocks and pullocks does not fail, may supply his fa-
mily for three quaters of the year. Including farm servants,
there were, in 1782, 364 of all kinds in the parish.  The
number is much the same at present.

   The population of the parish is materially different from
what it was some years ago.  The alteration proceeds from
this obvious cause.  The inhabitants have not been long com-

well as all the rest, is now not enforced; though all of them
appear to have been well calculated for the good police of the
country.  It is said that these regulations were approved and
