     Statistical Account

the parish lies nearly 60 miles south of Edinburgh, and 
18 miles north of the Solway Frith at Port Annan.

   Waters.-The water of Dryfe takes its rise in Lochsell,
at the N. W. corner of the parish of Huntton, and runs
through it about 7 miles.  The water of Corrie takes its
rise at the north march of these annexed parishes, and runs
between them, or along them, about 6 miles, where it joins

but less hilly, less woody, and less rocky.  In sight of
Corrie, the extent of rich pasture and meadow is striking.
But on the heights between these waters, the scene is much

not barren.

the farms of Upper and Nether Hutton, situated within a 
mile of the church.  In the 16th century the learnd and

farms of Hutton answer this description, being situated on
elevated ground rising from Dryse, having several small
hills, and bordered with natural wood.  But how versatile
the meaning of words in living languages! Holt or Hott,
is now diminished to a very small bay cock, or a small
quantity of manure before it is spread.  The word is here

Gaelic.  The water of that name, lets out from a narrow
