Brechin, in the synod of Angus and Mearns, and in the
county of Angus or Forfar.  It may be considered under

west, is about 2 1/2 The general apperance of the district is
flat; but towards its northern extremity it rises gradually,
and terminates in a hill of no very considerable height, called,
the hill of Montrose.  The country in the neighbourhood, being
fertile and well cultivated, affords a delightful prospect in
almost every part of this parish.  A beautiful and extensive
expanse of Ocean; ships frequently failing in all directions;
the town and bason of Montrost; the arches and ornaments
of the bridge of Dun; the windings of the river Southesk,
with the rich fields upon its banks; the charming valley of
Strathmore; a number of gentlemen's feats, and the plan-
tations around them; the venerable steeples of the ancient
city of Brechin, and the celebrated Grampain hills stretch-
ing from the German Ocean, farther to the west, than the eye
can penetrate, must charm every traveller of taste.  They af-
ford also a permanent entertainment, to every inhabitant
of Montrose, who takes a pleasure in contemplating the sub-
lime and variegated works of nature.
