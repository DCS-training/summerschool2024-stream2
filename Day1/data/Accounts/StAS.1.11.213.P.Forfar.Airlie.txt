as much to the improvement of the neighbouring country, as
the other has to the comfort of the poor.  Several thousand
bolls of marl are dug out of this moss yearly, which in price
has arisen, from 4 1/2 d. to 10 d. per boll, 8 cubical feet being
allowed to the boll.  And there are still beds of marl in it
16 feet perpendicular, by the boring iron, and the bottom not
found; but impossible to work out, without more water being
taken off, which will be as difficult as expensive*.  Consider-
able quantities of marl have likewise been found in the mosses
of other proprietors.

*Several very large deer's horns have been found in the Moss of Balrie:
one of which, presented by the proprietor to the Antiquarian Society, weighed
about 24 lb.  There are other two in his possession, one of which weighs about
16 lb. and the other about 14 lb.  In the year 1775, the tusk of a wild boar was
dug up upon a marl spade.  The length of it, from the supposed seat in the jaw-
bone, is 4 inches; the greatest breadth near two.  It resembles very much the
colour and substance of ivory, but is said to be only bone.
