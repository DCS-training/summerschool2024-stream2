   State of Property.-There are 2 greater and about 50
smaller proprietors.  Of the greater only one resides in the
parish.  The rest are mostly feuers upon the estates of Kin-
ross and Arnot.  These almost all reside upon, and farm their
own property.  The extent of these seus is from 100 to 400
acres.  The valued rent of the parish amounts to L. 4515,
6 s 8 d. Scotch.  The real rent of land around the two vil-
lages is about L. 1, 10 s. per acre.-About 900 acres of the
parish are inclosed.  The only sence known here is a
coarse, but cheap one, the Galloway dike.  The lands so
inclosed, let from year to year, at higher rents for pasture,
than, upon a lease of 19 years, for tillage.  The demand 
for such inclosures continues to increase, which begins to
diminish the number of farmers in this district.

   Cultivation and Produce.-There are about 50 ploughs
in the parish.  Of these, 4 are of the Engish, and the rest
of the old Scotch make.  Some of them are drawn by a
horses and 4 oxen, some by 2 of each, and a few by 2
horses only.  The soil being light, easily wrought, and the
greater part of it without stones, the small English plough
would answer best.  The business of farming is not fully
understood in this district.  Turnip and grass seeds, two of
the greatest improvements in agriculture, are only begin-
ning to find their way into the parish.  This is the more
surprising, as the soil is uncommonly well adapted to both.
Their is scarce a farm in this parish, and few in this part
of the country, properly divided, and subjected to a regu-
lar rotation of crops.  The old divisions of outfield and in-
field, and the old mode of managing them still prevail.
The infield receives all the manure which is produced du-
ring the winter,and is cropped without interruption.
From the outfield, after being dunged by feeding the cattle
upon it, the farmer takes four successive crops of oats, and
