parishes.  There is no map of the parish, nor has any regular
measurement ever been made of it.  For this reason, the pre-
cise number of acres it contains cannot be ascertained.

   General Appearance.-It rises gradually from the W. and
S. and S. W., to the E. and N. E.  In both these directions,
it terminates in what may be reckoned high lands, but with-
out any intervening high hill, or mountain.  The face of the
parish is beautifully diversified, by these easy, natural risings,
which slope gently towards the sea.  The summits of many of
them, and particularly of such as are in the more immediate
neighbourhood of the town, were planted by the late Earl of
EGLINTOUNE.  The greater part of these plantations, being
rather more than 40 years old, give a rich and very highly
cultivated appearance to this part of the country.

   Climate, Diseases, and Longevity.-The frequent, and some-
times heavy rains that fall here, are probably owing to the
parish being so very near the sea, and to its situation with respect
to Kintyre to the Islands of Arran, of Bute, and the other
Western Isles.  The atmosphere, by these rains, is often ren-
dered thick and cloudy.  The denser parts of the clouds, how-
ever, being attracted by the high hills on the S. and N., the
air is, for the most part, drier and purer, than in those parishes
which are near or contiguous to these high hills.  The rains,
therefore, which fall here, though frequent, and at times
severe, are not known to produce any malignant epidemical
disorders.  Diseases of this kind are, almost always, brought
into the parish from its intercourse with other places, either
nearer or more remote; and they are even less malignant, or
not so fatal, as in those parts from which they are brought.
From this peculiar wholesomeness and purity of the air, the
inhabitants are, in general, very healthy.  Many of them
