     of Old Cumnock.

And there are other mines now opening in the immediate
neighbourhood of the village.  The consumpt, though pretty
general, is however inconsiderable.  What is used by the vil-
lagers and round the country excepted, it is principally con-
sumed in burning lime stone. Of this, as above said, there is
an inexhaustable quantity in the parish.  The present price of
coals is as nearly as can be guessed, 2 s. 6 d. per ton. The
lime in shells 2 1/2 d. per bushel, five of which are equal to eight
Winchester bolls. And the lime stone, unburnt, 1 s. 8 d. and
2 s. per ton.  All at the coal hills, lime post and kilns; conse-
quently exclusive of the expence of leading.  The Earl of Dum-
fries has also in this parish a blind coal, which he attempted
to export to Ireland.  But the expence of a land carriage of
about 16 miles to the port of Air, obliged him for the time
to relinquish the design.
