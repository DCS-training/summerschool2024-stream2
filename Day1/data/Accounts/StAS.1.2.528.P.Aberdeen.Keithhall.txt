between 10,000 and 11,000 acres, the greater part of which
has been measured.  They extend rather more than 6 English
miles in length.  Their greatest breadth is 5; but in some
places they are considerably narrower.
   These parishes are hilly, but not mountainous.  The soil
varies considerably.  The western part, having a fertile soil,
produces good crops:  But the eastern is, in general, very
unfruitful.  This is partly owing to its exposure to the E. the
N. and N.E. partly to the poorness of the soil, and coldness
of the subsoil, and no doubt, also partly to its elevation, many
of the fields being 350 feet above the level of the sea.-
The air, on the whole, is reckoned falubrious; but not equal-
ly so, being moist and unhealthy near the marshy grounds.-
Inflammatory fevers, sometimes attended with putrid symp-
toms, prevail in the eastern division; and of late, slow ner-
vous fevers, which are more tedious than fatal; and the mea-
sles and small pox occasionally make their appearance.  The
rheumatism and nervous complaints, commonly called hyste-
rics, are not unfrequent; the first among the active, after
violent exercise, or sudden transition from heat to cold; the
second among the sedentary, whose sole occupation is the
knitting of stockings.  The scarlatina anginalis, or scarlet fe-
ver, with a sore throat, was fatal to many, in 1783.  It was
probably occasioned by the badness of their provisions.  The 
schrophula, or king's evil, is in a few families:  Yet it does
not prevent the marriages of those, who are known to be af-
fected with that dreadful disease.

   Rivers.-There are two rivers, the Don and the Ury.-
The Don produces salmon.  The Ury has none, except in the
spawning season.  Pike, eel, and trout are found in both.
The channel of the Don is full of large rocks at Stonywood, a-
bout 5 miles distant from Aberdeen, which would make it ex-
