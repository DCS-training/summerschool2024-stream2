connection of the famous Sir Andrew Wood of Largo.  As
hospitallers, there are 12 old men of the above name, who,
with their wives (if they have any)are accommodated
with a room and closet, with an annuity of L. 100 Scots.
There os a large garden, which supplies them with vege-
tables of all kinds.  There is also a porter, who, among
other parts of hes office, calls them to morning and evening
prayers, which are given by a chaplain appointed for that
purpose.  The surgeon in the parish receives so much a-

money at interest, and an excellent farm adjacent to the
hospital.  The gentlemen who posses the estates of Largo,
Lundin, Wemyss and Balfour, with the minister of Largo,
are patrons.  These meet on the first Tuesday of Sep-
tember, in the hall of the hospital, to examine the accounts
of their factor, to fill up vacancies, &c.  A dinner is allowed
by the founder .  Of this dinner we lately found an old bill
of fare, which shewed the taste of fromer times.  There
was charged for wine 3 s. and ale 10 s.  The charge now
is entirely reversed.
