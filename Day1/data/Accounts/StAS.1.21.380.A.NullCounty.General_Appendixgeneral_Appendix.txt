   If the Society should think any further information neces-
sary from this quarter, their quaries shall be answered with
all the exactness in the power of

     Their very humble servant,

     Observation on the preceding paper.

   What a field for improvement does not this account ex-
hibit?  and, how unfortunate is it, that similar returns had
not been made from every other part of Ireland?  It might
have laid such a foundation for the prosperity of that king-
dom, and furnished such means of occupation to its inhabi-
tants, that they would have had other things to think of
than rebellion, and would have turned with disgust from
those treasonable pratices in which they have lately been in-
volved.  But if any large proportion of Ireland resembled
this district, what else could be expected from a mass of
people, ignorant, idle, addicted to intoxicating liquors, and
without any profitable means of employment?
