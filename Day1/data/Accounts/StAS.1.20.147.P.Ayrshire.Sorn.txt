of the church, in a beautiful holm, having the river on the
front, or south side, and a winding bank, covered with natu-
ral wood, on the north.  About 16 years ago, the late Dr
Stevenson, physician in Glasgow, the proprietor, parcelled
out this holm among several different feuers, for the pur-
pose of building a small village, at the rate of 4 d. per fall
of annual feu-duty.  Accordingly, a village soon arose,
built on the north side of the road to Muirkirk, in one row,
and with a good deal of uniformity.  This village now
consists of 24 houses and 43 families, beside 7 families who
reside in houses on the banks of the river, which, from
the proximity of their situation, may be reckoned a part of
the village, though built long before it.  These 50 families
contain 191 fouls; among whom are 3 shopkeepers, 3 inn-
keepers, 3 masons, 7 shoemakers, 5 weavers, 5 tailors,
4 seamstresses, and 7 colliers; the rest are labourers, aged
widows, etc.  This village is, therefore, evidently the resi-
dence of a large proportion of the tradesmen belonging to
the parish.  It has not, however, added much to the popu-
lation, as most of the same families formerly lived in cot-
houses, which are now in ruins.  Most of these families are
provided with gardens, of various dimensions, behind their
houses, which they cultivate with great care, and raise in
them not only the common kinds of esculent plants, but al-
so strawberries, gooseberries, and currants, and occasionally
flax and barley.  Some of them, too, are very successful in
the management of bees.

   Price of Labour.-About 10 years ago, when the village
of Catrine began to be built, the wages of masons and
wrights were raised to about 20 d. per day; and at that
rate they have continued ever since, with little variation.
In the course of the last 7 years, however, the price of other
kinds of labour has been considerably advanced.  Seven
