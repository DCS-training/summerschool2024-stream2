learn, and which formerly contained no more than fix or
seven families, was at that time laid out according to a re-
gular plan, and now contains no fewer than 200 families.
The houses, many of which are 2 stories high, are in general
covered with slate.  The Ballikinrain cotton-mill was erected
by Mr Dunmore in 1792.  It is constructed for spinning wool-
len as well as cotton; the former for the carpet, the latter for
the muslin manufacture.  This work, at present carried on
under the management of Mr Robert Macmorran from
Douglass, employs about 100 persons, most of whom reside
in the neighbourhood of the mill.  The greatest manufac-
turing work in the parish is Enrick printfield, which was
begun in 1792.  The operative part of the business is car-
ried on by Mr J. F. Moriar, a Swiss, under the firm of
Messrs Monteith, Warren, and Company, Glasgow.  The
buildings are constructed to contain 16 printing presses, to
go by water, and 72 tables for block-printing, besides
boiling-houses, dye-houses, Etc. for executing business on a
very extensive scale.  Every part of the apparatus is new,
and of the most approved construction, especially the wash-
ing wheels, which are not surpassed by any in Europe.  One
of the bleaching-fields, consisting of a plain of 15 acres, is
secured from the inundations of Enrick by an artificial
bank, the raising of which cost a considerable sum of mo-
ney.  Business was begun here in the month of June 1793.
But unfortunately an entire stop was almost put to the
work by the present stagnation of trade, which has com-
municated its baneful influence through all this country.
The whole work at present (Sept. 1793) employs no
more than 250 persons, the most of whom reside in Bal-
frone.
