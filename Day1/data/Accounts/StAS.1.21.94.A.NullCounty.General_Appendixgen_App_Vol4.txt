of eminent physicians upon the continent, copies of which;
in Latin, are to be seen at the end of the 2d edition of his
Treatise on Fevers.  His chief correspondents were Kauff-
man, Tissot, De Haen, and Stoll; the latter of whom de-
dicated a medical work to him, and pronounces him to
be a blessing to mankind.  Finding his health impaired,
he resolved to retire to his native soil; where he devoted
his whole attention to the improvement of his paternal
property, and tendering medical counsel and assistance to the
sick and disabled.  Finding a disorder in his stomach becom-
ing obstinate, he repaired to Edinburgh; where having lin-
gered, with becoming and exemplary resignation and forti-
tude, under a severe illness for three months, notwithstand-
ing the united efforts of the ablest physicians, he resigned his
last breath.-Dr. Grant, in social intercourse, rendered
himself the delight of all his acquaintance.  Never was there
a man who, with so much knowledge, and so much energy
of expression in conversation, rendered himself more plea-
sant in company, or was more regretted when he died.
   Alexander Cumming, son to Mr James Cumming late in
Aviemore in the parish of Duthil, gave striking proofs of
mechanical genius at an early period of life, when a boy at
school.  Being patronised by John Duke of Argyle, he re-
sided under the patronage of the Duke at Inveraray for several
years.  From thence he settled in London, where his inventions
and improvements in the mechanical line recommended him
to the favour of the late Earl of Bute, and the notice of his
present Majesty.  Having, by his merit and industry in the
mechanical department, acquired a sufficient independency,
he now enjoys the fruit of his labour in his villa near London.
