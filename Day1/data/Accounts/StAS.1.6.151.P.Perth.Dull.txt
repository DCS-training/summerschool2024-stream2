proprietor and farmers having been directed to increase the
size of the sheep.  White wool sells at 7 s. 6 d. and wool laid
with tar, at 5 s. or 5 s. 6 d. per stone.

   Population and Distempers.-It would seem that this parish
was more populous about 50 years ago than it is at present.
The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, was 4897 souls*: the
number of inhabitants, as apperas from an exact list of them,
recentlty taken, now amounts to 4676.  The reasons for the
decrease appear to be, that some of the proprietors have ex-
tended their own farms, and that it was considered more bene-
ficial for the farmers, that there should be no farm less than a
ploughgate.  In this part of the country it was usual to halve,
and even to quarter a finall farm, so that, perhaps, three or
four families lived where only one now lives.  In the higher
parts of the country, sheep farms have also been united.-The
annual average of births, for 10 years back, amounts to 80;
but as many of the children, in the more remote parts of the
parish, are baptised by the itinerant ministers, there is reason
to suspect that many names are never inserted in the parochial
records.  The average number of marriages is 40: number
of burials cannot be ascertained, as there is a burial place in
each district; no register of burials is kept.-There is 1 sur-
geon, and 1 family of Roman Catholics in the parish-Rheuma-
tism and pleurifies are the most prevalent dilsempers: they seem
to proceed from the dampnefs of their houses, which in gene-
ral are very bad.  Inoculation for the small-pox has been very
common in this district, and its good effects are clearly seen.

   Rent, Produce, etc.-The valeud rent of the parish is
L. 4898:3 Scotch: the real rent is at least L. 4500 sterling.
