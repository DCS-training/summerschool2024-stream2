about 200 black cattle, and 40 horses annually, besides wheat
barley, and oat-meal to a considerable amount.  The breed
of cattle is greatly improved in size and quality.  Oxen,
after ploughing is over, fell at L. 20, and some at L. 24 the
yoke, for putting on grass-fields.  The breed of draught
horses is also much improved within these 20 years, owing
to the particular attention of Major Aytoun of Inchdairnie,
who sent down from England the best stallions and Flan-
ders mares ever seen in this part of the country.  Former-
ly each farmer kept or bred sheep; but now there are
none, except a few ewes and lambs for the use of families,
owing to the general practice of inclosing with ditch and
hedge and Galloway dikes, and laying down the inclosed
fields with grass-feeds.  Nearly 1800 cattle, including
horses, are pastured here annually.  There are sown with
lintfeed from 80 to 100 acres; with oats and barley about
1200; with wheat above 120.  Potatoes, turnip and sum-
mer fallow, occupy 200.  Oats and peas are sown in March
lintfeed in middle of April, barley from end of April to
end of May.

     Stipend, Poor, etc.-The living is 6 chalders victual, 3
bear, and 3 meal, with L. 40 money.  The countess of Ro-
thes has the patronage.  The church was repaired in 1773.
and the manse rebuilt in 1774.  There are 23 heritors
who pay stipend; of this number 6 are feuers.  The feuers
only reside.-The usual number of poor, including their
children, are between 30 to 40.  They are not allowed
to beg, the parish funds being sufficient for their subsist-
ence, and amount in whole to near L. 40 yearly, in land,
money and collections.

beef is sold at 5 d. the pound, veal, mutton and lamb
