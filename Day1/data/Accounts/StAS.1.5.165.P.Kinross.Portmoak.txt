eighty-five married men, widowers included, have 525 child-
dren alive, which is nearly 3 to each marriage.  Since 1783,
there is an increase in the number of weavers, of 19; and
of population upon the whole, of 6 s.  The increase since
1755 is 109.-The register of baptisms for 10 years, from
1735 to 1745, contains the names of 133 males, and 120
females, in all 253; so that the average number of christen-
ings was 25 3/16 per year.  The same register from 1781 to
1791, contains 192 males, and 114 females, in all 245; so
that the average number of baptisms, for the last 10 years,
is 24 1/2 per year.  The average number of marriages recorded
for the last 5 years, is 6 4/8 per year.  From the above register
of baptisms and marriages, no certain conclusion can be
drawn with regard to the population, at least during the

the children of the Secession not being registered.  In the

The continued encouragement they have received from the
public, is the best evidence that the manufacturers are skil-
ful in their business.-There are 2 villages in this parish,
one of which contains 293 souls, and the other 169.  The
inhabitants of these are mostly tradesmen and manufac-
turers, many of whom are also proprietors of houses and
land.  In these villages there are 5 ale-houses, where great
quantities of spirits are sold; but as yet their bad effects on
the morals of the people have not been very extensive.

   General Character.-The secession from the Established
Church had a considerable effect, for some time, upon the
temper and manners of the people in this and the neigh-
bouring parishes.  Difference of opinion, at first, not only
