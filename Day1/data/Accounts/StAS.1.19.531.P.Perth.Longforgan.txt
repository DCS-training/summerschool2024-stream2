the plough could not reach, loosens the earth about the
roots of the stem, and covers with a fresh mould those fibres,
now making quick progress from the parent root.
   After this, especially if the field be foul, the spaces bet-
ween the drills should be well harrowed with a small har-
row, of a particular construction, already described for drill
crops.  One horse draws it along, and the man who drives
the horse can easily guide it by the handle, and press the
whole harrow sufficiently into the earth, so as to pick up
every particle of couch-grass, or any other fibrous weed;
and when the harrow is so loaded as not to be able to carry
any more along, the driver, with great ease, lifts it up,
leaves the collected weeds or couch-grass behind, to be car-
ried out of the field afterwards, and passes on with his har-
row.  After this operation, the ground is left, until the an-
nual weeds have shewn themselves in full vegetation; but
before the stems of the yarns are too luxuriant, and then
with the common plough, if the drills be wide, the earth is
laid up with one or two furrows, according to the distance
between each, or as the farmer's judgment shall direct; and
afterwards, the whole is finished with a double mould-board
plough passing between each drill:  But if the drills be nar-
row, it generally lays up the whole earth at once, without
any assistance from the common plough.
   When the yams are fully ripe, which will probably hap-
pen sometime in October, and which is known by the de-
cay of the stems and the ripening apples, they are to be ta-
ken up either with the spade or with the plough, and gathered;
but it is a good practice to cut the stems first with scythe, and
carry them off the field, which makes an excellent bedding
in the dung court for a succeeding year; and if the farmer
keeps pigs nothing will be loft, as they will pick up all the
apples, and every yam which may adhere to the stems.  It
has also been remarked by experienced farmers, that if the
