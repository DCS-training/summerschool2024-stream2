taken place in the agricultural state of the parish have been prin-
cipally brought about by Mr Burnett, to whom a third part of the
property in it belongs. Besides greatly ameliorating his land by
draining and fencing in the most admirable manner, he has re-
claimed an immense portion of waste ground, and planted more
than two-thirds of the whole wood in the parish. The very ex-
tensive farm of Haswellsikes, belonging to this gentleman, and
farmed by himself, deserves to be especially noticed, as exhibiting,
perhaps, the finest model of agricultural management which is to
be seen in the County.

   Means of Communication.-The inhabitants have access, by
means of a good parish road, to the market-town of Peebles, which
is not above a mile and a-half distant from the north-eastern ex-
tremity of Manner.
   There are four stone bridges in the parish, the largest of which
crosses the Manner water a few hundred yards above the spot where
that stream falls into the Tweed.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is situated inconve-

lower extremity of the parish, while the other extremity is not less
than eight miles distant from it. The time at which it was built
cannot be ascertained. Though very old, it is in a tolerably good
state of repair. It is capable of affording accommodation for 150
persons.
   The principal part of the manse was built upwards of twenty
years ago. The glebe is thirty acres in extent, and, underproper
management, might be worth from L. 35 to L. 40. The stipend
