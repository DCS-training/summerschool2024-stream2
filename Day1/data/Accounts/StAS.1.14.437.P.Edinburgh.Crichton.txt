     Of Crichton.

"ground by William Earl of Douglas.  It was afterwards
"rebuilt, and part of this new work is uncommonly ele-
"gant."

   Ecclesiastical State.- The church was founded, 26th De-
cember 1449, by Sir William Crichton, Chancellor of
Scotland, with consent of James Crichton, Knight, his
son and heir, for a provost, 9 prebendaries and 2 singing
boys, out of the rents of Crichton and Locherwart:  a
mensal church, belonging to the archbishop of St. An-
drew's, reserving to the bishop the patronage of the prebends
of Vogrie, Arniston, Middleton, and Locherwart.  It is a
venerable building in the form of a cross, the W. end left
unfinished.  It is situated at the western extrimity of the
parish.-Colonel Callander of Crichton is patron.-The 
living is 3 chalders 12 bolls of barley, 3 chalders 4 bolls
of meal, and 451. Sterling in money.  The glebe is be-
tween 6 and 7 acres of good land.  The manse was built
in 1758, and, with a small repair, might be made an ex-
cellent house.

   School and Poor.- The school has been, for some years
past, removed to Path-head, the most populous part of
the parish.  The schoolmaster's salary is about 100 merks:
The fees, is, 6d. for English; 2s for writing; and 2s.
6d. for writing and arithmetick.  He has between 70 and
80 scholars; and his income may amount to 301.- The
poor are supported by the collections at the church door,
the dues on marriages and funerals, and the remainder of
a small stock, which is now nearly exhausted.  Though
assessment is not altogether without disadvantages, it will
be neccessary in this parish.
