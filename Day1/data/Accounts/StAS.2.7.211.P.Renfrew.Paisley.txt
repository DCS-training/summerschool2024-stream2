of wearing the mitre, ring, and other Pontificals.  He was suc-
ceeded by,
   6. John de Lithgow.  His name occurs in the chartulary, in
deeds bearing the dates 1384, 1387, 1388 1408.  Within the
north porch of the Abbey Church is a stone with this inscription :
Johes d. Lychtgu abbas hujus monastii xx die mesis Januarii ano
dm mccccxxxiii elegit fieri sua sepultura.  But it would appear
that soon after 1408, he had resigned his office, for,
   7. William Chisholm is Abbot in 1414.  He was one of the
monks of the monastery, and probably recommended himself to the
Chapter by his activity in the temporal affairs of the convent, in
which he appears to have had some concern during the rule of Ab-
bot Litbgow.  His successor was,
   8. Thomas Morwe, who on 13th October 1420, and 21st April
1421, receives a safe-conduct to pass into England. *  To him suc,-
ceeded the celebrated,
   9. Thomas Tarvas, who died 30th June 1459.  The next abbot is,
  10. Henry Crichton, who was translated to Dunfermline in 1472,
and was succeeded by,.
   11. George Shaw, celebrated as the builder of the magnificent
wall which surrounded the monastery and its gardens, and the
founder of the burgh of Paisley in 1490, when his charter to the
provost, baillies, burgesses, and community of the burgh is dated.
He was a younger son of John Shaw of Sauchie, Stirlingshire, a
family now represented by Sir M. Shaw Stewart of Greenock and
Blackball, Bart.  His life has been written by Crawfurd. (Lives
of the Officers of State, Edinburgh, 1726, p. 367.)
   12. Robert Shaw, another son of the house of Sauchie, and
nephew  to Abbot Shaw, became his successor on his unclogs resig.
nation in March 1498-9.  He became Bishop of Moray, and was
succeeded by,
   13. John Hamilton, the last Abbot, who was appointed by the
Pope, 18th May 1525.  He was a natural son of James, first
Earl of Arran, " by Mrs Boyd, a gentlewoman (says Keith)of a
very good family in the shire of Ayr."  He obtained a legiti-
tion on the 20th of June 1546.  In the same year he was made
Bishop of Dunkeld, and, in 1549, Archbishop of St Andrews.  He
was declared a traitor by the government of the Regent Moray in
1568, for adhering to the; cause of Queen Marv. In 1571, on the
seizure of Dunbarton Castle, be fell into the hands of his
Seizure of Dunbarton Castle, he fell into the hands of his enemies,
