parish are extremely commodious, and even elegant.  They

   Character and Manners.-With the exception of a few
families, the whole people may be divided into two classes,
farmers composing the one, and mechanics and servants the
other.  The former being almost wholly on the same level,
live together in the most intimate habits of friendship and
hospitality.  From the increasing civilization of manners,
the fashion of the times, and other accidental causes, they
have, within the last 40 years, entirely departed from the
pernicious custom of having their meetings for business or
amusement in the public-houses of the parish.  They nor
assemble together in the family stile, and conduct their enter-
tainments with the sobriety and delicacy becoming family
manners.  The morals of the common people have conti-
nued nearly in the same footing for many years.  The only
fact which constitutes a difference between the people of this
rank in this and the greater number of country parishes in
Scotland, is the extreme difficulty of rising above their hum-
ble condition.  The equality of the farms, and the want of
manufactures, afford no hope to servants and mechanical of
