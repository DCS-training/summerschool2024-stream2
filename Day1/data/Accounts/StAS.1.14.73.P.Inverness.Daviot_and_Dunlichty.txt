minister.  In no country are different religious persua-
sions attended with more mutual sorbearance and charity
than in this.  Disputes about religion are scarcely ever
known to exist here; and for our Epescopalians, it is but
justice to say, that while they prosess an opinion, that
has been censured by some as illiberal, they are truly
moderate*.
