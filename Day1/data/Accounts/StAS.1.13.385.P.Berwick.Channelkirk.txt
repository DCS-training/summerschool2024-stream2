derable, being full 6 miles in length, and nearly 5 1/2 in
breadth.  Its figure is nearly circular.  The surface of the
country is in general hilly, particularly to the W. and N.
where the parish is bounded by a high ridge of hills, which
divides the counties of East and Mid Lothian from Ber-
wickshire.  The hills are covered with heath, and all pa-
stured with the old Scotch breed of Black-faced sheep.
The parish is well watered by a variety of streamlets,
which fall from our mountains, the union of which forms
the river Leader, or Lauder.  From the height of the situ-
ation, and the light dry nature of the soil, the climate is
remarkably healthy.  Epidemic and chronic diseases are
unknown.  As a proof of the salubrity of the climate, the 
last incumbent held the benefice 42 years, and his prede-
cessor for no less a period than 52.  The climate, for 6
months of the year, is however extremely cold, subject to
severe frosts, and great falls of snow.

   Soil, Cultivation, Produce, etc.-There are in the parish
from 1500 to 2000 acres of land in tillage.  The soil, as I
have already said, is in general a light dry earth, on a deep
bed of sandy gravel.  It is well adapted to the culture of tur-
nip, potatoes and clover.  The following is the usual rota-
tion of crops on the best land: 1. oats; 2. turnips; 3. bar-
ley or oats; 4. clover etc.  Agriculture has made a won-
derful progress within these last 20 years in this parish.
This, like most other improvements in society, has been
chiefly owing to the skill and attention of an individual.

support of this opinion, and as I find no sach thing in mentioned in Spot-
tifwood's appendix to Hope's Minor Patricks, I am disposed to consider
it is a mere conjecture and am of opinion that the obvious etymology
first mentioned is the best.
