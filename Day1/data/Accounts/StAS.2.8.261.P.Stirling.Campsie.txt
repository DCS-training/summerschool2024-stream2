  In 1618, the stipend was 2 chalders of meal and 600 merks. In
1649, an augmentation of one chalder of meal, and 100 merks was
granted.  The stipend was augmented in 1817 to 18 la chalders,
meal and barley, in equal quantity. There are nearly L.700 a
year of unexhausted teinds. An augmentation of 2 chalders, in
which all the heritors concurred, was, on the 20th of February
1839, sanctioned by the Court of Teinds. The manse is about
forty years old. The old manse, situate behind the present, is
converted into offices. The glebe, is said to be 5 1/2 acres. A
grass glebe of 5 1/2 acres Additional was allocated in 1646;
but, owing to the turbulence of the times, the minister does
not appear ever to have been in possession. In order to make up
to him the want of a grass glebe, a few of the larger proprietors
rented for the late incumbent a park of seven acres.
  Education.--Until the last few years the state of education was
exceedingly low, and the number of persons who could not 'write
or read lamentably great.  This unfortunate state of things is ra-
pidly in the course of being removed, though to remove it effectu-
ally will require great attention and continued efforts for many
years to come.
   The parish school, as already stated, is situated at the Clachan.
Conforinably to an Act of Parliament, 43 George III. c. 54,
the heritors of Campsie resolved, in 1803, to grant an allowance
to two additional schools, to wit, that at Craighead, and that
at Torrance. The salary at present payable to the school-
masters is three chalders of oatmeal, at the average price dur-
 9. Mr John Govan, who had been imprisoned in the Bass, was ordained 5th De-
cember 1688, and died in 1729.
 10. He was succeeded by his nephew, Mr John Forrester, who died September 1731,
aged 25.
 11. Mr John Warden, son of the minister of Gargunnock, was ordained 3d April,
1732. This gentleman was translated first to Perth, and then to the Canongate,
Edinburgh.
 12. Mr William Bell, ordained 24th September 1747, and died 8th May 1783.
Many of the old inhabitants yet remember and speak of Mr Bell, who seems to have
been an industrious and conscientious clergyman.
 13. Mr James Lapslie, succeeded November 27,1783, and died 11th November 1824.
He was a native of Campsie, and, though not without many faults, a man of genius
and of extensive and various information. The old Statistical Account of this parish
written by him, is not inferior to an article in that work. He had an uncommon
flow of natural eloquence; and many of his striking observations are still remembered
and repeated by the people.
 14. Dr Norman Macleod was admitted August 11, 1825, and translated to one of
the Gaelic churches in Glasgow 1836.
 15. The present incumbent was admitted 5th May 1836.
Thus fifteen clergymen have held the living of Campsie since the year 1582, being,
somewhat less than sixteen years each. Of the number--two were translated--five de-
pobed--aud one murdered.
