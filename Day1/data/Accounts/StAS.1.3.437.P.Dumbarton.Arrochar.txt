     of Arroqular.

   General Character.-The greater part of the people in the
parish are Macfarlanes, who have always had, till late, a
strong attachment to the laird, as their chief; and while this
subsisted, misanthrophy and ferocity of manners were promi-
nent features in their character.  Several circumstances, how-
ever have occured, to destroy the influence of the feudal
system in this place.  The military roads, which were made
after the year 1745, opened a free communication with other
parts of the kingdom, and intercourse with strangers.
The consequence of this was, that the mind expanded by
degrees, to embrace, within its grasp, people of other deno-
minations, and to weaken that prejudice which it conceived
in favour of an individual, and a particular clan.  The set-
tlement of some graziers here, from the low country, contri-
buted likewise to produce those happy effects.  They were
at first considered by the natives as aliens, and invaders of
property, to which they had no natural right, being neither
lineal descendents, nor collateral branches of the Macfarlane
race.  Such was their antipathy to their new neighbours,
that they made several abortive attempts to extirpate them.
This, however, gradually subsided, and they lived together
afterwards in habits of friendship.  The sale of the estate
of Arroquhar, which happened some years age, contributed
also not a little to extinguish the remains of that system of
barbarity, which so long retarded the progress of civilization
in Europe.  In proportion as it lost its influence, the manners
of the people changed to the better.  They are now civil,
well bred, honest, industrious, and not addicted to an immo-
derate use of spirituous liquors.
