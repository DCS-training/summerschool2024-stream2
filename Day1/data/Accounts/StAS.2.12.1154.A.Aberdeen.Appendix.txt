  21. Hutton's Bursaries.- Founded in 1801 by MrGeorge Hutton
of Woolwich, who left a large amount of property, both landed and
personal, for the support of forty-eight bursars.  The act of
mortmain defeated his intentions as to his real property, and the

amounting to about L.5000, 3 per cent. red. ann., and yielding a
revenue of about L.153.  On this fund there are now four bur-
sars at L.08, and four at L.16; and L.15 are annually given by
competition under the name of the Huttonian prize.  In the
amount of the bursaries and the arrangement of the prize, the
College has adhered as closely as possible to the intentions of Dr
Hutton.  Patrons the Senatus.
