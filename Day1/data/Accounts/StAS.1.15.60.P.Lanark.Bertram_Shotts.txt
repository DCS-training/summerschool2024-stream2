     Statistical Account

300 L. Sterling goes to the miners.  Hellis Rigg coal, the pro-
perty of Colonel William Dalrymple of Cleland, lies 3 miles
west of Benhar.  The seam is only 22 inches thick; the pro-
prietor here employs 3 miners, more with a view to two
strata of iron stone, of an excellent quality, than to the coal,
which, partly from its inferior quality, and partly from want
of market, sells at 1 s. the cart, the purchaser pleasing himself as
to quantity.  Mr Cleland of Auchinlee, and Mr Cuming of
Cross-hall, towards the West end of the parish, have great fields
of coal upon their lands.  Mr Cleland's seam is upwards of 3
feet thick.  Mr Cuming's in some places is 3, and in other
places 9 feet thick; each of these gentlemen at present only
employ two miners; but did the sale prosper, it would give
bread to a much greater number.  Mr Cuming's coal is con-
nected both with the ball and stratum iron-stone.
   Fuel.-Plentiful as the coal is through this parish, yet, in
the middle, and along the north side of it, peat is chiefly used.
This is almost at every man's door, and is prepared at a time
when, according to the mode of farming here practiced, little
else is done.
   Proposed Canal.-A canal leading from Edinburgh to Glas-
gow was last season the subject of much conversation.  Of the
three tracts proposed, if coal be the leading object, the one
South of the kirk of Shotts surely merits the preference.
Beds of free-stone, some of them of a very fine grain, are fre-
quent in this parish, and the whin-stone in the centre of it
may be said to be inexhaustible.
   Iron Works.-The Omoa iron work, the property of Co-
lonel William Dalrymple of Cleland, lies on the confines of
this parish, towards the South-West.  It was erected in 1787.
The situation of this work is peculiarly eligible.  The Colonel
has throughout his estate here, which is of considerable ex-
tent, a seam of coal 2 feet 5 inches thick; 2 feet above the
