   Ninian's parish, and discharges itself into the Forth, at Hig-
gins Neuck. Stream tides flow in this rivulet a mile or more
from its month.  In time of great rains, it overflows its
banks; if these fall in harvest, it is hurtful to the famers in
its immeadiate neighbourhood.  This small river is between
20 and 30 feet in breadth in many places. and has 5 stone
bridges over it.  One of these is on the public road, leading
from the villages of Dunmore and Airth, to Carron and Fal-
kirk.  It is called the Abbey-town Bridge, which name cor-
roborates an opinion many have entertained, of there having
been formerly an abbacy at Airth, belonging to the Abbey
of Holyroodhouse ; and that this bridge had that name,
from it being the direct road to the abbey town.  It also
appears, from several old writs, that the parish of Airth be-
longed to the Bishop of Edinburgh, during the times of
Episcopacy.  The fish caught in the river Forth are salmon,
herrings, slounders, and trouts.  Cod and turbot are also
sometimes taken.  Salmon are chiefy caught in July and
August, with staff-nets, at the time of low water, and are all
consumed by the parisioners.  Within these 25 years, 300
acres have been gained from the river Forth, and are made good
arable ground.  It is defended from the river by a strong
dike of fods.

   Hills, Coal, etc.-The hills of Airth and Dunmore abound
with free-stone, and the rock, in many places, is within a
few feet of the surface.  The stones are used for building
walls and houses.  There is a fine coal under the rock in
both hills, and in the flat fields around.  The greatest part
of the level free coal of the former was wrought some time
ago; at the present there is no work carrying in, although there
is a great deal of coal still in the ground, which might be
wrought to advantage.  The latter, viz. Dunmore, has been wrought
