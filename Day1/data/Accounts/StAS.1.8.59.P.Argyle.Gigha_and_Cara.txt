is slated, and consists of two storeys and garrets.  It was
built 60 years ago, and is still in tolerable good condition.
Adjoining to the house there is an old chapel, (26 feet long,
and proportionally broad) with a Gothick arched door on the
north side.  This was formerly a burying place, and is now
converted into a kitchen.  Wild spinage and water cresses a-

   Population.-All the inhabitants of both islands are Pro-
testants of the established church of Scotland.  The majority
of them are of the names of Galbreath and M'Neill.  The
former are reckoned the more ancient, and laid to have been
originally a tall race of men.  At present there is nothing
uncommon in their stature.  Tradition says, that there never
was an instance of a shipwreck where three of them were
aboard.  The Galbreaths*, in the Gaelic language, are called
Breatanuich, or Clang a Bhreatanuich, i.e. Britons, or the
Children of the Briton, and were once reckoned a great name
in Scotland, according to the following lines:

     "Breatanuich, o'n Talla dbearg+
     "Uailfe fir Alba do Shloinneadh.
     That is, "Galbreaths from the Red Tower+
     "Noblest of Scottish sirnames."

*Galbreath is a corruption of two Gaelic words Gall Bhreatan, i. e. the
Strange Briton, or Low Country Briton.
This Talla dhearg, or Red Tower, is probably Dumbarton (in Gaelic Dun-
Bhreatain, i. e. the Hill of the Britons, whence, it is faid, the first Galbreaths tame
to Gigha.
