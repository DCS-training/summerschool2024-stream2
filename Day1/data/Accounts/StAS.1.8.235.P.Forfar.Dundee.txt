   So that last year the whole funds of charity, under the ma-
nagement of the Kirk-Session, amounted to to 1083 l. 8 s. 6 1/2 d.
These funds, particularly Guthrie's mortification, will, in a
few years, be considerably increased.  To this, the principal
part of the 4 acres of land, mentioned as feued at 4c l. the
acre, belongs. It is to be observed, that the management and
disposal of all the sessions funds costs not a single farthing
of expence.
   The annual distributions, from funds under the management
of the Town-Council, or levied by their authority, are as fol-

From the hospital for decayed burghers,   L. 130   0   0
From the Guildry,                             46   0   0
Poors rates levied within the royalty,       400   0   0

   This last sum, after paying the expence of levying and
distribution, was last year divided among 120 pensioners-
It began to be levied only a few years ago, for the avowed
purpose of suppressing beggars.  It has not produced this ef-

of the poor, and on this account, has the appearance of jus-
tice, it is liable to many objections.  It tends to impair vo-
luntary charity; it falls as heavily on the most charitable and
liberal, as on the covetous and licentious; by being confin-
ed within the royalty, it takes no hold on the opulent persons
in the country part of the parish, the proprietors of the land es-
pecially, who profit more by the industry of Dundee, than
any other set of men; at the pleasure of any magistracy, it
may be extended beyond all just and moderate limits; and,
being like their other funds, under their uncontroulable dispo-
sal, may be perverted into an engine of borough politics, and
