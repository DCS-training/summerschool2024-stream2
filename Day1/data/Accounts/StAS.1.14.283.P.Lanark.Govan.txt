and the corn and slit mills, in its immediate vicinity,

side of the Clyde.

the great aqueduct bridge, described in the account of
New Kilpatrick, empties itself into the Clyde, at the
Ferry now mentioned, and forms one of the most consi-

course.  From that noble monument of attention to in-
ternal improvement in this part of Scotland, till the Kel-

in length.  Its banks exhibit a beautiful variety of land-
scape, and are entirely covered in some places on both
sides, with wood of different kinds, in a very thriving
state, which has been mostly planted within these 40
years.  Not to mention the public works carried on a-

and printing of cloth; 3 corn mills, 1 for the making
of snuff, 1 for the making of paper, 1 for the grinding

1634, what is now converted into a snuff-mill, had been
used for grinding corn, and is said to have been the first
of that kind upon the water of Kelvin.  The rasp and
chip mills were both erected by their present proprietor,
Mr. John Duncan, in the year 1760, and were the first
in the W. of Scotland.
   Besides these works on Kelvin, there is a considerable
