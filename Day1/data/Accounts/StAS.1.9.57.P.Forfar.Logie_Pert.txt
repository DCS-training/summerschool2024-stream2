The people enjoy the comforts and advantages of society
in a very tolerable degree, though the increase of taxation,
and of the price of provisions, especially with regard to
the poorer class, operates as a considerable abatement.  Se-
veral of the tenants enjoying long leases at the old rent,
which is nearly one half less than what their farms would
let for at present, have in their hands the means of a com-
fortable subsistence, and by industry and frugality may be-
come rich.  But the new leases in general being pretty far
stretched, and the wages of servants every year growing
higher, those, it is to be presumed, who hold such leases,
if they are not extremely active and industrious indeed,
must find considerable difficulties.  Were the wages of ser-
vants rendered in some measure stationary, and greater
moderation observed in the raising of rents, not only might
tenants and their servants be on a more eligible footing,
but landed proprietors would enjoy greater and more perma-
nent security, besides the generous satisfaction of not entirely
engrossing the fruits of honest industry.  Were there pre-
miums allotted by monied men for the improvement of
barren ground, and the melioration of ground already in
some measure cultivated, (the improvement or melioration
to be estimated by an impartial jury,) many beneficial con-
sequences might ensue.
