        PARISH OF

			AVONDALE OR STRATHAVEN.

		PRESBYTERY OF HAMILTON, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR.

			THE REV. WILLIAM PROUDFOOT, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--THE, parish is not unfrequently named Strathaven or
Straven; but Avondale is the proper name. Dale seems to be
much more descriptive of the face of the country than Strath.
There is a considerable town in the parish named Strathaven; so
that now Strathaven is the name uniformly applied to the town, and
Avondale to the parish. I shall speak of the town and parish se-
parately.
	Boundaries, Extent, &c.--Avondale is bounded on the north by
the parishes of Glasford and Kilbride; on the west by Loudon
and Galston and Sorn; on the south by Muirkirk and Lesmahagow;
and on the east by Lesmahagow, Stonehouse, and part of Glasford.
It contains nearly 64 square miles, (32,000 acres,) and yields a rental
of nearly L. 20,000 a-year. The valued rent is L. 7650 Scots.
	Topographical Appearances.--Though lying in rather a high dis-
trict of the country, yet the lands are generally flat, rising gently
from the banks of the river Avon, especially towards the west and
south. There are several ridger and small hills in the parish, such
as Kype's rigg, Hawkwood hill, Dungivel, and the hills on the
boundaries of Ayrshire. There are also the interesting eminences
called the Floors' hills, and the Kirkhill, but these are scarcely
entitled to be named hills. None of tbese heights seem to rise
more than 800 or 900 feet above the level of the sea.
	Climate and Soil.--Upon the whole, the climate May be said to
be rather moist; but it is at the same time healthy. The inhabit-
ants are in general a long-lived race. Many of them at present
living are above eighty years of age, and one is above ninety. Per-
haps in few places is there a finer race of men than in Avondale.
They are tall and stout, and well-formed. There are no particu-
lar diseases peculiar to the district. Throughout the greater part
