   having been made on August 5, 1649, that the elders should
   search the " taverne houses" during afternoon service, " for con-
   temners of the Word," there occurs, on next Sabbath, the fol-
   lowing entry: " August 12, 1649, The elders being required to
   give account of yair diligence anent searching ye taverne houses
   for contemners of God's worship, reported that two of them had
   gone through the towne, and searched, and had found sundrie in
   their awin houses, qubo declared to them that they were pre-
   sentlie going to ye church before yair coming in to them.  The
   sessione, therefore, to the end that the wicked prevaricatione of
   these persons may be better detected, ordaine that hereafter they
   search, not immediatelie at the beginning of ye afternoon service,
   but betwixt ye closure of ye sermone and ye blessing, or betwixt
   ye last prayer and Psalme, that such persons as then sall be found
   may be clearly rendered inexcusable."  One George Ambrose
   having been called before the session to answer a charge of being
   absent from church and " selling of aile" on the preceding Sab-
   bath, appeared on the 16th January 1654, and gave the following
   curious account of the cause of his absence from church :-" The
   said George denyed that he sold any aile that day in tyme of Di-
   vine service, and that the, trow cause of his absence was, that he
   had but ane playd betwixt his wyfe and him, and that she had the
   use thereof that day, and was in the church."  Notwithstanding
   this na‹ve excuse, however, the session " reprove him of his sinne,
   and ordaine him to keepe the kirk in tyme cumand, under ye
   paine of censure."
      Innumerable other entries of this nature occur in these re-
   cords, from which the session appears to have exercised the most
   vigilant superintendence over the conduct of the parishioners in
   the observance of the Sabbath, and to have visited the slightest
   fault with severe censure and punishment.
     These records also contain numerous entries of historical inte-
   rest, such as intimations of fasts on account of national occurences,
   &c., a few of the most curious of which we sball extract.  On thd
   10th December 1648, " the Covenant, and ane publick acknow-
   ledgement of the sinnes of the land, were publickly read before
   the blessing, and a fast for this effect intimated, to be keeped on
   Thursday first and the next Sabbath immediatelie following; and
   the Covenant intimated to be renewed on ye said Lord's day, ac-
   cording to ye ordinance of the Commissione of ye Generall As-
   semblie."-" Aug. 16, 1649.  The same day there was intimat
