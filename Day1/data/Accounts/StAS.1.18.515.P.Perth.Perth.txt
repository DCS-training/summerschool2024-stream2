   Printing Works.-There are 3 printing-works this neigh-
bourhood, some of them only lately established, carried on
by companies residing in Perth, viz.
   Ruthven print-field, in the barony of Huntingtower, upon
the property of the Duke of Athole, carried on by Young,
Ross, Richardson, and Caw.
   Cromwell-park, established on the grounds of Thomas
Graham, Esq. of Balgowan, Member of Perliament for the
county of Perth, under the firm of Meliss and Co.
   And Tulloch print-field in the vicinity, on the property of
the Earl of Kinnoul, carried on by Sandeman Lindsay, and
Co.
   These works at present may be estimated to do business, at
least to the extent of L. 80,000 sterling per annum, and on
the increase, being mostly new establishments.
   The produce of these works, is shipped at Perth, chiefly
for the London market.  The printers here have a full com-

they likewise supply part of the country demand, in England
and Scotland.

mill for spinning twist, by water, the first that was esta-
blished in the neighbourhood; in which Sir Richard Ark-
wright interested himself much in the outset, George Demp-
ster, Esq. and company.  The proprietors have lately built
another mill, which will probably be employed soon in spin-
ning linen-yarn by water.
   There is also a cotton-work for spinning twist, by wa-
ter, at Cromwell-park, under the firm of Wright, Meliss,
and company; and a smaller one at Stormont bleach field,
belonging to Thomas and John Barland.  The operation of
