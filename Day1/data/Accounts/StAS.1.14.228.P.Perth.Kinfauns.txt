Lime, and other manures, come by water, close to the
lands of the inhabitants.  By the same easy conveyance,
their grain is carried to market, and delivered with little
trouble and expense.  But one of the most comfortable
effects of the river, is its furnishing, from the coasts of
the Frith of Forth, a regular supply of coal, which is the
fuel of this country, and which, till of late years, was
brought in plenty, and fold at a moderate rate.  The
usual price was 4 s. the boll, of 56 stones English weight,
or 800 weight of 112 pounds each.  This is the weight
of the boll at Dundee, and in the Tay below Perth
There the boll is only 40 stones.  Within these few
years, however, a most unaccountable dearth and scarcity
of coal has taken place in this corner, as well as in other
parts of the country: But it is to be hoped, that the
late act of parliament, taking off the duty coastwise
will, in time, help to remove this hardship, by introdu-
cing coal from England, on reasonable terms.
