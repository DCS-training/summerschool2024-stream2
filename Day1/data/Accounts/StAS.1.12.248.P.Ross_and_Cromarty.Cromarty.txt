culation, than at the above period.  Of those who took the

   Sea-Coast, etc.-There is a considerable extent of sea-coast
on the N. and S. E. sides of the parish, not far short of 9
miles; that on the N. is flat, and after passing the Sutor Bay
about half a mile, there is scarce a rock to be met with on
either side of the bay.  The coast upon the S. and S. E. is
high, being lined all along with a continued rock, elevated in
some places, upwards of 250 feet above the level of the sea.
There are several fish-boats belonging to the place; and though
this be one of the noblest fishing stations, that can be, yet, of
late years, from the small size of boats made use of, and the
extreme timidity of the fishers, this useful article of life has
been much less plentiful than was formerly known in this
place.  What seems to have introduced the use of such small
boats was, that till within these last 16 or 20 years, fish was
got in abundance within the bay, which is not now the case;
they now begin to see the necessity of large boats, and by go-
ing out some considerable distance down the Murray Frith,
fish are caught in greater abundance, such as cod, haddocks,
whitings, flounders, skait, turbot very rarely, and sole; her-
rings have been caught in great abundance in the bay, but
not for several years past.  The price of fish has risen more,
in proportion, than any other article of life, but still they
are the cheapest provision which a family can use, notwith-
standing that 1 d., about 12 or 16 years ago, would go fur-
ther in the purchase of this commodity, than 1 s. now*.
