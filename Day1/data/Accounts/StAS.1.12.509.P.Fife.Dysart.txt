   Farms in the Hands of Tenants.-These are 15 in number,
containing from 30 to 280 acres each.  Upon these, are 51
men, including the farmers and their servants; 94 horses;
350 cattle; 24 ploughs*; 38 carts.  They breed annually
16 horses, 79 calves.  There are several extensive enclosures
in pasture, on which 100 cattle are fed annually; 339 bolls
of oats are annually sown, which produce 1824 bolls; 101
bolls of barley, which produce 589 bolls; 43 bolls of wheat,
winch produce 351 bolls; 70 bolls of pease, which produce
271 bolls.  Potatoes, turnips, hay, and flax+, are also raised
in no great quantities; and the proportions cannot be easily
ascertained.  The rent of the best grass-ground in the burgh
acres is, 2 L. 15 s. the acre:  of the best arable land, 3 L.  In
the farms, there is little above 1 L. an acre; and much below
it.  There is a considerable extent of ground not above 7 s.
6 d. the acre.  The leases being only for 19 years, is against

service to the publick.  The produce of the parish goes but
a little way to supply its consumption.  Meal and flour are im-
ported from Lothian; meal, wheat, barley, and hay, from
the neighbouring parishes.  Little manure can be got but
lime, which is used in considerable quantities.  For some
