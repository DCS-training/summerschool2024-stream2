of Roxburgh has by far the largest portion.  None of the
heritors but one reside on their property in this place.

   Population.-As the increase of the village is supposed
to be equal to the depopulation of the country part of the
parish, when small farms were annihilated, the present
number of inhabitants is supposed to be nearly the same as
in the return made to Dr Webster in 1755, which was
then 789.

   Agriculture.-Little more than one fourth part of the
parish is at present under culture.  It is certain, however,
from the traces of the plough which yet remain on the
higher grounds, that much more of this and the adjacent
country was anciently under tillage than at present.  It is
generally believed, that, during the long and cruel contest
between the two kingdoms, a great portion of the lands on
the borders were kept under white crops, as it was not so
easy for the plundering parties, in these unhappy times, to
carry off crops of grain, as it was, had the land been in
pasture, to drive away the cattle.  The drill turnip hus-
bandry is carried on here with great spirit, and is consider-
ed as one of the chief improvements of agriculture in this
country.  Large fields of turnips are purchased by the gra-
ziers for feeding off with sheep.  The very small quantity
of lint that is produced in the parish is mostly dressed or
scutched by the hand at the owner's houses.

   Manufacturers.-Artisans and tradesmen are far from
being numerous in the parish, there being no more than are
necessary to supply the inhabitants in customary work, in
which are employed 4 weavers, 6 wrights and joiners,
2 smiths, 3 masons, 5 tailors, 1 shoemaker.  Tailors con-
tinue the practice of working in their employers houses,
