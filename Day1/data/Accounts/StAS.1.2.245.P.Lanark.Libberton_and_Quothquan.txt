     of Libberton.

   Property in land has not undergone many changes, as will
be seen in the following facts:  In the 11th century, this pa-
rish belonged entirely to two portioners, viz.  the ancestors of
the present Lord Sommervelle, and of Mr Chancellor, of
Shield-hill; both of whom came from Normandy, with Wil-
liam the Coqueror, in the year 1066.  After the battle of
Hastings, not being provided for in England, they were sent

improvements, on either the lands or villages.  But there is
reason to believe, that Lord Marr, passed a considerable part
of his time in Libberton.  For there is still to be seen, within
the distance of 300 yards of the present church, the vestige of
an old house, called Marr's walls (probably those of a hunting
house;) and many other parts of the lands, about the vil-
