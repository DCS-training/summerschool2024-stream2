not knowing, or not attending to this regulation, made an
attempt to be admitted, without discovering who he was,
but was refused by the porter.  Upon returning to the inn
at Carron, he wrote the following lines upon a pane of
glass in a window of the parlour into which he was shown-

     We cam na here to view your warks,
     in hopes to be mair wife:
     But only, lest we gang to hell,
     it may be na surprise.

     
     But when we tirl'd at your door,
     your porter dought na bear us;
     So may, should we to hell's yetts come,
     your billy Satan fair us*.

*William Fullarton, Esq; of Fullarton, in the county of Ayr, North
Britain, has obtained a patent for making cast and malleable iron after a
new method.  He calcines the iron stone or ore, if it be necessary, redu-
ces it to powder, bolts it, separates the extraneous matter, and then puts
it into a furnace, along with a sufficient quantity of coke, or charcoal.
The furnace is intended to act as a crucible; and the metal, when fluid,
is not to be drawn off, and car into pigs, but is to remain as a loop at the
bottom.  When it is taken out thence, it does not require to be melted
again, but after being heated may, without any other process, be beaten
into bars.
   The principal advantages, which appear to attend the method pro-
posed by Mr Fullarton must arise from his manner of preparing the
iron stone or ore, and from permitting the metal to cool gradually in
the furnace; to which may be added the removing of the flag, which he
takes care to do while the fusion is going forward.  From the s0pecifica-
tion which he has given, it seems as if pulverising the iron stone or ore,
and freeing it of extraneous matter, precludes the necessity, and saves the
expence of using limestone as a flux; and cooling the metal gradually,
prevents that brittleness which cast iron and steel posses when they are
cooled on a sudden; and thus the loop is in a better state of preparation
for being put under the hammer.
