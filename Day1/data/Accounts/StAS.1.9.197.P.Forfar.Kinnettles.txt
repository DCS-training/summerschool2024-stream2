     NUMBER XV.

     PARISH OF KINNETTLES,

     (County or FORFAR, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS,
     PRESBYTERY OF FORFAR.)

     By the Rev. Mr DAVID FERNEY.

     Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, Air, etc.

   The name is of Gaelic derivation, and signifies "out
from the bogg."  This name applies with peculiar
propriety to the old mansion-house of the estate of Kin-
nettles, which was built close to a piece of marshy ground,
still called the Bogg The church being built within the
boundaries of this, estate, that circumstance probably gave
the name of Kinnettles to the parish.  The form of the
parish is nearly a square, having about 2 English miles
for the length of each of its 4 sides.  The south line or
boundary seems, however, to be rather shorter than any
of the other three.  The parish is divided by a hill, one
part of which is called Brigton, the other Kinnettles.
The hill is arable, except a few acres of rocky land on

<FOOTNOTE>

*The mansion-house is now removed about a furlong farther from the
marsh.
