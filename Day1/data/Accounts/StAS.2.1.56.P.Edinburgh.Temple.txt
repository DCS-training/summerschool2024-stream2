poor, including two lunatics, is about L. 80. The average num-
ber of persons receiving aid, exclusive of them, is from 16 to 18.
The annual amount of collections at the church door may be about
L. 7; and a small sum is raised from mortcloths, probably about
L. 2 yearly. To cover the expense of the poor, however, it has
been found necessary to raise an assessment, which is laid in equal
parts upon the heritors and their tenants.
   Inns, Alehouses, &c.-amount to five or six, and they are attended
with the usual bad consequences on the morals of the people.
   Fuel.-Coal is procured from Vogrie in this parish, Arniston in
Cockpen, and Barleydean in Carrington; none of these places
above four miles distant. The price varies at the several collieries
from 1s. 3d. to 1s. 10d. per tub of four cwt.

of Cranston; on the south, by Borthwick; and on the east, by
Fala and Humbie.
   Topographical Appearances.-The ground in this parish and
neighbourhood is remarkable for its undulating nature; hill and
dale following each other in almost unbroken succession. It
may be remarked, that these inequalities have been becoming more
strikingly apparent for some years back; in several instances,
indeed, new irregularities of the surface are observable, and spaces
of whole acres are visibly sinking from their former level, and form-
ing large hollows, which but a short time ago could scarcely be
noticed.
   The river Tyne takes its rise in the upper part of the parish, and,
holding a northerly direction for two or three miles, at last flows
