<FOOTNOTE>

*There is no bill of mortality kept in the parish; but, from
the account of the mort-cloth dues, the average number of
deaths, for these 3 years past, is 45 yearly, buried at the parish
church, besides those buried elsewhere, which may be reckoned
about 15 more. The average of marriages, for the same pe-
riod, is 36 yearly. Thee births are not all recorded; some pa-
rents neglect it to save the expence, and some, from religious
scruples against the tax. The average number of baptisms, re-
corded for the last 3 years, is 96 per annum, but it is supposed.
that 20 more yearly are not recorded.
