ed and esteemed for their civility, and hospitality to stran-
gers.

   School.-In the great extent of this parish, as hath been
already observed, there is no school but the parochial, by
which means the rising generation suffer much, and are
wholly neglected, having no access to the benefit of instruc-
tion.  There are only two catechists, who have their ap-
pointments partly in the skirts of this and partly of the
two neighbouring parishes.

   Church.-All the people of every denomination are of the
established church; there are no Dissenters, Seceders, nor
any other kind of fect whatever in the parish.  The church
of this parish has stood more than a century, but has for
some years past been in a ruinous situation; and was there-
fore taken down this summer, and a new elegant church is
building.  There are three places of public worship in the
parish, exclusive of the church, viz. Kenlochew, Chapel of
Sand, and the crost of Jolly.  The church and manse are at
the distance of six English miles from each other.  The
manse is very near the shore on the north of the church,
and supposed to be in the centre of the parish.  The value
of the living, exclusive of the glebe, and including the ex-
pence allowed for communion elements, is only L. 58:6:9 1/2.
There are five heritors in the parish; viz. Sir Hector
M'Kenzie of Gairloch, Baronet, John M'Kenzie of Gruin-
ord, John M'Kenzie of Lotterew, Roderick M'Kenzie of
Kernfary, and Colonel M'Kenzie of Coul, who is at present
in the East Indies; all the rest reside in the parish.

   Rent.-The land-rent cannot be ascertained with accuracy.
It may probably be about L. 1700 per annum.
