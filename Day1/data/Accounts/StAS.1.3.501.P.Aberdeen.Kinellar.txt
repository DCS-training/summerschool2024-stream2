clerk, 20 L. Scotch a year; with 6 s. 8 d. Scotch for each
baptism, and 10 d. Sterling for each marriage.  The wages
paid by the scholars are, 1 s. 6 d. Sterling a quarter for Eng-
lish and writing; 1 s. for English alone; and 2 s. for Latin
and arithmetic.  The medium number of scholars is 30 in
winter, and 16 in summer.  The parish has at present an
excellent schoolmaster.

   Population and Diseases.-The great body of the inhabi-
tants consists of farmers, with their families and servants.
As no manufactures are carried on, there are few mechanics,
and no villages.  Too many cattle, indeed, are kept in this
parish, to admit of its being a thriving nursery of the human
species.  Not that it is much afflicted with dangerous distem-
pers; although inflammatory and putrid severs appear occa-
sionally.  In autumn 1790, a complication of fever and rheu-
matisn, which, on the third day, brought on a delirium, pre-
vailed in the parish; but scarcely any died of it.  The circum-
stance chiefly inimical to the incerase of its population is,
that, as a few hands are sufficient for the management of
black cattle, the rest go elsewhere for employment, as they
grow up.  Even the inclosures, in many respects so benefi-
cial, are, in one instance, unfriendly to population.  Boys
and girls were employed to tend cattle, while seeding in the
open fields; but in grass parks, a cow-herd is hardly necessa-
ry.  This is one cause of the great decrease of inhabitants
within these 30 years, which amounts to nearly one fourth
since 1765.  the decrease since 1755, however, is not so
great, being only 56, or about one seventh on the whole; as 
the return to Dr Webster, on that occasion, was 398.  The
table here subjoined, exhibits an accurate state of the popu-
lation of Kinnellar, for these last 34 years.
