with his buyers, whether it be wool, cattle or sheep; Ber-
wick being on the straight road to Morpeth, Sunderland and
Shields, the great marts of our stock; and Yorkshire, in the
same way, for our wool; the jobbers in these different articles
repair thither at particular seasons, and carry off whatever we
have to part with.  'Tis difficult then to say, what would melio-
rate the situation of the inhabitants of this parish.  Fuel pre-
sents itself as the readiest means of making their state more
comfortable.  At present they are, 'tis true, 7 miles from coals;
but as it is good road, and the tenants drive so many loads to
each cottager, this inconvenience is the less felt, more espe-
cially as the prime cost is very moderate.  But there is a rea-
sonable hope that even this drawback may shortly be remov-
el; as there is no doubt, that, on the northern extremity of
the parish, there is a workable coal, which, it is understood,
the proprietor intends ere long to open up, and which will be
of the greatest benefit to the parish, as well as to the neigh-
bourhood.

   Character.-Actuated by a sense of these advantages, the
inhabitants of this parish are industrious, frugal and orderly,
submissive to the laws, and attentive to the wish of their su-
periors.  No inhabitant has been convicted of a crime be-
fore a Court of Justice, in the memory of man.  And what
shews the regularity of their conduct in the most conspicu-
ous light, is, that in July 1792, when the most atrocious riots
prevailed in this county, on account of the institution of
turnpikes, not one inhabitant of this parish was carried be-
fore a magistrate, or even suspected of being concerned in
those shameful enormities which disgraced the county:
though perhaps the burden, (if there be any,) falls heaviest
on them, being situated at the eastern extremity of the coun-
ty, and though they, who pay toll, do not travel ten yards on
the road, on their way to Berwick.
