lands.  A few farms to the east, on the march of Middlebie,
and a few to the north, on the march of Tundergarth. have
not the same explosure, but the soil is the same.  On the 
west side of the old parish of Line, a considerable tract of
land lies waste, the most of which could not admit of cul-
ture; but, excepting this and a few other places, all the ld
in the present parish of Hoddom is arable; and, indcet, the
greatest part of it has actually been ploughed.

   Inclosures and Produce.-About 22 years ago, not a fence
or dyke of any kind was to be seen in the whole parish.
Now, almost every farm is surrounded with a good fence,
either of stone or hedge, mostly of the latter; and several
farms are divided into parks or inclosures  The grain crops
are principally oats and barley.  In some particular spots, 
wheat may be seen; but to little of it, as not to deserve
being particularly mentioned.  The mode of culture com-
monly adopted is, first, manuring the land with lime,
when that is judged necessary, then breaking the ground,
and taking from it two crops of oats successively; then
manuring the land with dung, and taking from it one
crop of barley; then taking from it other two crops of oats;
and, after that, suffering the land to rest for about four years.
This is the method which is commonly followed; but there
are individuals who pursue a different method, and lay out
their fields both with judgment and taste.  The quantity of
grain. produced in the parish, greatly exceeds that which is
consumed by the inhabitants.  1700 Carlisle bushels of bar-
ley, 400 Carlisle bushels of oats, together with 3500 stone
weight of oat-meal, are computed to have been, for these
three years past, carried out of the parish annually, at an
average.  Some of this barley is exposed to Greenock, but
the greatest part to Lancashire and Cumberland.  It must
