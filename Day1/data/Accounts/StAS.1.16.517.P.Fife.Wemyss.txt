the scarcity and high price of fish.  Twelve boats, with
6 men in each, used in the month of August, to go from
this parish to the herring-fishing off Dunbar; but the en-

late amiable and worthy predecessor, the Rev. Dr Harry
Spens*, when minister of this parish, (dated Wemyss, 20th
August 1778), from which the following particulars re-

"threescore years past, they have had the character of a
"sober and sensible, an industrious and honest set of people.
"The only singularity in their ancient customs that I re-
