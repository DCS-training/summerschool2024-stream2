and about a quarter of an acre of pasture ground.  In 1763
there was an augmentation of 1061, Scotch.  The College
of St. Andrews are titulars of the teinds, and draw a consi-
derable sum yearly from the parish.

   School.-The parochial school is small.  The number of
scholars, in winter, is from 20 to 30; but does not exceed
14 or 15 in summer.  The salary is only 5 L. 12 s.  The
perquisites are trisling.  Till within these 9 years, there was
no legal salary.

   Population.-The return to Dr Weber, in the year 1755,
was 383; from which it appears, there is a decrease of 31
within these 40 years.

   Cattle.-The number of black cattle seldom exceeds 650.
That of the horses, in January 1792, was 94.  Both were
included in the former calculation.

   Disadvantages.-The high duty on malt is severely felt in
this parish.  This tax amounts to nearly one third of the
value of the bear, which operates almost as a prohibition of
the manufacture, and of consequence, not only distresses the
country people, by depriving them of a necessary and
strengthening refreshment, but likewise hurts the revenue,
by diminishing the consumption.  There is hardly one fourth
of the quantity of malt made now in the parish, that was
made in it 20 years ago;  which is attended with this addi-
tional bad consequence, that the people, being deprived of
their usual wholesome liquor, are obliged to have recourse to
spirits, which are sold through the whole country, to the no
small hurt of their health, as well as their morals.
