the ground may be in sown grass and pasture, about 100
acres in growing woods and planting, and there may be
200 acres of commonly belonging to the town, to which
the burgesses may send their cows or horses for about 7 s.
a year.  The parish does not supply the tenth part of the
provisions consumed in it.  Great quantities of corn, meal 
and butter, are imported from ireland, and of cheese from
Ayrshire.  Eggs are generally sold at 4 d. the dozen, butter
9 d. the pound, beef 6 d. mutton 6 d. hens 1 s. each.

reaped the end of August, September, sometimes not till the
beginning of October.  Barley is sown the end of May, or
beginning of June, and reaped in August or September.

a-year.  Small parcels of lands are often transferred.  A
piece of ground of four acres, lately sold here, brought a
price of L. 472; but that was a singular case.

deepening the Clyde, and 1 1/2 d. cartage from th quay, total
4 s. 9 1/4 d. Peats are dear, 2 s. the small cart, and only used
