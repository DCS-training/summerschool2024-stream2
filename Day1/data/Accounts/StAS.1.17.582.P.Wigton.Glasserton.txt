covered with heath.  The lower tracts lying among them are
marshy.  The soil is usually loam, gravel, peat-earth, or clay.
Granite and schistus compose for the most part, the strata
of the rocks.  Yet, beds of that mixture of carbonated lime
and clay, which is known by the name of marl, have been
here ant there discovered; and the marl has been dug for
manure, till the pits are now nearly exhausted.  The sea
beach exhibits no such diversity of the exuviae of marine
animals, as might prove very interesting to the lover of con-
chology.  The ordinary indigenous grass form the com-
mon sward of the pasture-grounds.  At the sea-shore, the
rocks rise over the waters, with a bold, abrupt, beetling termi-
nation of the land.  Little native unplanted wood is to be seen
within the parish.  Furze and wild shrubs are more plenti-
ful.  The general course and temperature of the weather are
variable, but mild.  The genial influence of spring is com-
monly felt here, as around all there western coasts, somewhat
earlier in the year than in the interior parts, or on the east-
ern side of the kingdom.  Frosts are rarely intense or long
continued: Snow seldom accumulates to a great depth, or
lies long upon the ground.  Some small streams, and many
springs, serve to water the parish; but it is neither bounded
nor intersected by any great river.  Upon the rock within
the sea-mark, at a place called Monreith, there grows a con-
siderable abundance of those manure plants, which are fre-
quently burnt for the sake of the kelp or alkali of their ashes;
but little of that species which are employed in agriculture,
as a rich manure, is to be seen on this part of the coast.

   Wild Animals.-The fox, the weasel, the otter, the hare,
the mouse, the mole, are almost the only species of wild four
footed animals now remaining in this parish.  The adder is
the only formidable reptile.  The wild sowls are numerous,
