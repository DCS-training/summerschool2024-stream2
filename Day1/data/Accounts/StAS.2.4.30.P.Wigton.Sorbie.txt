			III.--POPULATION
	From the records of the synod of Galloway it appeared that, in
1697, population of Sorbie was 480. In 1755, it was 986.

<TABLE>
The amount of population as shown by the census of 1791, was 1071
						   1801,     1091
 		   				   1811,     1265
						   1821,     1319
						   1831,     1412
   	        The number of males being 656, females, 758
	The gradual increase of the population is to be attributed
mainly to improvements in agriculture and shipping, but it must
be observed that, within the last forty or fifty years a considerable
number of Irish families have
 settled in the parish, and have con-
tributed to augment the labouring classes beyond what these
causes could have otherwise effected. Their existence in the pa-
rish is therefore to be attributed more to their capacity of subsist-
ing on an inferior scale of comforts, than to the healthy stimulus
of an increase in the means of subsistence.
