very rich and beautiful prospect opens to our view; viz.
well cultivated fields, inclosed either with stone-walls, or
with thorn hedges and belts of planting.  In short, every tra-
veller is struck with the natural beauty of the country, which 
of late years has been so much improved by art, as must give 
a favourable idea of the good taste and opulence of the pro-
prietors.  The gentlemen's houses are large and commodi-
ous, and their gardens well stored with fruit-trees.  About
eighty years ago, there were few forest trees to be seen here, 
except some natural alders and willows onthe banks of
rivers, and a few ashes, elms, and limes, surrounding gentle-
men's gardens; but now there are extensive plantations of
pines or firs, several miles in circumference, besides many
thousands of oaks, and other hard wood of every kind that is
to be met with in North Britain.  The several proprietors
seem to vie with each other raising the finest plantations
of timber.  Such improvements are desirable on a double
account:  They adorn the face of the country, while they
promote the interest of individuals.

   There are several hills in this parith, which being viewed
from the plains below, add much to the grandeur and variety
of the prospect.  Several of these hills are covered with fir
plantations, which cannot fail to please the eye, as, the
hill above Foulis, the hill of Swordle, and some others.
Knockmartin, a small hill, compared to the rest, is situated
on the east side of the hill of Swordle, and is seen from the
sea side.  Its chief beauty consists in its shape, it tapers gra-
dually from the base to the highest point, forming a cone.
This last mentioned, as well as the higher hills beyond it, are
covered with heath.  But the most distinguished hill in the
parish is Ben-yaish, which towers above all the left; and
must be extremely high, as it is seen in Moray and Banff-
