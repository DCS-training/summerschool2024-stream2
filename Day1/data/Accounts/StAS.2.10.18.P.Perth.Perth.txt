   The absolute quantity of moisture which exists in a vaporou\ps
state in the atmosphere, depending chiefly upon the temperature,
is greatest, as might have been expected, in the month of July,
and least in January. The month of April appears to possess the
smallest relative humiditx, and is therefore, in the ordinary accep-
tation of the expression, the driest month of the year; while the
month of November is the dampest. The mean hygrometric state
of the air, at Perth, appears to be when the atmosphere is charg-
ed with .805, or about four-fifths of the entire quantitx of mois-
ture it is capable of holding in solution at the mean temperature.
   The coincidence between the point of deposition and the mi-
nimum temperature of the night, so well exemplified in the above
table, is a result that might have been anticipated from the gene-
ral principles of hygrometry; but it was first established by Dr
Anderson that the quantity of moisture existing in the air, over
any district, operates as a check upon the diminution of tempera-
ture,-the transition of the aqueous vapour to the liquid form
causing its latent, caloric to assume the sensible state, and thus ef-
fectually counteracting the tendency of the cooling processes to
which the nocturnal air is exposed in the absence of the sun.
This fact, so important in meteorology, affords a fine illustration
of the reason why the windward sides of continents and extensive
islands are warmer than their leeward sides in the same parallel
of latitude; and why dry and parched tracts of land are always
found to be liable to severe cold during the night. *-See Edin.

<FOOTNOTE>Sir David Brewster has endeavoured,,with much ingenuity and some appearance
of plausibillty, to establish a relarion between the magnetic poles and the poles of
greatest cold, which, like the former, be conceives shift their position on the surface
of the earth according to some secular law of variation. He has accordingly pro-
posed an equation, which has the merit of expressing the mean temperature of a
place with considerable accuracy. It must not, however, be regarded on that account
as confirming the hypothesis; but merely as an empirical formula, which embraces
