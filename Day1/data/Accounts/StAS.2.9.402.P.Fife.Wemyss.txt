   Poor's Funds.-Captain Wemyss, the sole heritor of this parish,
some years ago wisely agreed to give L.40 a-year in aid of the
funds, in order to avoid a legal assessment. His annual payments,
however, have hitherto considerably exceeded that sum.

In 1833 they amounted to         .           .            .      L.60    0   0
