allum stone.-Not far distant from Staxigoe there is a good
state quarry, though not so light for roofs as the Easdale
state.-Near Cartie Sinclair, and not far from the surface of
the ground, considerable pits of emery have been discovered,
which, when properly pulverised, promises to resemble in
quality that article commonly brought from other countries.
On the surface of the emery pits, a very fine smooth clay, or
ochre of a bright yellow colour, is found, which, mixed with
a little glue, answers well for painting the walls of rooms,
etc.-The language generally spoken in Wick parish is the
common provincial dialect of the north, which they pro-
nounce with more propriety, and less of a peculiar tone, than
in many other parts of Scotland, and which, making some
allowance for a few words and phrases peculiar to the native

wolves; or from a person called Wolf (no uncommon name
in the northern parts of Europe,)having possessed it.
Thrumster, Stemster, Thurster, Bilbster, Sibster, Nybster,
Wester, etc. sufficiently prove how general that termination
is.-In this parish, and throughout the county in general, a
number of Pictish houses are interspersed; in some of which
are found wells or good springs of water, pieces of iron,
deer's horns, and, in some hillocks, a number of small pieces
of silver) and sometimes copper coins of James I. etc. of no
