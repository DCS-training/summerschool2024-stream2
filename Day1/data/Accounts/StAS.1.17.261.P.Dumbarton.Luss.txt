   The profit arising from such a stock, seems inadequate to

sheep farms, there are some low arable and grass grounds,
the produce of which, in estimating their value, is seldom
taken into the account.  Much depends upon the times, and
much upon management.  In the event of a severe winter
or spring, the number of lambs for sale falls often one third
short of the foregoing statement.  The disease called braxy
is at times very destructive to them, though not nearly so
much so of late, as when the grounds were first laid under
sheep.  It seldom attacks any but the lambs or hogs, i. e.
yearlings.  Wedder lambs are more subject to it than ewe
lambs, and the fattest and best frequently fall a sacrifice to it,
when the lean escape.  It is most fatal to them on a change
of weather from frost to thaw, or thaw to frost, but especially
during hoar frost.  In open winters few suffer by it.  Taking
care that the pasture is neither too rich nor too poor, is rec-

the pasture immediately, the most effectual way of curing it.
