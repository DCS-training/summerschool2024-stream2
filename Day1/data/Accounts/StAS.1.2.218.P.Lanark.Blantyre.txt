few beans, barley, and wheat are also raised; but the quanti-
ty of these kinds of grain is but small, when compared with
oats.  Potatoes are also cultivated by almost every family,
whether of farmers or labourers, for their own subsistence;
and the practice of feeding cattle with them is become pretty
general.  Of late, more attention begins to be paid to the po-
tatoe crop; because a ready market is found, for a considera-
ble quantity, at the cotton mill.-The old Scots plow is
almost universally used.-There are few sheep kept in the pa-
rish, not much exceeding 100.  Flax is seldom raised, in any
greater quantity, than what the farmer thinks sufficient for the
use of his own family.  A very considerable quantity of rye-grafs,
and clover hay, is cultivated in the parish, and carried to Glas-
gow, about 8 miles distant; where it always finds a ready
market, and in general sells about 5 d per stone.  Conside-
rable quantities of butter and cheese, used also to be carried
to the market at Glasgow; but there is now a great demand
for these articles at home.

   Rent of the Parish.-The valued rent of the parish is
L. 1684: 11: 8 Scots: the real rent may be about L. 1400;
but as the land is, for the most part, possessed by the proprie-
tors, this cannot be exactly ascertained.

   Manufactures, and Price of Labour.-There are no manu-
factures established in the parish, except the cotton branch al-
ready mentioned.  The only tradesmen in the place, are such
as find employment from the country people; except a few
weavers, who are employed by manufacturers in Glasgow.-
The iron mines in the neighbourhood, together with the ope-
rations of the cotton manufacturers, have contributed greatly
to raise the wages of labourers.  Before the iron age, (as it may
be here called,) overtook us, a man's wages by the day,
was never above 1 s; but now they are advanced to 15 d and
