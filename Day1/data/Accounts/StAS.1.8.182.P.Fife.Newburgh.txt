     Statistical Account

years, several shops have been opened, upon a more extensive
scale; and there is reason to believe, that the demands of the
town and neighbourhood, will furnish the keepers of them
with employment.  Still, however, no trader has as yet ap-
peared in Newburgh, whose extensive transactions in com-
merce, would entitle him to the name and character of a mer-
chant; though perhaps the time is not far distant, when many
will be found here of that respectable desciption.

   Shore.-A few yards northward from the town, and nearly
connected with it by buildings, although beyond the limits of
its jurisdiction, lies the shore of Newburgh; which consists

A trade in wood and iron, is likewise carried on at the shore,
by a dealer, who resides upon the spot, and who has obtained
a pretty extensive sale.  A tannage is likewise forming there,
which will revive a trade, that was carried on at Newburgh,
in the end of the last century.  Formerly, great quantities of
burnt lime-stone, brought by land carriage, from the inland
