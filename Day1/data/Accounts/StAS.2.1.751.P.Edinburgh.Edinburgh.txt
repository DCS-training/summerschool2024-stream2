regular posts were sent to all parts of the country. As trade
and commerce increased, the revenues of the post office, which
for a long while were, in Scotland, very inconsiderable, began ra-
pidly to augment.
   In 1707 the annual revenue of the Edinburgh office was
L. 1194; in 1776 it had increased to L. 31,103; in 1783 it ex-
ceeded L. 40,000; while in 1839 it amounted to upwards of
L. 150,000.
   In 1776 a singular individual, Peter Williamson, then a keeper
of a coffee-room in the hall of the Parliament House, but who
had lived among the American Indians, first established on his
own account, a penny post in the city. For some years, this indi-
vidual employed four postmen, who went through the streets
ringing a bell, and collecting and distributing letters among the
community. At last, by a mutual arrangement, the business,
which turned out a profitable one, was handed over to the post
office establishment.
   Previous to the new regulations of 1840, the rate of postage
between Edinburgh and London for a single letter was 1s. 1 1/2 d.,
and twice this sum for a double letter, while 10d., 8d., 6d., and
4d. were charged for intermediate distances.
   The number of letters and the amount of revenue have continued
progressively to increase since the institution of the penny postage,
and the accommodation and facility both of transmitting letters,
parcels, and money have been most beneficially felt by the public.
   The number of officers and clerks employed in the Edinburgh
post office is 74, and of letter-carriers, 81; total, 159.

   Banks.-The oldest established public banking house in Edin-
burgh was the Bank of Scotland; which was erected by act of
Parliament in 1695. By the statute this company was empower-
ed to raise a joint stock of L. 1,200,000 Scots, or L. 100,000 Ster-
ling. The smallest share which could be held was L. 1000, and
the largest sum L. 20,000 Scots. The management of the affairs
of this Company was vested in a governor, deputy-governor, and
twenty-four directors. Every L. 1000 share commanded a vote in
the election of office-bearers. The holder of three shares was eligible
as a director, of six, as deputy-governor, and eight as governor
