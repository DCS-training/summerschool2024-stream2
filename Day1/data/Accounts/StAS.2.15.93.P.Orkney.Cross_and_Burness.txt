and inexcusable ignorance of south country capitalists, as to every-
thing connected with this remote but highly interesting and valu-
able county, no sales could be effected, and these properties have
been left not in the best possible situation for the comfort of the
people, nor for their own improvement, viz. under trust for the
payment of creditors.  With every disadvantage, however, the
peasantry of the country have done wonders for themselves.
   Most fortunately, before the entire fall of kelp, Mr Laing of Pap-
dale and others, had, by liberal encouragement and large advan-
ces, induced their small tenants and cottars to fit out boats, nets, and
lines, and to attempt the prosecuting of the herring and cod fisheries.
Taking warning from the bad effects of compulsory labour on the
kelp manufacture, these gentlemen did not enthral their tenants,
by any interference with the produce of their fisheries, but Ieft
them at liberty to dispose of their fish to the highest bidder, and
to lay out their gains as they thought fit.  The inhabitants of the
parishes of Cross and Burness, as, indeed, of the whole Island of
Sanday, were rather behind their neighbours in starting to this
new scene of industry; but they can now boast of many crews of
excellent fishermen and of well-rigged and powerful boats, to whose
numbers every year is adding; while the rising spirit of independ-
ence, which successful exertion and unfettered industry is sure to
produce in any people, leads them yearly to pay more and more at-
tention to improving the management of their small farms, of their
stock of cattle and horses, and to raising the scale of their per-
sonal comforts in clothing and lodging; so that, considering the
enormous quantity of land in those parishes, lying comparatively
waste and unproductive, the proprietors, with a little well-timed
direction and encouragement, may not only secure their present,
land rents, but look forward to making up, from the same source,
great part, if not all, of their heavy loss by kelp.
