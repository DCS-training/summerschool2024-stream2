17s. 6d., and the remaining L. 88 9s. 2d. is paid by the Ex-
chequer. The manse was built about thirty-six years ago.
	The number of communicants is about 200. The people at-
tend sermon as well as can be expected from the bad roads, and
the distance at which several of them are placed. There is no
chapel or meeting-house in this parish.
	There are four families of Dissenters, and three families of
Roman Catholics in the parish. All the rest belong to the Esta-
blisbed Church.
	Education.--A sufficient school-house and schoolmaster's house
were erected in this parish lately; but more than one-half of
the farmers' children receive no benefit from the parochial school
(the only school in the parish) on account of their distance, and
they are generally taught by young lads, who are hired to live in
their families through the winter season. There is a Sabbath
school taught in this village by the parochial schoolmaster, except
during four months in the depth of winter. The education of the
young is generally attended to; and there are no grown-up per-
sons in this parish who cannot read.
	The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 25, 13s. 4d. a year.
His fees may amount to L. 5 per annum. He has also the interest
of a mortified sum of L. 50 for the education of poor children,
and L. 2 for acting as precentor, session-clerk, &c.
	Poor.--There are no assessments in this parish. The poor are
supported by collections in the church, which amount to about
L. 15 a-year: and the interest of L. 300 left as a donation by
the late Earl of Stair, principal heritor of the parish. The ave-
rage number of persons receiving parochial aid is 16.
	Fuel.--The fuel used is moss or turf, and easily procured.
	Inns.--There are three inns in the village.
