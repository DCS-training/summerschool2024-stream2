these 16 heritors of borough land*.-The stipend is nearly 
10 chalders of victual, and nearly a third of the victual is
bear, and L. 11, 13 s. in money, and about 9 acres of a glebe.

repaired soon after the annexation took place, and new
losts put in for the additional number in the parish.
There was bequeathed by one James Davidson, a native
of Kintore, a sun for an annual sermon at this church; but
by his sister lifereting the money, the appointment has 
not yet taken place.  The schoolmaster has L. 7 salary,
and, at an average, 30 scholars in winter, and 20 in sum-
mer.  The session-clerk fee, with the perquisites, may be a-

   There are about 20 persons on the poors roll, who are
supported by the weekly collections, (amounting, at an
average, to about L. 14 annually), the pall dues, penalties,
rent of pews in the church, and the interest of near L. 200
mortified money.

   Highways and Bridges.-Two highways from Aberdeen
pass through the parish; they separate at the entry to this
parish, from Kinellar, near the 9th mile-stone.  One of them
runs straight west through this parish, and past the 12th
mile-stone into Kemnay, and proceeds up Don side.  The 
other turns N. W. through Kintore, Invenrury, etc. to In-
verness.  The 14th mile-stone is near the bridge of Inverury.
