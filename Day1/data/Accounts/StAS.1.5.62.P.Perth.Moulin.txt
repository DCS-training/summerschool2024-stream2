day, the size of the yarn being ordinarily a spindle or 48
cuts from a pound of lint.  The price of a stone of lint
from the mill, is, at an average, 13 s. 4 d.; and this, when
dressed or heckled, yields about 11 pounds of lint; the re-
fuse, consisting of tow, backings, etc.  being equal in value
to the price of dressing.  From these 11 pounds of lint, 11
spindles of yarn are spun, which are fold at the average
price of 2 s. 4 d. the spindle, or L. 1:5:8; the profit on the
whole is, therefore, 12 s. 4 d. or 1 s. 1 1/2 d. the spindle, which
generally takes three days to spin; therefore, the daily
earning of a spinner is 4 1/2 d.  In summer the women spin
woollen yarn.  Woollen cloths, for common wear, such as
hooding for mens coats and waistcoats, tartan for hose,
breeches, kilts and plaids, camelot for women's gowns,
plaiding for under petticoats and women's hose, are entirely
manufactured in the country.  The art of spinning with
both hands has of late been introduced, and is coming
fast into practice.
   A fair, held at Moulin the end of February, has always
been the principal market for the sale of linen yarn.
Hither the weavers and yarn-dealers from different parts
of Scotland used to refort, and buy up, for ready money, the
yarn which had been spun in the preceding 4 months.  But
for some years past, the yarn has been bought up, in the
course of the winter, by shopkeepers and yarn-dealers in
the country, who send it off to their employers in manu-
facturing towns, so that the quantity sold at the fair is now
inconsiderable.  The yarn has sold this winter and spring
1791 at 2 s. 6 d. and 2 s. 7 d. the spindle, which is reckoned
a good price*.  The consequence of yarn selling high is an

*In the present spring 1791, oat-meal sells at 1 s. the peck, and linen
yarn at 2 s. 6 d. the spindle.  To what straits must the people have been
reduced in 1741, when oat-meal sold at 1 s. 4 d. the peck, and yarn at 1 s.
the spindle.
