manufacture should fail, must bring certain ruin upon them,
their tenants, and their families.
   Kirkwall is composed of several sorts of people, namely
the gentlemen of property, who with their families generally
reside here;-shopkeepers, who have multiplied almost ten-
fold of late;-tradesmen, sailors, boatmen, and domestic
servants.

   Education.-Here we have an excellent school, under the
direction of two regularly bred, and well qualified masters,
who with much fidelity teach the learned languages, writing,
arithmetic, book-keeping, and the various branches of ma-
thematics.  This one is for boys, and another is just now
to be established for girls, who are to be instructed by a wo-
man sufficiently accomplished, for the purpose, in reading
English well, and writing it gramatically, all kinds of needle-
work, the French language, and music.  To diffuse the bless-
ings of education among the poor as well as the rich, a cha-
rity-school has lately been erected, and in it are taught read-
ing, writing, accounts, and the principles of the Christian re-
ligion.

   Soil and Culture.-The soil through this parish is very va-
rious.  In some parts, especially towards the hills or high,
grounds, we meet with a mixture of cold clay and moss;
near the shore it is generally of a sandy nature; rich black
loam is also to be met with in some few places, especially
near Kirkwall; and not only there, but in almost every other
parish in the country, the soil is shallow, with a bottom of
rock that is soft and mouldering.  In must places it is very
fertile, considering the way in which they manage it.  The
plough which the ordinary class of people use, is of a singular
construction, having only one stilt, and strange kind of irons.
