seen, and a general verdure appears on the face of the
ground.  Though the hills on the west attract the clouds,
and cause them to discharge a considerable quantity of rain,
yet as the general surface declines towards the sea and the
river, and as the soil is such that it readily absorbs the
water, the air is for the most part as dry, pure, and salu-
brious, as any where in the neighbourhood.  No epidemi-
cal diseases are known to prevail here, the measles and
small-pox excepted; to prevent the baleful effects of the
latter. inoculation is now generally used.

   Rivers.-The river Fleet runs on the borders of this
parish about 7 miles; one branch of which issues from a
small loch of the same name, in the parish of Girthon;
the other branch has its source in the parish of Kirkma-
breck, near the base of a very high hill, called Cairnsmuir.
It is navigable for small vessels of about 50 tons as far as the
village of Gatehouse, which is situated about 3 miles from
the mouth of the river.  Fish are not plenty in this river;
a few salmon, sea trout, yellow trout, and slounders, are
caught in it.  The salmon and sea trout are taken with
draught nets, but the quantity is so small, that it will scarce
defray the expense of labour, and is not a tenth part of
what it was 50 years ago.  They are caught from May to
the middle of August, and sold in Gatehouse and the neigh-
bourhood at about 3 d. the pound.

   Hills.-The most remarkable hill in this parish is Cairn-
harrah, which is situated partly in this parish, and partly in
Kirkmabreck.  It is elevated above the sea about 1100
feet.  The soil on it is of a mossy kind, covered with
heath, intermixed with grass, and not much incumbered
with rocks.  It is the highest ground in this part of the
country, Cairnsmuir excepted, commanding an extensive
