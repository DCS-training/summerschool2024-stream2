pense of seeking redress at a distance. This is the cause of much
complaint. *
  Inns, &c.-There are 12 inns or public-houses in the parish; of
these, there are 7 in the village, certainly by far too many for any
good or salutary purpose. Their influence on the morals and cir-
cumstances of the people is exceedingly injurious. There is but
one opinion among all well-thinking people in the community here,
as to the necessity of something being done towards the reduction
of the number of licenses.
  Fuel, &c.-In consequence of the distance and expense of coal,
its use is limited among the lower orders here. Their chief fuel
is peat, which is to be had in abundance in the moors in the neigh-
bourhood. The nearert good coal is to be had at Garseube,
thirteen miles from Drymen. The price of a cart of 14 cwt., in-
cluding carriage and tolls, is from 13s. to 14s.
