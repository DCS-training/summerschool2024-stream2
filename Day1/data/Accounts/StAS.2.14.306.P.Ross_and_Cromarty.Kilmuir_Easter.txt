Earl of Ross during the prevalence of the feudal systern. Within
the last two years, an elegant and handsome addition has been
made to it. There is a spacious lawn in front of the castle, taste-
fully laid out, and adorned with a variety of trees. Altogether, it
is one of the most delightful residences in the north of Scotland,
enjoying a commanding prospect of the finest scenery in the sur-
rounding country. Within a short distance of BaInagown, and
near the shore, stands Tarbat House, a highly finished modern
building, and the chief seat of Mr H. Mackenzie of Cromarty.
The grounds surrounding it are laid out with great taste, and have
of late years been highly improved. Kindace House is a com-
modious mansion, and very pleasantly situated in the upper part of
the parish. The house of Milmount is a beautiful residence.

	It will be observed, that the population of this parish has de-
creased since 1795, that is, in thirty-six years, by 419. This is
partly owing to emigration, but principally to the system of large
farm-letting, Which has of late years become so general. The
number of the population residing in villages may be estimated at
456; the remaining 1100 reside in the country.

There are three proprietors who generally reside in the parish;
Mr Hay Mackenzie of Cromarty, Sir Charles Ross of Balnagown,
and Captain Robertson of Kindace. All the land-owners, of whom
there are six, possess a yearly rental much greater,than L. 50
Sterling. The language generally spoken by the people is English,
though there are not a few of the aged who are unable to speak it.
The Gaelic language has very perceptibly lost ground within the
last forty years, owing to the desire which is now very prevalent
among parents of the lower classes to have their children taughtc
to read and understand English; and it would be difficult to meet
with many of the labouring people who, cannot speak English with
tolerable facility. The English.language Ls daily taught in the
Society School in the upper district of the parish, and this affords
