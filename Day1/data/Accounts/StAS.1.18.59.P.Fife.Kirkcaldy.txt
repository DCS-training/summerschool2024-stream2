   Sir George M'Kenzie calls him one of the greatest Philo-
sophers, Mathematicians, Physicians, and Linguists, of the
times in which he lived; and says, that had he not been so
much addicted to astrology, alchymy, physiognomy, and chi-
romancy, he would have deserved well of the republic of let-
ters.
   Towards the middle of the 17th century, Messrs George
and Patrick Gillespie, natives of this place, and Mr. Robert
Douglas, who, with Patrick Gillespie, was some time minister
of Kirkaldy, distinguished themselves by their writings and their
conduct, in the ecclesiastical history of those difficult times.
All the three were zealously attached to the cause of Presby-
tery, which was then considered in Scotland as intimately
connected with the cause of general liberty.  Two of them,
Mr George Gillespie, and Mr Douglas, having been pre-
viously translated to Edinburgh, were in 1643 nominated by
the General Assembly of the church of Scotland, Commission-
ers to the Assembly of Divines at Westminster; in the pro-
ceedings of which, Mr Gillespie in particular conducted
himself with much ability and prudence.  He was one of the
first characters at that time in the church.  He wrote Mis-
cellanies, etc.  He died in 1649, at the age of 36.  A mar-
ble monument, which was inscribed to his memory, (it is be-
lieved at the public expence), and which, as an appended in-
scription bears, was pulled down through the "malign in-
"fluence of Archbishop Sharp," but afterwards repaired by the
relations of Mr Gillespie, is still standing in this church yard.
   After the death of Charles I.  Mr Douglas and Mr Patrick
Gillespie took different sides.  The former espoused the in-
terests of Charles II. at whose coronation at Scone in 1651
