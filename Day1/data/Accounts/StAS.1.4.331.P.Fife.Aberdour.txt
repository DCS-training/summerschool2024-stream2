     of Aberdour.

Mickry and Carcary, vary the appearance of the frith.
The coast of Lothian is just distant enough to be seen with
advantage.  The city of Edinburgh and its environs rise
in view, and the distant Pentland Hills terminate the
prospect.

   Village and Manufactures.-The village of Aberdour
lies about a quarter of a mile from the sea.  It is quite
surrounded by rising grounds, except towards the south.
Between the village and the sea are rich corn-fields, and
the sharpness of the sea-air is kept off by a great number
of fine old spreading trees.  The venerable old castle of
Aberdour, rising amidst trees, stands on the eastern bank
of the rivulet, which, taking a winding course below it,
falls into the frith in front.  The situation is beautiful, and
the prospects from it magnificent.  To the north of this
ruin stands the house of Hillside, commanding different
views of the Forth, and exhibiting the richest and most
diversified scenes.  Between this and the village, the ri-
vulet runs in the bottom of a little rich strath, and its bor-
ders in summer are covered with cloth and yarn, which
gives a pleasing idea of the industry of the people.  There
are 36 weavers in the village, who are employed principally
in making coarse cloths and tickings.  The only manu-
facture for export is the coarse tickings, of which there are
made about 520 webs annually, of 70 or 80 yards each.
There is a small manufacture of spades, shovels, etc. lately
erected in the parish.  The great hammer is driven by
water.  There are about 15 tons of kelp made annually
upon the coast and the island of Inchcolm.
