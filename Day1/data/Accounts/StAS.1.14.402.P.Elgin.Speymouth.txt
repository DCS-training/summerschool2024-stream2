farmers, and the poorer sort of the people, use cloth
made at home.  In this parish, most of the common te-

their families with shirts, etc, which they spin also in
their houses.  The industry of the women in spinning

yarn for sale.  The bonnet is still commonly used by
the men.  A watch is no uncommon thing among the
servants.

lime.  In other parts, clumps or pieces of plantation, pro-
perly disposed, would be a great improvement.  Exten-
sive plantations have been made on the W. side of this
parish, by the Duke of Gordon and the Earl of Fife,
which are already a great ornament, and will soon be
of great use to the country.  There is no doubt that
the plantations will soon be continued on each side of
the highway all along to Spey.  As our mosses are near-

tations for a supply of fuel.  Firs, and some other kinds
of wood, grow on our hardest soil to the sea side.-The
