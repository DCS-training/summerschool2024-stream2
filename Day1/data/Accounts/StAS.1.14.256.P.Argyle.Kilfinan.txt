     Statistical Account

coals are carried by water from Glasgow or Irvine; and
notwithstanding the freight being very high, they are
reckoned, upon the whole, especially now that the duty
is taken off them, cheaper than peats; and it would
undoubtedly be the interest of the tenants, who have
mostly boats of their own, to carry coals from Glasgow,
rather than lose their time, and spoil their horses work-
ing at peats.  The freight from Glasgow is generally
between 2 s. and 2 s. 6 d. the single cart; but those who
take a great cargo, and employ gaberts, get them a little
cheaper.

   Antiquities.-There is nothing remarkable of this
kind to be seen in this parish, excepting cairns, duns,
and borradhs.  These cairns, of which there are but
few in parish, are large piles of stones heaped to-
gether, where battles are supposed to have been fought,
and where heroes fell, and are buried.  In many parts
of the Highlands, where they are to be seen, tradition
is very distinct concerning them, and generally the name
of the person or persons put to death sticks to the cairn.
   Duns are very numerous, not only in this, but in all
parishes in the Highlands.  They a row of large
stones put together, generally in a circular form, on the
top of conspicous hills, not far from, and always in
fight of one another.  In this parish, where as many of
them are to be seen, in proportion to the extent of the
place, as any where we know; they are generally on
hills of a conical figure.  They are supposed to have
been places for kindling fires on, for the purpose of
warning the country, and summoning the people to as-
semble for the common defence, on the sudden appear-
ance of an enemy.
