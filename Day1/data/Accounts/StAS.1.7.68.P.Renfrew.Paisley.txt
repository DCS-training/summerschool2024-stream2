   Poor.-A manufacturing town must always have a great
proportion of poor belonging to it.  When trade is brisk,
great numbers of tradesfolk, and working people of all de-

many parts of Scotland, is discontinued, recourse is had to a
scheme of supporting them by a discretionary tax upon the

as there is too much reason to fear that it will be productive
