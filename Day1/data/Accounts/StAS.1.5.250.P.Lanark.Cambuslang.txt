cept what is preserved for feed, and, at least, a third of the
potatoes, are sold in Glasgow.

   Implements of Husbandry.-In this parish there are about
70 ploughs, mostly of the old Scotch fashion, but not so
heavy and clumsy as formerly.  Every considerable farm-
er has at least two ploughs, a larger and a less.  The lar-
ger is drawn by 3 horses, and always employed where one
plowing only is necessary, and also for the first plow-
ings, where more are necessary.  The less is drawn by 2
horses, and employed in all subsequent plowings after the
first or second.  Many of the farmers are of opinion, that
Small's chain plough, drawn by 2 horses, does not turn
their wet stiff clayey soil effectually.  It is used, however,
by some farmers, in light dry land, and, by others, in gi-
ving the last plowings to summer fallow, and both find it
to answer abundantly well.  There are two corn mills, one
on the Calder, and another on the Clyde; the latter is ca-
pable of grinding 30 or 40 bolls a-day, and it is almost
constantly employed, in winter and spring, by the farmers
in the neighbourhood, and in summer and autumn by the
dealers in foreign grain, in and about Glasgow.  In some
seasons 2000 bolls of foreign oats have been milled here,
and in every season above 1000.  Here thirlage still conti-

   Effects of connection with Glasgow.-This and the neigh-
bouring parishes depend, in a great measure, on Glas-
gow; which is the market where they sell every thing they
can spare, and buy every thing they want.  The state of
manufactures and commerce in that city extends its influ-
ence over all the adjacent country.  Glasgow is happily
situated for carrying on trade with America; and ever
