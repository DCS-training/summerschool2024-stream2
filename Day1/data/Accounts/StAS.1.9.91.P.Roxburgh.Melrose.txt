chitecture, a quarter of it yet standing, but the spire
gone.  The roof of the south side of the cross is still
standing, where is a beautiful stair-cafe, much admired by
strangers, the roof of it winding like a snail cap.  There
was within the church a vast number of fonts curiously.
carved, and where were altars dedicated to various saints.
In the portion of the church where worship is at present
performed, are two rows of pillars of excellent workman-
ship, especially that to the south-east, which for the fine-
ness of it, looks like Flander's lace.
   With regard lastly, to what was in part, or altogether,
separated from the body of the church, there was a cloyster
on the north side, a part of the walls of which is still re-
maining; and where may be observed pleasant walks and
seats, with a great deal of fine flowers nicely cut as lilies,
etc. also ferns, grapes, house-leeks, escalops, fir-cones, etc.
The door at the north entry of the church is curiously em-
bossed, and the foliage here, and in several places of the
church, very beautiful.  There were also here a vast many
fine buildings within the convent, for the residence and ser-
vice of the abbot and monks, with gardens and other con-
veniencies; all this inclosed within an high wall, about a
mile in circuit.  Besides the high church, there has been a
large fine chapel, where the manse now is, and another house
adjoining to it, where the foundations of the pillars are still
to be seen.  On the north side of this house, there has been
a curious oratory or private chapel, the foundations of
which have been discovered this year, and a large cistern
of one stone, with a leaden pipe conveying the water to
it.

three Eildon hills.  The base of them may be in compass
