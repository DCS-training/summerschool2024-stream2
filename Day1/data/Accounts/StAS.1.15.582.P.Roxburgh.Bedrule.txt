dered it otherwise, this is in a great measure to them imprac-
ticable, not only by their distance from one another, but more
especially their generally low circumstances, who, notwith-
standing, as our happy Constitution has fixed it, have as good
a right, by law, to enjoy the advantages of religious instruc-
tion and education, by the wise institution of parochial cler-
gy, and established schoolmasters, as their more wealthy
brethren in cities and in towns, to whom, by their nearness
to one another, their numbers and greater wealth, the want
of these establishments, so particularly necessary in the coun-

thereof, be more easily supplied; whereas, if the poor and
scattered inhabitants in most landward parishes, be deprived

and whenever the institution of public instructors has a different tendency,
which, we are apt to believe, is seldom the case, this by no means proceeds
from the nature or principle of the institution itself, but from the perversion
of its original intention and obvious use, and this the community ought, there-
fore, ever most carefully to guard against, and also against any of its members
being constrained to attend the Established teachers, in preference to others,
or those who do attend them, being any way disturbed on that account.
