   Antiquities.-Several ruins of Popish chapels or churches
are to be seen in the parish; round most of them are burying-
grounds, which are to this day used for that purpose.  A few
of them, can, only be traced by the foundation-stones; the
walls of others are pretty entire.  The largest and most

form, with passages and small apartments, in the walls; the
only entry was from the top.  Tradition says, that there
