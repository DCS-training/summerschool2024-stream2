lation was less than half what it is now, and money four times the
value.
	Inns.--There has been an increase in the number of inns, or
rather whisky shops, in the parish, at the rate of six to one, within
the last forty years; which either tends to, or is a proof of, the de-
moralization of the inhabitants; at present their number is as
one to less than every 250 souls in Lesmahago.

			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATION,
	This parish has undergone a great change since the last Sta-
tistical Account was published; the population has greatly in-
creased; the lands have been generally inclosed; plantations have
sprung up; roads, from mere tracts, have become good carriage
ways; and these, with thd opening up of lime in several places,
have given a facility to improvements in agriculture which has not
been neglected; an improved mode of husbandry has been adopted;
draining has been introduced; and waste lands to a great extent
have been brought into cultivation. These improvements, how-
ever, may, with due encouragement on the part of the landlords,
be carried still farther, and, by giving employment to labourers,
would add to the comfort and happiness of that useful class of so-
ciety, and tend to the diminution of pauperism,--Objects which
ought never to be lost sight of by judicious landlords.
