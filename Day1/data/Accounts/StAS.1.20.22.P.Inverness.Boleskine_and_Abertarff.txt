     Statistical Account

eight miles from Lochlochy; but Gow having and arrow in
his side all the time, found himself unable to proceed far-
ther, and there pulled out the arrow and expired.  His de-
scendants in commemoration of this amazing effort of at-
tachment, enjoyed a croft of land, rent free, from the family
of Foyers till within these sixty years.  Mr Fraser of Foyers
having recovered from his wounds, was enabled, with the
assistance of the few commoners who had not accompanied
their chief on this fatal occasion, to protect the country from
the inroads of the rival clan, who were much enfeebled by 
the effects of this severe conflict.
   The numerous offspring descended of the Frasers killed
in that battle, grew up, in process of time, to obliterate teh
depopulation thereby occasioned; and to corroborate the
evidence resulting from the above passage in Buchanan,
it is a notorious fact, that the whole principal gentlemen
now resident in Stratherrick do, (with a few exceptions),
trace their descent either from Mr Fraser of Foyers, or Far-
raline above mentioned; hence the country of Stratherrick
for many years consisted principally of two tribes, teh one
called Mac-mhic-ulliams, or Foyer's tribe; and the other
Sliochd-ion-mhic-alister, or Farraline's tribe: and from the
state of the Highlands requiring much the attachment of 
vassals and tenants to their chief, Stratherrick was more
considered as a nursery of men, than as yielding much pe-
cuniary emolument to the Lovat family.  Some of them 
received feu-rights of certain parts of the country, and all
the younger fons, possessed of any funds, obtained proper
wadsets of their respective possessions; and in the general
valuation of the county for ascertaining the land-tax, in the
1691, every wadsetter is rated in the same manner with the
heritors.
