	The town is governed by twenty-one councillors, who select
from among themselves a Provost, and three Bailies, and other
office-bearers, by whom the police of the burgh is administered at
the expensd of the conmmon gude or burgh revenue, there being no
assessment for any purpose imposed by the magistrates or coun-
cil. The parliamentary and municipal constituency, as adjusted
by the sheriff of Dumfries-shire on the 17th of August 1837, was
179, and the constituency of the landward part of the parish at
70 or 80. From time immemorial, the heritors of Annan, both
burghal and landward, and their tenants, had possessed the right
of pasturage and cutting turf on 1650 acres (Scotch measure) of
indifferent commonty lying to the north of the town. As this land
was, under such management, very unproductive, it was in the
year 1802 divided among those interested ; burdened, however,
with an annual payment of L. 200 to the magistrates for behoof of
the conimunity,--which sum was, at the suggestion of Mrs Gra-
ham, the amiable and accomplished wife of the author of the Sab-
bath, appropriated to secure L. 1000 to be expended in building,
and L. 65 annually in endowing, an academy for the public bene-
fit. The annual income of the institution is now L. 113, exclu-
sive of wages. The average number of scholars for the last ten
years has been 141. This is an excellent institution, and has
proved highly beneficial to the burgh, the parish, and the sur-
rounding district. An Infant School has also been lately esta-
blished in the burgh. The school-house was built in 1834 by sub-
scription. The teacher, Miss Williamson, receives a salary of
L. 30 per annum, which sum is paid partly from small weekly
charges on the children, and partly by subscription. The number
of pupils in regular attendance, from three to six years of age, is
averaged at 85. Its beneficial effects are now fully acknowledg-
ed and duly appreciated by the public.
	In the former management of the burgh concerns, it appears
