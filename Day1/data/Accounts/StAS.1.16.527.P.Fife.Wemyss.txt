tween 8 and 9 acres, and is all inclosed*.  There are some
rocks and sea-weed, which belong to the minister, and as
this property is near the glebe, it is of great advantage for
manure.  For the kelp from the rocks the present incum-
bent has received about L. 5, 5 s. every three years.
   There was once a parsonage and vicarage at Methil, the
patronage of which was disponed by Archbishop Hamilton
to Sir John Wemyss of Wemyss, who died in 1571+.

The following Persons have been Ministers of this Parish

   tober 1697, and translated to Perth July 1698.
Rev. Mr James Grierson, ordained September 1698, and

<FOOTNOTE>

*A considerable quantity of flax is raised in this parish; and the
glebe, from the following remark, will appear to be no unfavourable soil
for it.  The Rev. Dr Spens sowed one year 9 lippies of lintseed, which
yielded from the mill 18 stones.  In 1787, the present incumbent sowed
3 lippies, which he winnowed from his preceding crop, and it yielded
from the mill 7 1/2 stones.  The same year he rowed 2 lippies of foreign
feed, which only yielded a stones 10 lb.  It may be of rome advantage to
observe, that the lint 1787 was pulled before it was fully ripened, and
great care was taken in the watering of it.  Much lint is lost from being
too long in the water.

   +This Sir John Wemyss, says Bishop Leslie, "upon the head of the
"Gentlemen of Fife in 1547, gave the English, who landed in the coun-
"ty, a considerable defeat, and killed about 700 of them."
