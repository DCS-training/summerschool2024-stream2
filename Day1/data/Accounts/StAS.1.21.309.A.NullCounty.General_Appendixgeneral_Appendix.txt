     The Statistical Account.

the sum inevitably dwindles away.  From such an allowance,
the schoolmaster is to furnish, for himself, and his family, if
any family has the misfortune to be connected with him, all
the requisites of a decent subsistence, suitable to his station
in society.  It ought to be observed, indeed, that he is ge-
nerally accommodated with the bare walls of a small hovel,
which forms part of the public school-house.  But or this
convenience he can seldom avail himself: for, beside acci-
dental circumstances, its size, for the most part, is so small,
as not to afford accommodation for more than a single per-
son; and its state of repair such, as to render it fitter for the
climate of Italy, than to repel the piercing blasts of the north,
or the 'pelting of the pitiless storm.'
   How inadequate such a provision must be for the purpose,
let those gentlemen judge, for judge they surely can, who
must now purchase the labour of servants in husbandry at
nearly the same annual cost; whether they hire them by the
year, or by the day, and whether they maintain them as
part of their family, or allow them a stipulated sum as the
price of their service.  How adequate it is, let those la-
bourers also declare, and they honestly will, who are thus
obliged to model their desires and their wants on the narrow
basis of such an income.  In the third volume of your Statis-
tical Account, which often so successfully elucidates the pre-
sent situation of the country, we have a table of the expen-
ces of a common labourer, with a wife and four children;
which, though perhaps not quite accurate in some particu-
lars, gives a just idea of their manner of subsistence, on the
whole.  The amount, it may be observed, rises rather above
the emolument of schools; although, from the details, which.
I subjoin, it seems difficult to imagine on what article the
expence could well be abridged.
