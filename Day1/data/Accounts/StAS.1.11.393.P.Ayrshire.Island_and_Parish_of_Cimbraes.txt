     of Cimbreas.

   Soil, Cultivation, Produce, and Minerals.-The soil, in ge-
neral, is a gravelly loam, and some clay.  It produces good
crops of oats, bear, pease, potatoes, and some flax.  The
manure, besides what is made on the farms, is sea weed, and
shells, with small coral, which they dig out of pits in several
parts of the island.  It has been observed, that were the
farms more generally inclosed, and subdivided and improved,
by the introduction of turnips and sown grass, it would add
much to the fertility of the island.  The advantage of there
improvements, and the addition of the manure, upon their
farms, that such crops would produce, could not fail, with
the industry of the farmers of this island, to be highly bene-
ficial, and would put the ground in a progressive state of me-
lioration.  Were a plan of this kind properly formed, there
can be little doubt but suitable encouragement would be given
by the proprietors; by assisting them in inclosing their farms,
and by lengthening their leases, which are too short, and their
renewal too precarious, for great exertions; a circumstance
which equally affects the interest of the proprietor and tenant.
There is plenty of lime-stone in the island; but the great
expence of coal has hitherto prevented its being used as a
manure.  There is also an unexhaustible fund of free-stone.

   Trees.-There are few trees on the island; but the few we
have, seem to grow tolerably well.  Lord Glasgow has made
a small plantation of pines and Scotch firs, on a piece of
moorish rising ground; and, should they thrive, the hills
might be planted farther up; and, assisted by the shelter of
those below, in keeping them from the influence of the sea
water, such plantations might, in time, be very valu-
able, from the demand on the Clyde, and the advantage of
water carriage.
