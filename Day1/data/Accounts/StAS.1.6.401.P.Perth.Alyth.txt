thriving plantations are farther advanced, the farms properly
divided and inclosed, and a rotations of crops observed accor-
ding to the leases lately granted, the value of the property, and 
the appearance of this part of the country will be much increas-
ed and improved.-Beyond the hill of Bamff is the forest
of Alyth, a large tract of heath ground, consisting of more
than 6000 acres, which chiefly belonged to four proprietors
who possessed it in common; but is now divided among them.
The forest, which is skirted on the W. with arable ground,
affords pasture for a considerable number of sheep and black
castle.  The sheep are either of the Linton breed, or the small
white faced kind raised in this part of the country.  An excel-
lent breed of wedders, brought from Linton annually when a year
old, thrive well.  They are commonly sold when four years
old at 13 s. or 14 s. the head.  Their wool is coarse; indeed
none of the sheep here are remarkable for fine wool.-In the
forest are very extensive mosses, which supply the country around
with fuel.  It abounds in game, especially muirfowl, and is
much frequented in the shooting season.  At the extremity of
the parish there is a beautiful little country, surrounded with
hills, and intersected by the black water or Ericht, which in sum-
mer has a delightful appearance.  That part of it connected
with this parish is called the Blackunnans lies in the county of
Angus.

   Rent and Population.-The valued rent of the parish is
L. 8233: 17: 4 Scotch.  There are 5 or 6 heritors who have
considerable estates, besides several smaller proprietors, and a
number of feuars.  The family of Bamff, represented by Sir
William Ramfay, Bart. have charters of the estate they now
possess, since the reign of King Alexander II. A. D. 1232.
Three of the considerable heritors reside part of the year in
the parish, and most of the smaller ones.
