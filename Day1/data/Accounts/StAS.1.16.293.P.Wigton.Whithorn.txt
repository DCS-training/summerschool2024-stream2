of losing that provision.  I think I hear some self-conceited
person cry out, Why don't they send to a licenced cellar or
warehouse, and get salt in a legal way?  Why, I tell thee,
thou wiseacre, that in these places there is little other than
smuggled salt.  Wisdom calls for a review of the salt laws;
and justice and impartiality require at least their equaliza-
tion.
   Were the duty on salt taken off it, and laid upon Bri-
tish spirits, much good would arise from the commutation
to the public.  It would tend to soberise the people, and
to lead them to the use of malt liquor.  At present, there
is little malt liquor sold in this country.
   The duty on English salt is 5 s. per bushel, weighing
56 lb.; but I never heard of 1 s. of duty being received, it
being all smuggled.  Make the duty lower, and it will be
paid.

   Harbour at Isle of Whithorn, etc.-At Isle of Whithorn
there is a good natural harbour, improved by a quay.  It
is narrow at the entrance, but very safe for vessels when
in.  Eight or nine small sloops belong to this place, in
which about 30 mariners are employed.  They bring coal
and lime from England carry sea-shells from the river
Cree, and take away the grain, potatoes, with some fat
cattle, sheep, and swine to the different markets.  Here is
stationed one of his Majesty's revenue cutters.

   Farms.-The average rent of land is 12 s. 6 d. per acre.
Farms are from L. 30 to L. 300 per annum, and houses are
let at L. 14, and downwards.

   Schools-There are three schools, one of which is esta-
blished by law; the master enjoys a salary of L. 9.
