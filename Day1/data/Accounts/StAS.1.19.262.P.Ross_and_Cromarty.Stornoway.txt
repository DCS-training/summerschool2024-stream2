that grief for the loss of husband or wife is an affliction little
known among the lower class of people here.
   A woman, in this country, whose husband shot himself
accidentally, by an unguarded management of a firelock,
settled her contract of marriage, in the way she thought fit,
before the body of her late husband was interred, and was
married the next day after she performed that last duty to
the deceased.
