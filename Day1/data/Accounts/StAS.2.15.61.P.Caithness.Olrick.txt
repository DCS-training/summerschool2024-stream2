of the salmon-fishing, let to a respectable tenant), now only by the
labourers as a recreation from other work, and for the use of their
families.
   Allusion has been already made to the harbour at Castlehill;
and it is much to be regretted that no steps have been taken for
having a harbour also erected in the bay of Murkle, which is so
well adapted for the purpose, and which would afford shelter to
vessels in distress, or retarded in their progress by contrary winds,
being almost naturally locked in from the effects of that dangerous
neighbour, the Pentland Frith, and there being abundance of water
at all times of tide.
   Lakes.-The only lake, that of Durran, mentioned in the for-
mer Statistical Account, was drained many years ago, and has
amply rewarded the proprietors,-the surface of water being now
exchanged for inexhaustible pits of marl and rich meadow pas-
ture.
                    II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Parochial Registers.-The earliest date of these is 1700, since
which period the record of session, including births and marriages,
has been regularly kept; but no record of deaths seems to have
been kept in this parish at any period.
   Antiquities.-Torfaeus mentions a nunnery, the site of which is
obviously indicated by the burn of Closters (cloisters), running
through the farm of Redlands, on the estate of Murkle, and not
far from a green hillock resembling the Pictish cairns, which

   On the top of the hill of Olrick, on the southern boundary of the
parish, there are evident remains of a wacth-tower, which, in for-
mer times, must have been of no little importance, from the ex-
tensive view it commands of the coast and the country round.
From this spot the bays of Sanidside, Scrabster, Dunnet, Freswick,
and Reiss, Dunnet-head, the hills of Canisbay and- Noss-head, all
in this county, together with some of the islands of Orkney, and
also some of the mountainous parts of Sutherland, Moray, Banff,
and Aberdeen shires are visible,-affording one of the most exten-
sive and finest views to be found in this northern part of the country.
   On the boundary of the parish on the east, towards Dunnet,
it is said there existed a church, the position of which is as-
certained by the name of St Coomb's Kirk (perhaps in honour
of St Columba), being still given to the spot; and there is a
farther tradition, that this church and the adjoining manse, sup-
