not to be able to read intelligently books either of history or of
practical divinity; and consequently they cannot be expected to
follow and appreciate a connected discourse from the pulpit. The
defective state of education is deeply to be deplored. And I see
not hov it can be remedied till parents are more faithful, and pains-
taking in the discharge of the vows which they take upon them-
selves at the baptism of their children. The teachers of youth may
labour as they please, but if there is no training at home, their la-
bours will be comparatively fruitless. Were parents to be regular
and persevering in giving instructions to their children, on the after-
noon and evening of the Lord's day, it is incalculable not only what
progress would be made in scholarship, but, by the blessing of
God, what moral improvement would take place. The want of
piety and practical godliness lies at the root of all the evils that
abound amongst us. Could people be made pious, then, as a mat-
ter of course, they would become frugal and industrious, and, as a
general rule, they would improve in worldly comforts, in proportion
to the growth of grace in the soul. Were the money that is spent
in the alehouse devoted to its proper objects, the comfort of many
families would be greatly increased, and the children who are at
present neglected might receive a suitable education.
