   Rent of Land.-The valued rent of the parish is
L. 4026:3:10: Scotch; the real rent has been estimated at
nine times that sum, or somewhat more than L. 3000 Ster-
ling.  Single acres of good arable land, in the neighbourhood
of the villages of Moulin and Pitlochry, pay from 30 s. to
34 s. of yearly rent.  A field of good arable land may pay
a rent of 22 s. the acre.  Ordinary land is let at the rate
of 17 s. the acre.  The rent of infield pasture ground is the
same with that of arable.  A horse's grazing on hill ground,
is valued at 5 s. a month; a cow's at 2 s. 6 d.  A plough-
gang consisting, at an average, of 13 acres of arable land,
and hill ground sufficient for pasturing 4 horses and 10 cows,
pays L. 17 of yearly rent.- A third part of the landed pro-
perty has been sold within the last thirty years, but it is not
often changing.  The average price of those lands may
have been about 30 years purchase; but they now yield 
in general, a rent equal to 5 or 6 per cent on the purchase-
money.
