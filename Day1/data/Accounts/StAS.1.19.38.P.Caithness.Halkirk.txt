     Statistical Account

kinds of black oats are raised, and a considerable quantity
of white kinds.  Yet, though these yield more meal, they
are found not to be well calculated for this soil, nor so pro-
fitable.  However, by the bye, I know not but this may
be as much owing to mistaken notions, and a predilection
in favour of old usages, as to any other cause.
   Bear.-The bear, for the most part, is in some degree in-
ferior in quality to that of more southern counties: Yet,
in good years, and in the most fertile spots of the parish, it
weighs between 17 and 18 stones per boll.  In any year it
is reckoned preferable to any that grows almost in this
county.  The returns of it, in growth, are various, being
4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 at the utmost.  Yet, estimated at an ave-
rage, the whole crop, bear and oats, does not much exceed
4 returns.  But, I believe, that with more pains and in-
dustry, and proper encouragement and example to infuse
that spirit into the people, the crop might be considerably
meliorated; however, in good years, the produce is con-
siderably more than is necessary for the support of the
parish in its present state.  The whole amount in bear and
oat meal, at an average, according to the best of my enquiry
and calculation, is about 15,500 bolls, the boll of meal at
8 1/2 stones.

   Prices of Victual, and other Necessaries of Life.-The ave-
rage price of victual, I mean of bear and meal, for we have
no other, is, for some years past, 13 s. 4 d. per boll; of
good beef, 2 1/2 d. per lb.; of mutton and pork, when good,
the same; of geese, sold at Martinmas, 1 s. 4 d. per goose;
of hens, 6 d. each; of eggs, 2 d. per dozen; of sheep hogs
or wedders, 7 s. per hog; of swine, 12 s. each.  There are
some of them that sell considerably below, and some consi-
derably above that price, according to their quality and
size; of an ordinary cow or ox, for slaughter, and in flesh,
