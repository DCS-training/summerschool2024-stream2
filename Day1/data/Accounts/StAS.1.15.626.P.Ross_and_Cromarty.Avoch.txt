ral sloops also were dispatched with full cargoes of unpacked
herrings for Dunbar, and other towns on the east coast.-
Since that period, the success in general has been poor at
this station, little more than what served to supply the neigh-
bouring country; except in spring 1792, when about 1100
barrels were exported.  Last winter, the herrings were un-
commonly scarce.  And the present season, 1793-4, though
it promised well in autumn, has turned out but indifferently.
There are not now (in February) 200 barrels packed.
   The herrings found here are seldom so large as those caught
at Caithness, and Lochbroom, which makes it necessary for
the men to provide a different set of nets of a smaller mesh
and depth, than what they use at the former stations.  Nor
have any buildings as yet been erected at Avoch, for curing
them in the red manner.  The quantity of herrings sufficient
to pack a barrel when cured, is sold here fresh, at from 3 s.
to 5 s. 6 d. according to the quality and the demand.  And
the middle-sized, when fat, are reckoned much nicer, and
more delicate eating, than larger ones, though they do not
fetch, so good a price at the London and other markets, being
not accounted so fit for exportation to hot climates.  But,
if our best hands, at all the different stations in the north and
west of Scotlands were provided with large and commodious
busses, so that they could go out and continue fishing in deep
water, and cure their herrings on board, in the same expedi-
tious and careful manner that the Dutch do, this business
might soon become much more advantageous to Great Bri-
tain than at present, and our fish become as saleable abroad
as theirs!  And the weaker and more indifferent hands would,
at same time, find the better employment in continuing to
catch for ordinary consumption at home, from the smaller
