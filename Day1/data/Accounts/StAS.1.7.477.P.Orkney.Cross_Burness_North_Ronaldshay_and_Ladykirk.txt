lows-24 merks make 1 setting, equal nearly to 32 lib.
Dutch.-6 settings make 1 meel, equal nearly to 11 1/4 from
Dutch.  The bear pundlar is to the malt pundlar nearly as
2 to 3, and has the same names to the different portions of
its weight, that is-24 merks make 1 setting, nearly equal to
1 stone 5 lib.  Dutch.-6 settings make 1 meel, nearly equal
to 7 1/4 or 7 1/2 stone Dutch.  The bismar is a smaller weight;
and weighs from 1 to 24 merks, which last is denominated a
setting or lispund.  The malt pundlar is used in weighing oat-
meal or malt.  The bear pundlar is used in weighing bear or
bigg only.  The bismar is used for weighing butter, and o- 
ther things.  The accounts of the rents payable in oatmeal
and malt are kept in meels, settings, and merks, all of the
denomination of the malt pundlar, as above.-The accounts
of rents payable in bear or bigg are kept in chalders, meels,
settings, and merks, all of the denomination of the bear
pundlar, as above.-The accounts of rents payable in butter
are kept in barrels, lispunds, and merks, which two last are
usually paid by the bismar.  It is further necessary to ob-
serve, that a chalder of bear consists of 36 meels on the bear
pundlar; and, as the bear is of inferior quality, and usually
weighs only from 11 1/2 to 14 stone Dutch the Linlithgow boll,
therefore 1 4/6 or 1 5/6 of a meel of bear is usually equal to a boll
of measure, and consequently the chalder will contain 20 1/2 or
21 bolls of Linlithgow measure.  But, as this may not be un-
derstood even after the above explanation, it may be proper,
1st, To state the rents of these two islands in the manner in
which they are paid by these weights; and then to convert
them into Scotch measure by the Linlithgow boll.
