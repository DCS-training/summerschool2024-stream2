the advance of the price of produce, the gradual improve-
ment of the country, and the security of property.
   As almost every farm has a proportion of  grass and pa-
sture, it is difficult to say what may be the average rent of
arable land by itself; but some acres in the strath or low
part of Urquhart, set as high as 20 s. per acre, without any
benefit of pasturage.

   Surface and Soil.-The surface of the parish is extremely
unequal; in general it is a mountainous country, yet con-
sists of a most beautiful variety of hill and dale, rock  and
wood.  Both the Glens of Urquhart and Glenmoriston ex-
hibit to the traveller an uncommon and picturesque view of
what is beautiful, grand, and sublime in nature; at the same
time that some of the mountains present great tracts of
stone and moss, incapable of cultivation or improvement.
   Urquhart is divided into strath and braes, and is in gene-
ral a rich, though not a deep loam, and uncommonly fruit-
ful.  It produces abundant crops of white and black oats.
bear, and rye.  Wheat has also been tried with good success.
Green crops, such as potatoes, turnips, clover, and rye-grass,
pease, and lint, are also raised to good account where the
ground is properly prepared.
   The soil of Glenmoriston is very inferior to that of Ur-
crops of potatoes, black oats, a little white oats, and some
bear; sown grasses also succeed pretty well where the
ground is properly managed.

   Mountains.-The most remarkable mountain in the pa-
rish is Mealsuarmhonie, which rises on the west side of Loch-
ness, to the height of 3060 feet above the leverl of the sea.
It is noted for being the first land-mark with mariners.
