     Live-Stock.--Of cattle there are two breeds. In the first place,
  the pure Highland, which has been much improved of late years
  by the introduction of bulls and breeding cows, selected frond the
  best Highland stocks in Scotland.  Secondly, crosses from the
  short-horned bull and Highland cows have been introduced, and
  answer well, especially for feeding, as they are brought at an early
  age to a great size and weight; and, since the introduction of steam
  conveyance, can be conveniently sent to the southern or metropo-
  litan markets. The common breed of sheep is the Cheviot.  This
  is crossed by the Leicester tup, ; and the cross thrives remarkably
  well.  These sorts of stock are the most profitable, taken together
  with the present improved system of agriculture and rotation of
  crops.  Both sheep and cattle,indeed are in such a forward state
  of improvement, as to be capable of being brought into competition
