   State of Property.-This parish contains 120 old ploughs
of land.  In former times one tenant possessed a plough,
and had always under him several cottars, or subtenants,
who held of no other superior, and were bound to personal
service for part of the rents of their crofts.  There are still
subtenants on the larger farms.  The generality of tenants,
however, hold immediately of the heritor; and the prac-
tice of dividing the ploughs, which is very general here,
accommodates the farms to the circumstances of the lowest
class of people, and holds out to them a more independent,
though seldom a less laborious way of life than the sub-
tenants enjoy.  There are at present about 350 tenants in
the parish.  Nineteen years is the most common term of
lease.

   Farming, etc.-The old system of husbandry prevailed
universally in this place till about 40 years ago, when the
introduction of lime gave it a new turn.  Watering began
to be used here about the same time with apparent success;
but experience at last shewed it to be unfit for this soil.
Water, however, has been applied in this country in gene-
ral only for raising crops of corn; and, perhaps, if watered
meadows were laid out in the accurate manner in which
they have been done in Wiltshire, and other counties in
the south of England, they may be, allowing for the diffe-
rence of climate, nearly equally beneficial here.  Soon
after water began to be used as a manure, the sowing of
turnip and grass-seeds was introduced into the parish, and
since this was generally practised, agriculture has under-
gone little alteration.  Lime is always the first step in im-
provement, and the farm is afterwards managed by white
and green crops and pasture.  Some persons have esta-
blished a regular rotation of crops on their farms; but
this is very far from being the general practice.  The short-
