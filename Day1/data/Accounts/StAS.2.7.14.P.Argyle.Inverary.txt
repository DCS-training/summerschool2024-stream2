only remaining tree of along avenue of the same kind which extend-
ed towards the Duke's office-houses, and which was also supposed
to be planted by the Marquis of Argyle.
   In 1771, another great addition was made to the plantations.
Johii Duke of Argyle (father of the late and present Duke) plant-
ed in 1805 the hill above the Douloch, on the north-west.  The
late Duke in 1807 and 1808 planted the whole of that bill called
Stron-shira, an important and valuable addition to the woods.
From that period till 1831, the woods were less attended to, but
at that date draining was begun as a preparative to further plant-
ing, and since, they have been rapidly increasing in extent, beau-
ty, and quality.The vacancies which time or former partial
planting caused inthe enclosures are now in the course of being
filled up, and itwas proposed by the late Duke to go over the
whole in about twenty years.  The course of improvement was be-
gun in the spring of 1832, and was carried on annually * at the
following, rate

The plan is still carried on, and its completion will add much to
the value and beauty of the parish.
   The lands on which these were planted were formerly enclosed
and supplied with many seedlings and stools.  For the most part
also, they were heathy moor soil, more or less precipitous and
rocky, being peat moss,ineumbent on clay, or a sandy loam, or a
light gravelly siliceous earth.
   The only preparation of which such soils are capable, are fen-
cing and draining.  They receive both.  The plants chosen are
