river and sea side: all the rest, equal to about the half
of the whole extent of the parish, is moor.
   The air is pure, the climate comparatively temperate
and mild, and the situation consequently healthy.  The
most prevalent complaint seems to be rheumatism,
which may proceed chiefly from an inattention to wet
clothes, and from the cold N. E. winds in spring.  It has
been long said, that the low part of Murray has 40 days
more of fair weather in the year than any other coun-
try in the N. of Scotland; and this part of it towards
Spey is reckoned the driest part of the country.  And
there is no doubt, that from April to October, we have
generally much more dry weather than the countries
in the neighbourhood.  Indeed, what the farmer fears
most, in the low part of Murray, is the droughts that
often take place here in the month of July.  But it may
be observed, that the lightness and thinness of our soil
in general renders it particularly liable to injury from
drought.  For the same reason, a showery summer is
very favourable to it, and even that quantity of rain,
which is very hurtful in most parts of Scotland through
the summer, and especially in the higher parts of the
country in this neighbourhood, is beneficial through the
greatest part of the low country of Murray, and espe-
cially in this parish.  Accordingly, in the year 1782,
when there was such a failure in the crop through the
greatest part of Scotland, from the excessive rains, it is
believed, there was a sufficiency here for the consump-
tion of the country; and that many of our farmers made
more profit than usual by that crop, from the high
prices.  It has been observed by many, that the sum-
mers have been more rainy since the year 1782, than
for a considerable time before, and that the crops in our
