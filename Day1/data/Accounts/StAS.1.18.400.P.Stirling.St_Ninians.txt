     Statistical Account

   But be the causes what they will, the fact is undeniable,
that a considerable degree of intelligence is possessed by the
great body of the people.

   Poor.-The poor are well supported.  The number of vil-
lages, the vicinity of the coal and lime-works, the ease with
which feuars build houses, and the low rent at which they
can afford to let them, have induced many indigent people to
take up their residence in this parish.  After many attempts
to ameliorate the condition of the poor had been made and
abandoned by the Heritors and Kirk Session, the present
scheme was in the year 1774, adopted by the county of Stir-
ling.  The poor live in their own houses, and receive a
monthly pension, according to their circumstances.  A com-
mittee of residing heritors, the minister, some elders, and
other parishioners, meet on the first Thursday of every month,
and superintend the payments made to the poor, according to
a roll made up by the committee at a private meeting.
   The funds are raised from,
   1. An assessment on the land at a certain rate, per cent.
the one half payable by the proprietors, the other by the
tenants, according to their respective valued rents.  This
rate is fixed at a general meeting, held annually for the
purpose.  The rate has never been below 12 s per L. 100
valued rent, nor above 16 s, except in 1783, when it rose
to 18 s.
   2. A voluntary contribution from the inhabitants of the
villages.
   3. The balance of the Session funds, after paying the usual
accounts.
   4. The produce of the deceased pensioners effects, sold by
public auction.
