   Means of Improvement.-From the geographical view of
this country, it will occur to the attentive observer, that the
condition of the inhabitants appears to admit of little me-

factures, the country is ill calculated.  Till the country be
enclosed, artificial grass cannot be raised; and enclosures
would be attended with an expense disproportionate to their
circumstances, as the farms are broken and discontiguous;
besides, that to succeed in this branch of husbandry, they
would be obliged to dispense with sheep, at present their staple
commodity.  Upon the supposition that such a change should
happen, as the people are far from the market, grass would
become a drug upon their hands; and to substitute it in place
of straw for provender, would not indemnify them for the
expense.  Such reasoning may be fallacious, but it is their
own, and hitherto has determined them to follow the practice
of their ancestors, to which they have invariably adhered, ex-
cept in the articles of turnips and potatoes.  Of these, they
raise a considerable quantity, what may be equal to two
months of the annual consumption of the whole inhabi-

   Manufactures.-In this parish, there are 4 mills; the mul-
tures of these together, will scarce amount to 80 bolls of
meal, and this quantity multiplied by 32, the proportion paid
to each, will make the whole quantity of victual raised in
the country 2560 bolls.  When this number is divided by
1276 individuals, it will be found, that each will have little
more to live upon, during the year, than 2 bolls of meal, be-
