     of Dunnottar.

lands, enclosing and planting have been rapidly carried for-
ward.  Hard wood and larches are found to succeed best, par-
ticularly the latter.  Scotch firs are most backward.-The
most general crops of grain are bear and oats, with very little
barley, and no wheat.  Turnips and potatoes are likewise
very much cultivated.  The culture of turnips particularly,
has been greatly extended, which here succeed remarkably
well.  Formerly they were chiefly used for fattening cattle;
but, of late, the high price, have induced most people to use
them for rearing.  They are commonly sown in broad cast
with most advantage, the soil being generally dry, A con-
siderable quantity of clover and rye-grass is now sown; but
not so much as is requisite for good farming; the horses being
chiefly fed upon straw, and the ground not sufficiently rested
after improvement by fallow and lime.

   State of Property.-A very accurate map of this county
was executed in the year 1774; by which it appears, that in
the parish of Dunnottar there are 6418 Scotch acres; of
which about 3600 may be supposed arable, the rest being
green pasture and moor.  The greatest part of the land lies
open; and much of it is let in small parcels, from 4 to 10
acres.  The rent is various, according to the different soils
and the distance from Stonehaven, being from 8 s. to 2 L. per
acre.  Few farms are above 50 L. rent.  The whole rent of the
parish is about 2100 L.  The heritors are 4 in number, of
whom only 1 resides within its bounds.

   Cattle.-The labour is here chiefly performed by horses;
there being 188 work horses in the parish, and only 24 oxen.
-There is only 1 farm in the parish with a stock of sheep;
but they have never been attended with any success.
