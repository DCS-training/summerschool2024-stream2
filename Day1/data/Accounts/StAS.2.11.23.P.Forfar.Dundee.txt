turkeys from 3s. to 4s.; and pigeons, 7d. per pair.
   Live Stock.-There are no sheep bred or fattened for sale within
the parish. The Dundee fleshers purchase their sheep fat in the
north country markets, and keep them till they have occasion for
them in grass parks in the neighbourhood in summer, and feed
them with turnips in winter. There are few cattle but milch cows
kept.  Those kept in the town are of all kinds; those belonging
to the farmer are selected with care. None of the short-horned
breed, however, have yet been introduced, their superior qualities
being little known in this part of the country.
   Husbandry.-The farm-buildings are pretty good. The greater
part of them are built of stone and lime, and slated. They are of
a square form generally, the space within being used as a straw-
yard for cattle. The fences are stone dikes, with a few hedges;
but little attention is paid to fences near the town, where there is
no pasturage. At a distance, particularly at Craigie, Pitkerro, and
Duntrune, where the fields are let for pasture, the fences are in the
best state. The dikes are substantially built of stone, from four to
five feet high, and cost for building about 10s. per rood.
   The ordinary length of the lease of a farm is nineteen years.
The rent is paid in money; but sometimes estimated in grain, as
well as in money, converted according to the fiars of the year. The
terms of payment are Candlemas and Lammas for the half years
preceding these terms respectively.
   The land under tillage may be said to be in a very improved
state, no labour nor expense being spared to render it hhghly pro-
ductive; and there are no particular obstacles to improvement.
The following is about the average number of acres at present pro-
ducing different kinds of grain, and the annual gross amount of
raw produce:
