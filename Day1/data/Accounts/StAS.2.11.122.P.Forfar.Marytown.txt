	Alehouses,&c.--There is much reason to colplain of the num-
ber of houses licensed for selling spirits on the public roads, though
there is only one house of that description in this parish: it is on
the highway leading from Montrose to Arbroath.
	Fuel.--The fuel chiefly used is coals, brought from the harbours
of Montrose and Old Montrose, which cost 14d. or 15d. the English
barrel, weighing nine stones odds. But coals are now sold at
Montrose by the standard barrel of one and a-half hundred weight,
which on trial has been found to contain from seven to fourteen
pounds, according to the quality of the coal, more than the former
heaped measure of two imperial bushels. Wood arising from the
thinning and pruning of the forest-trees in the neigbbourhood can
also be purchased at a reasonable rate.
