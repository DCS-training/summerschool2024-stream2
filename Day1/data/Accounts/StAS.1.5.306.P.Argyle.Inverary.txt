happy effect, if proprietors would encourage and reward the
industry of farmers more than some of them do, by allowing
them a greater share of the fruits of their labour.  At pre-
sent, that is far from being always the case; the principal,
if not the sole view of many proprietors being, to augment
their rents, and to fleece their tenants as much as possible.  In
this, indeed, they are often too successful; for it is a well
known fact, that very many of that valuable class of men,

other visible cause, but solely the high rents they pay, die
poorer than when they first became farmers. There can be
no doubt, but that short leases, must be detrimental to the
improvement of a country, as well as farmers changing their
possessions, so often as they do in many places.  At the same

griculture, and possessed of substance, may be attended with
beneficial consequences.  These remarks, however, do not

the natives of this county and parish, in particular, are a high
spirited, generous, and brave race of people.  From the nature
of their country and climate, as well as their early habits,
they are inured to bear wet and cold, fatique and hunger; and 
consequently are well qualified to sustain the hardships of
the field, and have ever been distinguished for their activity
and valour, in every quarter of the globe.  They seem
not averse to a military life, and have proved an excellent
nursery to the British army.  During the last war, it may
be proper to mention, that a battalion of the 71st, almost
the whole of the 74th, and the West Fencibles, were chiefly
levied in the county of Argyle, towards which the parish
of Inveraray largely contributed its proportion.-With re-
