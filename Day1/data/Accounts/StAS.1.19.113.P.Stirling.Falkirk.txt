     of Falkirk.

The following corrections and additions to the Statistical
Account of the parish of Polmont (vol. III. p. 344.) are
here inserted, at the request of the Rev. Mr William Finlay:

   The parish of Polmont is not intersected, but bounded by the frith of
Forth, on the north, and by the river Avon on the east.  A small part of it
is intersected by short cut from Grangemouth, which is now the only
navigable communication betwixt the great canal and the Forth.  The
iron stone is sold by the proprietors of land to the Carron Company, not at
tenpence per stone, but at tenpence per ton.  The annual amount of the
funds for relief of the poor is not L. 28, but about L. 55, and the expendi-
ture nearly the same.  By an interlocutor of the Teind Court, June 1793,
the stipend of this parish is ordained to be 111 bolls, 2 firlots, 1 peck, and
2 lippies of bear, 56 bolls of meal, and L. 152: 10: 10 Scots money, with
L. 60 money foresaid for furnishing the communion-elements.  The real
rent of the parish is about L. 4000 Sterling per annum.
