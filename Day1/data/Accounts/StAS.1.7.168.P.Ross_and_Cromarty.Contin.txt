     Statistical Account

to be observed was, that although these years produced little
or no corn, they were particularly favourable for the growth
of grass, which yielded immense quantities of milk, the prin-
cipal support of the inhabitants; and the kind providence of
God was very remarkably seen towards the poorer fort, in
causing the sheep and goats, the only cattle they had, to yield
greater quantities, and more fruitful milk, than they were
ever known to do before, or ever since.  Another favourable
circumstance for the inhabitants was, that there was a great
demand for cattle, (the staple commodity of the parish), and
that they sold at high prices.
