     Transmitted by PROFESSOR G. JARDINE, in the Name of the

     INTRODUCTION.
   TO give a distinct account of the University of Glasgow,
it is necessary to distinguish two periods of its exist-
ence, in which its constitution and appearance were extreme-
ly different;-the period before the reformation from Popery,
and that which followed it; to which may be subjoined, the
present state of the University, with such alterations, in the
mode of conducting education, as the improvements in litera-
ture, and the state of society, have suggested.
