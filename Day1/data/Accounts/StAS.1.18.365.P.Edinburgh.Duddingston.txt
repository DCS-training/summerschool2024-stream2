earth, seldom exceeding 16 inches in depth, and often not
attaining to so much; towards the east, inclined to and rest-
ing on a strong clay; and near the sea-coast degenerating into
a light, but with culture not unproductive, sand.  Agriculture
has been carried to a high degree of perfection; though it
must be confessed, from the circumstances of situation, there
is little scope here for the exercise of ingenuity, or the inven-
tion of resources in the application of the art.  The great
medium of improvement is the manure of Edinburgh; and
the great object of ambition, is the multiplying of wheat
crops.  These by the command of manure, can be often
forced upon the soil before the return of any ordinary rotation
of crops would permit their introduction.  The fallowing,
drill, pasture, and turnip husbandry, are little practised in
this neighbourhood, from the dearness of the ground; and
the easy though expensive acquisition of the richest manure.
Crops of artificial grass and clover are frequently introduced,
generally cut twice in the season, and seldom allowed to re-
main above two years upon the ground.  Often the greater
part of both crops is sublet and retailed in bunches in Edin-
burgh, at 1 d 1/2 the bunch, the standing price, though the
bunch itself varies in size, according to the season, crop, etc.
Potatoes are also a staple commodity, often sublet like clover at
L. 8, and even L. 10 per acre.  Barley, oats, pease, as usual
have their place, though the last as seldom as possible; but
assuredly the finest crops of each species of grain that can be
seen any where, are raised here.  Grounds that are kept in
pasture, are seldom occupied by sheep to any extent; but are
generally grazed by milk cows, and road horses from the
neighbouring city; and these pay in the summer months 8d
per night for each horse, and 6 d per cow.
