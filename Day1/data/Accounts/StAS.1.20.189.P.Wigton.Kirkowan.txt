stated was L.820.  The present incumbent, in 1792, stated
the rent to the same Court at somewhat above L.2200.
Since that time the rent has been considerably advanced.
The inrease of the rental, in the period above mentioned, is,
no doubt, principally owing to the increase of prices.  The
enlargement of farms, and the farmer's better manage-
ment of his flocks, have likewise had their effect in raising
the value of lands in their possession.  The mode of ma-
nagement among the farmers, for some time past, has been,
to keep fewer beasts, and to feed them better.  The far-
mer no doubt, finds his account in pursuing this plan, and
of course, part of the profit will go to the proprietor.  A
similar observation will hold good with respect to the en-
largement of farms He person who employs the greatest
stock in trade can afford to deal upon the least profit.

   Population.-The population of this parish has evidently
described within these 40 years.  According to my prede-
cessor's account, about that time it is amounted to 800 fouls.
At present it is somewhat below 700.  The population of
a village at the church has considerably increased duting
the period above mentioned; of course, the decrease of po-
lulation has happened solely among the possecssors of land.
This is easily accounted for from the enlargement of farms.
The same farm which formerly contained several tenants,
is now, in most places, occupied by one only.  Though our
population has decreased in the course of 40 years, yet for
a considerable time of the latter part of than period it ap-
pears to have been stationary.  The average number of
births exceed that of funerals; but the surplus of our popu-
lation goes to supply or increase the population of other
places.  The return to Dr Webster in 1755, was 795
fouls.
