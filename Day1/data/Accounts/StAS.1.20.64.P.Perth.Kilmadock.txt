which should be covered with corn.  Until the practice of
laying down fields with sown grass was introduced, every
farmer preserved the round bullets of stones on his fields
very sacredly; but, when they came to cut the hay, these
supposed friends proved noted enemies to the scythes, and, 
at length, drove the farmer to the necessity of turning off
the stones to save his instruments; and thus mere necessity
introduced the practice of clearing ground of stones.  Hence
it may easily be marked, in the parish of Kilmadock, what
fields have been under the culture of grass, from the smooth
surface.
   4. Trenching.-The most effectual method of draining, le-
velling, and clearing of stones, those fields that are wet and
spongy, is to trench the whole; yet this useful art is not
known here.  Trenching, though expensive in the mean
time, isthe cheapest of all improvements in the end.  The
reason that farmers soon tire of draining their fields is,
because they seldom happen to discover the true springs;
and, when they still observe the water overflowing their
fields, they become dispirited, and never make another at-
tempt.  The same is the case with stony fields: Though the
farmer one year clean the surface of stones, the next plough-
ing turns up as many; and country people, beingsoon dis-
couraged, give up the contest.  By trenching the field, the
real origin of the springs are discovered, and every stone
that obstructs the plough can be taken out.  In going over
the field, the trenchers have no more to do than place a
stake wherever they find a spring; and, when the whole field
is dressed, it can then be considered where the common drain
should be placed, so as to communicate with the springs thus
discovered.  The best drain for such fields is a ditch, filled
half up with the round stones taken out of the field, and co-
vered over with a sufficient depth of earth.  A field thus
