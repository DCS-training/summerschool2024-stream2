title to exact half multure out of the produce of a mini-
ster's glebe.  This is a practice prevalent here, and in some
other parishes.  The services paid by the tenant to the

of peats yearly; they also yearly, or occasionally, bring
wood, slate, and lime to the heritor.  The carriage of ma-

mencement of Druidism.  If however, Druidism were the
first religion in this island, which must have been the case,
if peopled from Gaul, perhaps this might have been
a place where they burned fire, or performed some rite of
their-religion.  In various places there are several huge
