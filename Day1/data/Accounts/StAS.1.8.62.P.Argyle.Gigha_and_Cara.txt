<FOOTNOTE>

*There is no physician, surgeon, or apothecary in the parish, nor any to be
got nearer than Campbeltown.  Although there two islands are uncommonly
healthy, and free from epidemical disorders, yet he want of a surgeon is some-
times felt in accidental cases.  Medical assistance, is the only thing wanting, to
render the island of Gigha, a most agreeable place to yeddo in.  As there are good
harbours and landing places on the east side of the island, there is easy access to
it at all times, but the want of a quay, and proper accommodation on the main-
land opposite to it, (as formerly taken notice of,) renders the communication
difficult in the winter season.  Were this inconvenience removed, the other
would be less felt, as medical aid, in urgent cases, could at any time be got from
Campbeltown.  The winter, however, is so mild, that there is almost a con-
stant vegetation; and in summer the beautiful situation of the place, the salu-
brity of air, and the variety of creeks and sandy bays, render it one of the finest
bathing places in the WePt Highlands.
   ++A crofter has a plot of ground, for rearing a small crop and keeping a
milk cow, and pays a yearly rent according to the value and extent of the
ground, A cottager has only a house, garden and potatoe ground, for which
he pays a small rent.
   ++Those employed at the herring fishing, receive from a guinea to 30 s. per
month for wages.  The number of vessels and small boats belonging to both
islands is a, follows:  6 sloops, from 8 to 15 tons burden; 1 ditto of 44 tons;
ditto of 69; 1 ditto of 74 registered tonnage; and 24 small boats.
