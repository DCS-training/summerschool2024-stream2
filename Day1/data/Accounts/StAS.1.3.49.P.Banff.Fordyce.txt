   Population.-The population of this parish, so far as it has
been traced, was as great formerly as at present.  This may
appear a little problematical, sonsidering the great number of
people collected together and living in Portsoy; but former-
ly there were many mosses, now exhausted, and the sides of
these mosses were crouded with cottagers, who laboured a
few acres of ground, had a little coarse flax of their own
growth, and kept a small flock of sheep, which afforded
them clothes.  These people multiplied and afforded sol-
diers, servants, and tradesmen.  The great check given to
this rank of people was first the mosses being exhausted, and
then some heritors limited by their leases the number of
subtenants, in order to have their mosses.  The return of the
population of this parish to Dr Webster was 3212.  In the
year 1782, the police of the county required an account of
the number, young and old, in the parish, in order to ascer-
tain the quantity of meal necessary to be imported.  A tole-
rably exact numeration was made, and then young and old,
amounted to about 3425.  The population since that period
has rather increased than diminished.

   The average of births according to the register of baptisms
in 1683,-4,-5, is 104; in 1783.-4,-5, 55.  It is be-
lieved, however, that there are as many, or nearly as many
births and baptisms in the parish now as formerly, and that
the difference of these two averages arises in a great mea-
sure from the inaccuracy of the baptism registers, owing to
the negligence of the people, in registering their children's
names.  During last century, there was only one minister,
and the schoolmaster was attentive to his own interest, in ob-
liging the people to register their children.  There are now
several who baptize at Portsoy, a minister of the establish-
ment,-a Seceder,-a Nonjuror who preaches every sort-
