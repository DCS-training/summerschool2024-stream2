     Parish of Mortlach.

     Additions and Corrections, by the Rev. George Gordon.

     Mission.-There has long been a mission or itinerancy in
Glenrinnes, supported by the committee for managing the
royal bounty, which greatly accommodates five or six hun-
dred people; of whom two thirds are reckoned in the parish
of Mortlach, and one third in the parish of Aberdour.  It
has been a very useful appointment; and was, most proba-
bly from a strong sense of the propriety of it, one of the
earliest of the kind.  The people are so much convinced of
its benefit, that they are just now rebuilding the meeting-
house, and giving it a slate roof, at their own expence.  It
is between 4 or 5 miles from any church.

   Society School.-There was a society school too in the same
glen, which was very serviceable; and yet it was taken away
lately:  But, it is hoped, it will soon be restored; and it
should be ambulatory betwixt Glenrinnes and Glenmarky,
a year or two in the one place, and then as long in the other.
For education and the interests of religion among the young
in this corner, such a school may be said to be almost ne-
cessary.

     The above two paragraphs should have come in imme-
     diately before the account of the poor.
