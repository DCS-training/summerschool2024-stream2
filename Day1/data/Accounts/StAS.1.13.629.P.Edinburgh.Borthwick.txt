   The other school mentioned is in a village about two
miles from the church.  Here the average number of
scholars is 28; the fees are equally low, and still worse
paid than those of the parish schoolmaster.  The teach-
er indeed has L. 3, 1 s. of salary, arising from a sum
mortified by a Sir James M'Lurg.  A school-house too has
hitherto been furnished by Mr Dewar of Vogrie, as the in-
stitution seems to have been chiefly intended for the chil-
dren of those who reside on his estate.

   Poor.-For 20 years past the number of poor has, on an
average, been about 18, and their allowance L. 2, 10 s. the
month, or L.30 a-year.  At present, indeed, their mainte-
nance amounts to upwards of L. 20 more, owing to the
session having charge of five poor orphans, who are educated,
sed, and clothed at the expense of the parish.  In the years
1775, 1776, and 1777, there was no accommodation, and
of course little or no public worship at Borthwick.  In that
case, recourse was had to an assessment, which the parties
concerned have never since got entirely rid of.  A variety of
circumstances concurred to render a partial assessment abso-
lutely necessary; and although, after such mode of support-
ing the poor was found expedient, numbers thought proper
to withdraw their collections at the church-doors, yet still
our ordinary contributions are continued, and found to be
of some consequence.  They amount to about L. 10, 125.
a-year; the pall, or morcloth money, is about L. 5:3:5.
which, with L.2, 10 s. as interest of money laid out at 5
per cent. constitutes all the regular funds on which we can
have any dependence.  The L. 50 alluded to, the heritors and
session broke upon in the memorable year 1782, but, by mu-
tual consent, they embraced the very earliest opportunity of
replacing it, that it might lie in reserve as a fund to which
they could have recourse on any extraordinary emergency.
