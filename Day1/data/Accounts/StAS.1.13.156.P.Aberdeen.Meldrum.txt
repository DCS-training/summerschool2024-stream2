for the  relief of the most necessitous*.-There is a very

scholars in summer, and 50 or 60 in winter . It would cer-

L. 30 or L. 40 altogether.  There is also a Sunday's school
well endowed by a native of the place, which promises to
be of great service to the rising generation.  It has been 
attended by 60 0r 70 children almost every Sunday during
last winter season.

tion.  Good boef and mutton are fold from 34d. 41 s. the pound;
