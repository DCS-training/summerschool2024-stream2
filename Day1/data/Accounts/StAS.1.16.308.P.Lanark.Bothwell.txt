are generally in good order; but such as are in the hands
of tenants, are imperfect.
   The slope hedge, instead of being planted upon the top,
is very unfavourable; excludes sun, rain and dew, from
the root of the plant; and the breaches of youth continue
through age.  The nursing a young hedge requires a good
deal of attention; a farmer of small extent grudges the
charge.  It would be for the interest of the proprietor to
make some allowance, or to divide the expence of rearing the
hedges for 7 or 8 years, till they are established; the far-
mer being bound to maintain them during his lease.

   Roads and Bridges.-The parish is well appointed in
roads.  The great road from Glasgow to Edinburgh, goes
through the whole length of the parish, as has been alrea-
dy noticed.  The road from Glasgow to Carlisle enters the
parish on the west, a little to the south of the Edinburgh
road, by a bridge over the Calder very near to Clyde,
goes along the pleasant banks of the river, passeth through
the village at the church, and crosses the Clyde at Both-
well bridge.  The mail coach goes the same course twice
a-day.
   There are several sections from the Edinburgh road,
crossing the parish in different places; three leading to Ha-
milton, one to Lanark, and two to Airdrie, in good order.
Besides these, there are many cross roads, made and repair-
ed by the statute-work.  It is converted at the rate of 15 s.
per plough-gate; the annual amount is L. 80: 8: 9 1/2.  The
turnpike and statute roads put together, amount to about
50 miles; 22 of which are good turnpike,-a provision
rarely to be found in one parish, but which must facilitate
the improvement, and enhance the value of the landed pro-
perty.
