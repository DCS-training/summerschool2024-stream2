south appears like the sea in a calm; while the hills on the
north seem to raise like islands out of the main, or like the
tumultuous waves of the ocean in a storm.
   Though there is scarcely a peep between any of the hills to
the north, yet there is an infinite variety of scenery of every
kind to the south.  The friths of Forth and Clyde, with the
islands they contain; a vast variety of lakes and rivers, woods
and wilds, with innumerable rich corn fields and inclosures;
the great canal, and villages, towns, cities, and shires, add
beauty, variety, and grandeur to the whole.

   Soil.-Where there is such an uneven surface, there must
of course be a great variety of soil.  In general a light sandy
or gravelly bottom is most prevalent; excepting in the rich,
beautiful, and extensive valley west of the town.  It consists
of a rich loamy fertile soil, from 2 to 2 1/2 feet thick; and con-
tains upwards of 600 acres.  The west barony is upon the
whole the richest; approaching often to clay: the east is more
gravelly.  In some places the surface is almost entirely covered
with small stones, from the quarter of a pound to two or three
pounds weight.  These, however, are not supposed to be inju-
rious, but rather an advantage to the soil.  They are said to pre-
vent the ground from heaving and casting the seed in spring,-
to shelter the tender blade in summer.  They are supposed like-
wise to prevent the scorching rays of the sun from withering
the corns,-to retain the moisture in great drought; and, by
retaining also the heat all the summer night, to promote ve-
getation.  Perhaps the principal advantage is generally over-
looked; which is, that they throw off a kind of laminous
rind or shell, like the coats of an onion, which, being mixed
with calcareous earth, moulders down and meliorates the
grounds.  The sandy soil which prevails here, though light
and shallow, is generally productive; always easily cultivated,
