have hitherto hindered, and still must impede the improve-
ment of our country.  The principal of which, is short
leases, which (except in the instances mentioned above) never
exceed 19 years, often not so many.  When the farmer en-
ters upon the possession of his farm, he generally proceeds
with great spirit in improving it according to his ability, and
sometimes even beyond it, for the first 10 or 12 years of his
lease; but being sensible that this will only tempt others to
envy and supplant him, and the more so, as there are so few
instances of farms to be had, but in an exhausted state; he
therefore not only stops short in his improvements, but con-
tinues to scourge the ground to the expiration of his lease, as
the proprietor is not inclined to renew his lease with him,
till it is upon the point of expiring.  And thus, after all he
has done upon it, his farm is left by him in as bad, if not
a worse condition, than when he entered to it.  Another
hinderance to improvement, is the time necessarily taken up
in cutting and bringing home peats for the tenants them-
selves, and leet peats (as they are called) for their landlords;
this takes up most of the summer, the most proper season for
carrying on their improvements.  Add to this, their straiten-
ed circumstances, the rents of their farms being doubled, and
in several instances more, in the last 30 years, and upon the
expiration or fall of a lease, fines or grassums being still paid,
and that to a pretty high extent, though the ground still con-
tinues in its pristine, or in a worse, state: and the only ad-
vantage, the present tenant has over his then predecessors, is
little higher price for his grain, and the advanced price of
cattle: and to balance this, the expense of managing his farm
is in that period of time almost tripled.  It is hoped, how-
ever, that the proprietors of land will see their mistake, and
grant their tenants longer leases; for it is the settled opinion
of the most intelligent people in this country, that if tenants
