The inhabitants of the two parishes amounting to 24,592;
therefore the proportion between the deaths of last year and
the population over the whole district of town and country,
is as one to 40.98.
   In the ten years, 1771-1780, the deaths to the births

somewhat more.  In this last manner were the returns from
the several districts in this parish generally made.  The above
number includes dissenters of every denomination:  They are
mostly Burghers, Antiburghers, and members of the Relief

perhaps two or three Papists.  The Burgher-Seceders, and
