        the water; but, like all similar objects of superstitious revdrence, it
        is fast losing its repute.  It is supposed by antiquarians, that this
        relic, as well as several others of a similar kind, is of Druidical
        workmanship.  One precisely similar in every respect to this, is to
        be seen on the top of the Scottish sceptre preserved in the Castle
        of Edinburgh.  Some have asserted that this kind of stone was
        the official badgeof the.  Archdruids.
           Mansion-Houses.--The chief modern buildings in the parish
        are, the mansion-houses of Dunir`, Aberuchill, Ardvorlich, Dal-
        honzie, and Comrie House.  The parish church is a plain, sub-
        stantial building, with a spire, forming a striking feature in the
        landscape.  An excelledt parish school has lately been erected.

                                III.-POPULATION.
           The amount of population, so far as it can be traced, has varied
        little for upwards of a century.
             Dr Webster in 17-55 stated it to be,                                       2546
             At the period of the last Statistical Account, it was said to be,          3000
             The Parliamentary census of 1800 stated it at,                             2458
             The census of                    1811                                      2689
                                              1821                                      2614
                                              1831                                      2622

           The population of the district annexed qunad sacra to Btilqu-
        hidder, which at present amounts to 205, so far as known, has
        never been counted in this parish, unless perhaps by the writer of
        the last Statistical Account.
           The soil and situation of the parish form a natural barrier against
        the increase of population.  Education having been general since
        the beginning of last century by means of the parish schhool, and
        by several schools maintained by the Society for Propagating
        Chri,itian Knowledge, the people were enterprising and ready to
        etnigmte - ben they felt straitened at home.  Many have emigrat-
        ed to Canada, during the last twenty or thirty years.  The system
        of enlarging the farms and introducing sheep greatly diminished
        the agricultural population at the beginning of this century; but
        the villageswhich were then in process of being feud,kept up the
        population of the parish at its usual amount. The highwar prices
        of hand-loom weaving, at the same time, encouraged the village
        system.  The village population at present amounts to l666, and
        the country population to 1010.
