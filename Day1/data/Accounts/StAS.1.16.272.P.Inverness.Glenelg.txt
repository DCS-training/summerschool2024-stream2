valued, including the glebe, at L. 12; so that the value of
the whole living amounts to L. 115: 18: 11 11/12.  The pre-
sent minister was admitted in the year 1782, is married,
and has five children, three sons and two daughters.  His
predecessors in office were Messrs Donald Macleod, Mur-
doch Macleod, and John Morrison.  The church is situated
near the sea, and is in tolerable good order.  The manse,
by being built on an eminence, is much exposed to the
westerly winds; and though repaired in the year 1785, is
far from being at present in a sufficient state.  Colonel Mac-
leod of Macleod is patron, of the parish.

   School.-The school-house stands at the distance of a
short mile from the church.  During the summer, the num-
ber of scholars that attend may be about 45.  The salary
is 300 merks Scots, paid by the Laird of Macleod and the
tenants of his estate; the other districts were never cessed
with any proportion; the emoluments arising to the school-
master are trifling, so that his income will not much exceed
L. 20 Sterling.  It is melancholy to think, that in every
part of Scotland so little attention should be paid to the
most useful members of society.  In this district there is a
school, solely at the expence of the inhabitants, who send
their children to it; the number of boys and girls that at-
tend are 38.  In Knowdort, there is one of the Society
schools; the teacher has a salary of L. 12 Sterling allowed
him; and scholars are from 30 to 40 in number.

   Poor.-The number of poor on the roll of this parish at
present is 31; they seldom or ever travel to beg elsewhere;
are supported chiefly by the inhabitants, only in summer
they receive a small supply in meal from the funds col-
lected upon Sundays, which at an average come to L. 7 or
L. 8 Sterling a-year.
