list of examinable persons, the proportion of males to fe-
male, was as 5 to 7.  The decrease of adult males is owing
to their leaving the parish.  Numbers of young men go to
the south of Scotland, as handicraftmen, or labourers: Se-

about 20: but this cannot be so exactly ascertained, as seve-

may be about 6.
