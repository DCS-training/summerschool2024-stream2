riod, perhaps 50.  The valued rent of the parish is L. 2068,
10s. Scots.  The real rent may be about L. 2000 Sterling.
The rent of land varies.  Such farms as have been given in
lease about 30 years ago, may pay from 7s. to 10s. for the
acre of arable ground.  Farms that have been lately let, pay
from 15 s. to 20 s. the acre.

   Crops.-The principal crops in the parish are barley and
oats; pease is not so common.  Lint is sown in small quan-
tities for family use.  The common tenants and cottagers
raise a great many potatoes in proportion to their acres, de-
pending upon them chiefly for subsistence.  The proprietors
amd gentlemen tenants follow the Norfolk method of hus-
bandry.  They sow wheat, turnip, and grass-seeds.  They
use the English plough, drawn by two horses, withour a
driver.  The farms in the hand of the proprietors and bet-
ter tenants, are inclosed; the rest of the parish is open.
Wheat is sown from the middle of October to the middle of 
November; oats and pease in the end of March and be-
ginning of April; barley from the end of April to the be-
ginning of June; lint the beginning of May; turni from
the middle of June to the middle of July,  The harvest is
seldom begun before September; and if the crop is got in
about the middle of October, they reckon it in good time.
A greater quantity of every species of grain than is neces-
sary for the maintenance of the inhabitants is raised; at the 
same time, victual gives a high price, and meal is sometimes
scarce, because the barley is wholly consmed by the distil-
leries.
