     Statistical Account

   Climate, Floods, and Prospects.-The air is rather moist;
the country flat, with a very small rise for some miles; the
diseases are consumptions and fevers, tending to putrid.  The
tide rises some miles above the place, or at least forces
back the water of the river; and the water itself sometimes
tastes salt of brakish.  The village and lands near the river
are subject to pinundations, but they are seldom great.
There have been two remarkable floods, however, in the
years 1712 and 1782.  On the 12th March 1782, boats
might have sailed through many streets in Gorbals, as they
really did on that occasion in the Bridgegate of Glasgow.
The whole ground appeared sea for a mile west, and about an
eighth of a mile from the river, a small island appearing a-
bout the south end of the church, and the field west from
it.  The church was filled with water, except about 3 pews
in the south end.-There are a variety of prospects from
Gorbals; as Langred, (where the battle between Queen
Mary and the Barons was fought, about two miles south),
the Isle of Arran, Paisley, the windings of the river Clyde,
Benlomond, which often appears with a snowy top when
the season is advanced, and Tintock, from above Lanark.

   Rent, Soil, and Minerals.-The grounds rents high, being
set for 19 years past, from L. 3 to L. 5 an acre; the soil is va-
rious, some of it a black strong loan, others a rich clay, and
much of it, where the Gorbals is situated, sand some fathoms
deep, little more than 9 inches soil in the surface.  It abounds
with coal.  The Govan colliery has two excellent machines,
the one for drawing up the water, the other a steam-engine
for bringing up coals 100 fathoms, which saves a number of
horse.  There are 3 seams of coal, the undermost 14 feet
thick.  It is thought that there is such a quantity of coals
in the colliery, (which belongs to Dunlop and Houston,) as
