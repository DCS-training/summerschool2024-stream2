for 1 s 3 d.-and a hen for 8 d. or 9 d. each;-eggs at 2 d. the do-
zen;-rabbits, (of which, there is a good warren on the bay of
Luce) 5 d. the pair;-butter 8 d.-and common cheese 3 d.
the pound of 24 ounces.  The average price of well dressed
oats is rather below L. 1. per boll, of 12 Winchester bushels;
-of common bear, about L. 1: 1;-and of two rowed bar-
ley, generally L. 1: 6, per ditto.  A day labourer, if he finds
his own victuals, receives 1 s. per day;-carpenters and ma-
sons from 1 s 6 d. to 1 s 10 d.  Were it not for the influx of the
Irish, the price of the labour would have become insuppor-
tably high.

   Services-There are various services performed by the te-
nants, to the resident heritors, such as cutting peats, and car-
rying them to the manor house, cutting down corn, and some-
times ploughing and harrowing.  Baillie work, as it is term-
ed, is common over the whole county of Wigton.

   Manufactures.-Some years ago, fast was manufactured at
two places in this parish; but the practice is now discontinu-
ed, probably, because it was found earlier to smuggle that ar-
ticle from Ireland.  This business, however, might be revived
with advantage to the public and to the undertakers, particu-
larly if the fisheries should prove successful.  There is some
kelp made here every year, and generally exported to Ireland.
The coarse yarn spun by the old women, is usually brought to
the fairs, of which two are held every year, in this parish,
and there readily bought up to be made into osnaburghs for
the West Indian market.  There is in this parish a bleachfield,
and four mills for dressing flax, also a very excellent mill for
making pot or pearl barley, constructed by an ingenious me-
chanic from Edinburgh, with a view of preparing that article
for the Liverpool market.
