     Statistical Account

of men; and much delicacy, in this regard, is no doubt re-
quisite.  It might tend, perhaps, to check the evil, were
every agricultural servant, by law, obliged to produce to the
master with whom he engages, and to the church session of
the parish, when required, a certificate from the master
whom he left, granted before two legal witnesses, of the
wages which he received, and of the discretion, fidelity, and
diligence, which he maintained during the period of his pre-
ceding service; the engaging master to forfeit equal to a
quarter of year's wages, and the servant as much, to the pa-

covered at the instance of the cashier of the session, by the
warrant of one justice of the peace, or other judge ordinary,
in the same summary manner in which the fines are levied
on the absentees from the statute labour on the roads.
   Those who have been attentive to the operation of any
new law, will be able perhaps to form a judgment of the ef-

appear that it could be attended with much inconvenience to
either party; and, while it would, in general, prevent im-
position on the master who engages, by an exaggerated ac-
count of the wages paid by the last master, as is now so ge-
nerally the case, it would, in many instances, have the effect
of rendering the servant discreet and diligent during the
term of his service, when so much as a quarter's wages de-
pended on his behaviour.
   Other improvements respecting diet, and the hours of la-
bour, might be suggested; but it is probable the effect alone
of the certificate may render these unnecessary: At any rate,
if regulations respecting the contract between master and
servant shall be taken under the consideration of Legislature,
