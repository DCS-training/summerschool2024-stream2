                      PARISH OF NEW DEER.

               PRESBYTERY OF DEER, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

                  THE REV. JAMES WELSH, MINISTER.

                 I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-NEW DEER was originally a part of the ancient parish
of Deer, from which it was disjoined not long-after the Revolution.
It is termed in the ancient records Auchreddy, from the name of
the land in which the church is situated.  This name is engraved
on the communion cups and plates, with the date 1694.  Like
other Scottish names, it is of Gaelic origin, as are many other
names in the parish, such as Auchoach, Auchmaliddy, Auchna-
gatt, Auchmunziel.
   Extent, &c.-It is one of the largest parishes in the county of
Aberdeen.  Its greatest length from north to south is upwards of
14 miles.  Its greatest breadth from east to west upwards of 8 1/2
miles.  Its contents upwards of 50 square miles.
   Boundaries.-It is bounded on the north, by the parishes of Stri-
chen, Tyrie, and Aberdour; on the west, by the parishes of King
Edward, Monquhitter, Methlic, and Tarves; on the south, by the
parish of Ellon; on the east, by the parish of Old Deer.
   Topographical Appearances.-With the exception of the hill of
Mormond, New Deer is the highest ground in Buchan.  No part
of it, however, rises higher than 200 or 300 feet above the level
of the sea. From the bill of Culsh, in the neighbourhood of the
village, may be seen in a clear day the spire of Peterhead, about
eighteen miles distant to the eastward.  And, looking west, may
be seen Bennachie, about twenty-five or twenty-eight miles, off,
the Foudland Hills, the hills in the neighbourbood of Banff and
Cullen, and Benriones, in the county of Moray.  The elevation
of the hill of Cross Gight is rather higher than that of Culsh.
   Hydrography.-There are no streams that deserve the name
of rivers in this parish, the country being in general flat and all
arable.  It will give some idea of its elevation to mention; that
