price of barley low; and consequently the spirits, which
are generally of a bad quality, are sold at a low price,
which has a tendency to destroy both the constitutions and
the morals of the people, for punch and dram-drinking are
now too generally substituted in the public houses in place
of beer, which was a much more wholesome beverage;
and the heavy excise on malt, which is also rigorously en-
forced by the distillers for obvious reasons, tends to pro-
duce the same effect and also to prevent poor people from
having malt or beer in their own houses, the want of
which proves very hurtful to the health and constitutions
of the labouring poor; and when a poor man has a boll of
barley to dispose of, he can hardly sell it at all, or only at
a very low price, generally what the distiller pleases to
give; whereas before the establishment of distilleries, and
the additional excise on malt, a poor man made his boll of
bear into malt, and paid the duty for it, and then distilled
from it an excellent spirit, which he sold at a high price
to the rich, and thus obtained a good price for his grain,
and the grains and offals helped to maintain, and often to
preserve the lives of his cattle when provender was scarce;
now the whole advantages that were before enjoyed by
the poor, are, by the distillery law, thrown into the hands
of the rich distillers, (for none cars be distillers upon the
present plan but the comparatively rich), while malt and
beer are in a manner entirely prohibited*.

<FOOTNOTE>

   *The impolicy as well as oppression of the distillery law will appear
from this circumstance, that a distiller takes out a licence for a 40 gallon
still, for which he pays a duty to Government of L. 40 a-year, and an
officer employed to attend that still receives a salary of L. 50 a-year.
The heavy excise on malt also, which in effect amounts to a total prohi-
bition, necessarily promotes smuggling, which is always injurious to mo-
rals, as well as hurtful to the revenue; and it is universally thought, that
Government does by no means draw so much from the northern counties
