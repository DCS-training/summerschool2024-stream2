former a separate charge, and to annex Navar to the latter.

Navar and Lethnot, thus united, lie in the county of Forfar,
the presbytery of Brechin, and the synod of Angus and
Mearns.  They are surrounded by the Grampian hills
on all sides, except towards the east, where there is a small
opening, through which the West-water issues, and the plain
of the Mearns is seen.  The only part of the Grampians,
that lies to the south of them, is the hill of Caterthun, re-
markable for having on its top the remains of a very anci-
ent fortification.  Opposite to Caterthun, which is the high-
est top of a long ridge, running nearly from east by north
to west by south, are the Grampians on the north, nearly
in a parallel direction to the long ridge of Caterthun, but
much higher.  Along the bottom of these, Navar and
Lethnot are situated, the breadth of the arable land from the
bottom of Caterthun on the south to the uncultivated parts of
the higher Grampians on the north, being nearly 3-4ths of a
mile all along, and the length about 5 miles.  Lethnot, which
lies eastward, is bounded on that quarter by the parish of 
Edzel, and part of the parish of Stricathrow, on the south-
east and south by the eastern part of the ridge of Cater-
thun, which separates it from the parish of Menmuir; on
the west by the West-water, which separates it from Navar; 
and on the north, by that part of the Grampians, called the
bill of Wirran, of the hill of springs, (as the word Wirran is
said to signify,) which separates it from the parish of Loch-
lee.  Navar is bounded on the south and south west by the
western part of the ridge of Caterthun, which divides it
from Menmuir; on the west it is separated from the Glens
of Fern, Tannadice, Cortachy and Clova, by a great extent
of the Grampian mountains; and towards the north, others
of these mountains divide it from the parish of Lochlee.
But besides that part of the parishes, which is situated as
above described, there is a considerable number of small
