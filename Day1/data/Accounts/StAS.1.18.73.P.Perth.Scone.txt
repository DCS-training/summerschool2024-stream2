the Viscount of Stormont, grandfather of the present Earl
of Mansfield, about seventy years ago.  Three haw-thorn trees
at the house of Kinkarochie are remarkable for their size.
The largest covers with its top a circle, on the earth, 14
yards in diameter; and measures round the middle of the
trunk, 9 feet.  The old wood consists chiefly of Scotch firs,
planes, ashes, elms, and horse chesnuts.  The firs have been
of the greatest service for building, fuel, and other purposes.
The trees, in the young plantations, are the Scotch fir, the
larch, the spruce fir, and various other sorts.  All of them
were planted within the last x8 years, and are in a very
thriving state.
   The breed of horses and cattle has of late been much
improved, partly by their being better fed, and partly by a
better kind being introduced.  The Countess of Mansfield, a
patroness of husbandry, has led the way, by introducing a
breed of cattle, remarkable for their size and shape.  Her
Ladyship, has also turned her attention towards improving
the breed of sheep, by bringing to that extensive lawn, in
which the house of Scone is situated, a flock, partly of the
Warwick shire breed, so much esteemed for their carcases
and partly of the Spanish, so remarkable for the fineness of
their wool.  The English breed answers very well; but the
experiment upon the Spanish has not yet been fully made.
Except 30 or 40, all the sheep in the parish are her Lady-
ship's property.

   Agriculture.-It appears from the face of the country,
from those rough grounds and moor-lands, which within
a few years, have been converted into beautiful and fer-
tile corn-fields, that modern husbandry is well understood
by the farmers.  Some of them adopt the following rotation
of crops; fallow, wheat, pease and beans, or other green
