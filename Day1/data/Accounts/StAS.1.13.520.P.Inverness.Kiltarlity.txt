the middle of the garden runs a fine clear stream, which
formerly had two Chinese bridges over it, and was reple-

But the rivulet passing through the garden, and the hot-

upwards of 800 yards, so that with favourable seasons, a
considerable quantity of fine fruit is produced on wall-
trees.  There are besides a great number of good
standard trees in this garden.  On two standard apple-trees

than the ordinary glebes in this country, but the soil is
very thin and poor.-The emoluments of the parochial
school are 18 bolls 1 firlot and 2 pecks of barley, 1 s. the
