   Alterations.-It is the opinion of the most intelligent per-
sons of all ranks, that the population of this part of the coun-
try has increased greatly in the space of the last 30 years.  And
that it is unquestionable that during the last 25 years the coun-
try in general, and this parish in particular, have made a great
progress in wealth, in agriculture, and those improvements con-
nected with it.
   The rent is increased at least one half, and the value of land
is nearly double.-One tenant bestows as much in manure
for his farm as three did at that time, and horses and im-
plements of husbandry are become far more valuable.-A
that time there were only two bridges over the Forth, viz. one
at Stirling, and another at Aberfoyle, now three more are

It may be a difficult matter to effectuate an alteration of the rules of the So-
ciety, but surely there is reason to hope, that the great change in the circum-
stances of the Highlands that has taken place, will either occasion an altera-
tion in the terms of his Majesty's donation, or that the General Assembly will
adhere rather to the spirit, than the letter of it; and now that, from the in-
troduction of sheep into the Highlands, and other causes, a great number of the
native Highlanders have been removed and supplanted by south country gra-
ziers and shepherds; such of them as have preferred settling in the low coun-
try to emigrating to America, ought to be considered as better deserving, as
well as standing more in need of relief from his Majesty's bounty, than if they
were still permitted to dwell within the boundaries described in his donation.
-For, when living there, however remote from their parish church, they were
still under the charge of a clergyman who understood their language.-But
when removed to the low country, they are not only far distant from Gaelic
places of worship, but they have not any clergyman that understands their lan-
guage who is particularly interested in their instruction.
   As those natives of the Highlands, who have been removed to the low
country, are more in need of relief from the Society, or from his Majesty's
bounty, so, on the other hand, the present inhabitants of the Highlands are far
from being so much in need of it as their predecessors were.
   The great extent of the Highland parishes, which was one reason for the in-
stitution of the Society, and for his Majesty's donation, no doubt remains as
formerly.  But the number of the parishes is greatly diminished.
