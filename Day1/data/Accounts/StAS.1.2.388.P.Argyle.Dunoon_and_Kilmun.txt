have found the maintainance of their own poor an easy bur-
den, had the gentlemen of the county at large, exerted them-
selves to suppress beggars, at least, without the bounds of their
respective parishes, which might have been easily effected.  The sy-
nod of Argyle attempted it within these 15 or 20 years, and
prevailed upon the Justices, at their public meetings, to make
regulations concerning it; and many individuals in the county
were active in carrying these regulations into execution; in-
somuch, that a stranger beggar, for 2 or 3 years, was not to 
be seen.  But the country was not yet ripe for carrying such
a plan into effect.  Perhaps there were too many tenants in the
country, within a step of beggary, to make it desirable to be too
rigorous.  Whether this was the cause or not, all regulations to
check indiscriminate begging, have, for some years, been en-
tirely laid aside.

   Character of the People-The people of the parish are justly
accounted sober, inoffensive, and discreet; respectful to their
superiors, charitable to one another, and the young remarka-
bly attentive to their parents, who often stand in need of their
assistance, when they grow old.-The general relaxation of
manners, that has, perhaps, been increasing here, as well as else-
where, for these 30 years past, with the near neighbourhood
of a much frequented seaport town, may lead the young peo-
ple to assemble oftener together, and lengthen out their meet-
ings to a later hour, than they were accustomed to do, 40 or 50
years ago.  But these indulgences do not seem to be attended
with any very bad consequences.  The people on the whole,
are not remarkable for any thing vicious.  Many of them are
lively, shrewd, and fit for carrying on the common business of
the country, and gradually emancipating themselves from all
the bad effects attendant on the feudal administration.
