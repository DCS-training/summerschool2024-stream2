dustry in manufacturing a peculiar fabric of shoes, which they
still carry on to a great extent, it being well adapted to the
uses of the country people, particularly in the braes of Angus.
-About the year 1745 or 1746 the manufactory of Osnaburgh 
was introduced here, which form very small beginnings has 
grown into a great trade, and has become the staple of the
place; and the happy influence of which,  particularly of late
year, is visible in the amazing increase of population and
wealth, and the consequent improvement of everything.-This
branch of manufacture was brought to Forfar by a gentleman
still living there, who has acquired by it a comfortable inde-

was established to promote the business, and from whence the
discovery was brought to Forfar at the period above mention-

nor were there above 60 looms employed in the town.  But

increased so rapidly, that, before the year 1750, there were up-

between 400 and 500.
