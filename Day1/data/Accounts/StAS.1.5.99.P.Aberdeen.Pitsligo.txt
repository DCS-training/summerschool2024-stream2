of a larger size, and to the advanced price of provisions in
general. The worst season for fishing is from January to 
March, little else being then caught but small cod.  But in
summer, besides cod, both skate ang ling are taken in great
abundance.  In July and August, the greatest attention is
paid to fishing for sea dogs, which are chisfly valuable for
their oil.  The value of losters has increased greatly of
late.  They are caught in numbers, and are sold at 2 d. or
2 1/2 d. a piece for the London market.  The fishermen salt up in
casks the haddocks and cod taken during the winter, and in
April, or, as soon as the season will permit, take them out
and dry them.  These, with what fish are caught and dried
during the summer, they carry about in large boats, and
dispose of among the different towns on the Frith of Forth,
and bring home cargoes of coals and salt.  It is said, that they
get even lower prices for their fish in the fourth country, than
at home; but to this the fishermen reply, that as they can-
not dispose of the whole at home,  it is of little advantage to
sell a part; that they wish to make up a cargo, and receive
a sum of money at once.  Thus the price of the article is
kept up in this part of the country.
