   Cows and Dairy.-The cows most esteemed here, are those
of a small mouth, head and neck long and small.  With
respect to colour, those spotted brown and white are prefer-

daily, when well fed.  Milch cows are supposed to produce
from 5 L. to 8 L. yearly.  Sweet milk sells at 2 d. per Scots
pint; skimmed milk at 1 penny; butter milk at 1/2 d.  When
near a market, they generally make the whole milk into but-

When distant, they make sweet milk cheese or skimmed

markets are distant, grazing for the butcher is esteemed more

were better to top-dress for the pasture, and sow it down
with grass.  I suppose, the reason why they don't sow grass,
is, that the stones hinder them from cutting the hay.  But,
were they to sow down their fields with grass in a very rich
