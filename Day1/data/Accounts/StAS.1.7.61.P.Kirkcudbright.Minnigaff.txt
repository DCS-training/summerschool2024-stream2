   Miscellaneous Observations.-It has been already observed,
that the great road from London to Dublin passes through
this parish for several miles.  The advantages of this are too
obvious to need any remarks.  We have also several other
roads of great utility.  One directly to Edinburgh intersects
this parish for 12 miles.  Another, which is now making
to Ayr, also passes through it for several miles.  This road is
the effect of the patriotism and public spirit of the gentlemen
of Galloway and of Ayrshire, as the whole expence is to be
defrayed by their subscriptions.  The utility of the object
will well reward them for whatever it may cost.  There was
formerly no carriage road to Ayr without going round almost
40 miles.  The great advantage of having a communication
opened with so rich a country as Ayrshire will soon be ex-
perienced.
   This parish produces neither lime nor coals.  Lime, how-
ever, is got from England.  It costs, at the shore, 13 d. per
Carlisle bushel.  The farmers generally lay on 50 bushels to
the acre, but it is by far too little.  Shells, which are found
on the neighbouring shores, are also successfully, used as a
manure.  They are brought in small vessels for some miles
up the Cree; and, when landed, the best kind cost 1 s. 4 d.
per ton. 25 ton are commonly given to the acre.  The same
error is committed here as in the lime.
   The coals, as well as the lime, are brought from England.
They might be procured on very reasonable terms, were it
not for the duty they pay as on exportation, though they are
only carried across a frith, from the English to the Scottish
border.  This duty renders them very high, priced, and re-
presses the spirit of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce,
in every part of Galloway.
