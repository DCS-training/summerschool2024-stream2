merks Scotch yearly, for the benefit of the schoolmaster,
was to have the hereditary right of presenting the school-
master, but the right of trial and admission was to be vested
in the minister and session.  In this state the matter still con-
tinues.  Besides the parish school, there are several private
schools, one supported  by subscription, at which about 50
young persons attend throughout the year; and 3 taught by
women, at which there may be about 50 or 60 scholars.

   Poor.-The funds, for the support of the poor, arise from
collections at the church-door; money for the mortcloths at
burials; dues on marriages; the rent of 3 acres of land; the
interest of L. 80 Sterling lent out on bond, and the rents of
some seats in the church.  The whole amounts to about
L. 46 Sterling yearly.  The number of poor, at an average,
is about 20, who are relieved at their own houses, as their
situations may require, according to the discretion of the
session.  Occasional donations are made by some of the he-
ritors, of whom but few reside in the parish.  In the year
1782, the heritors assessed themselves in the sum of L. 25
Sterling; which, with the ordinary funds, proved sufficient
for the relief of the poor, during the scarcity occasioned by
the failure of that crop.

   Rent, etc.-The valued rent of the parish is L. 8248, 1 s.
11 d. Scotch.-The teind, according to a valuation made in
