     of Montrose.

   Rivers.-To this parish belong two very considerable rivers.
The one, the Northesk, separates the shire of Angus from that
of Kincardine or the Mearns, and runs through the north-
ern extremity of the parish, into the German Ocean.  The
post-road from Montrose to Aberdeen, crossing this river
near its mouth, and the ford, often varying, it frequently
proved fatal to travellers; the inhabitants of Montrose, ex-
cited by the activity of Alexander Christie, Esq; provost at
that time, and aided by a generous public, together with a
liberal donation from the annexed estates, built, in 1775, a
handsome bridge, consisting of seven arches, across this ford.
This bridge is of great advantage to the neighbouring
country, and opens, upon the eastern coast, an easy commu-
nication with the northern part of this kingdom.  The river
sometimes swells to a great height; and, as its banks are low,
the adjacent fields in this parish, suffer, on such occassions, con-
siderable damage.  The proprietors, however, cannot com-
plain, for it fertilizes their lands, and the salmon fishing on
both sides renders their estates much more valuable, than they
would otherwise be.  The Southest separates this parish
from theat of Craig.  After many beautiful meanders, gli-
ding through the bason, and passing by the harbour of
Montrose, this river falls into the German Ocean, about a
mile from the town. 
   Over this river it is proposed to make a bridge, first from
the Fort hill to the island of Inchbrayock, and then a small
one, from Inchbrayock to the lands of Craig.  Estimates
have already been given in, of one bridge with the piers of
stone, and the rest of wood, of another entirely of wood, and
of a third intirely of stone.  Subscriptions, to a considerable
amount, have been obtained, and an act of parliament ha-
ving also passed last session for the purpose, this great work
will probably soon be accomplished.  It is certainly a great
