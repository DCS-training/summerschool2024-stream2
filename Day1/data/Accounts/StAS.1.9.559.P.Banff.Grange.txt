part of the burials comes from other parishes and many
persons dying in this parish are buried elsewhere; so that
from the most attentive observation, for 4 years that the re-
gister was kept, it appeared that the burials did not corre-
spond at all with the deaths; for these reasons the register
was given up.  The register of marriages is rather a register
of the contract and publication of banns of every individual
in the parish that is contracted, whether they marry or set-
tle in the parish or not; but those females that are contract-
ed to men in other parishes, though their contract be re-
corded here, do not add to the number of married couples
in the parish, for they generally remove from it altogether.
This will account, in some measure, for the great dispropor-
tion that sometimes appears between the marriages and
baptisms in the table; and it is likewise to be observed,
that the dissenters register all their contracts, but few or
none their baptisms.  The baptism-register appears to
have been accurately kept, except during the period from
1771 to 1780, during which the church was vacant 2 1/2 years,
and the people were frequently obliged to go to neighbour-
ing clergymen to get their children baptized; and not ha-
ving an immediate opportunity of recording their childrens
names, many of them did entirely neglect it.  If, therefore,
the register had been regularly kept during that period,
the average number of baptisms, would probably have been
about 36, instead of 28 9/10; certainly it would have been
greater than it is.  At any rate, the writer of this is sure,
that the names of all the children of the members of the
Establishment are regularly recorded from the year 1780;
and though the Seceders, and other dissenters, do not regi-
ster the names of their children, there is every reason to be-
lieve, that their numbers are not so great now, as that of
the Papists and Episcopals were at the beginning of this
century, when the first Presbyterian minister was settled
