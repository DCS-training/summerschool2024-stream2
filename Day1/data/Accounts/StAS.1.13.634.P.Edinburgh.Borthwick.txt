the sunk storey, they are from the adjacent area to the
battlement 90 feet high; and if we include the roof, which

impregnable, so that all who were under their protection
might be perfectly secure.  The castle is surrounded on
every side but one by steep ground and water, and at e-

racteristic of the author, shall here be transcribed verbatim.  It was writ-
