like many others in Scotland, during the prevalence of the feu-

pendants, lived in a state of almost constant hostility with
each other.
   The parish is situated in what is called the Carse braes, a-
bout midway between Perth and Dundee; extends about 2
miles E. and W. and 3 S. and N. comprehending the waste
and uninhabited hilly lands.

   Soil and Climate.-The smallest, but richest part of the pa-
rish, lies in the Carse of Gowrie; well known for the strength
and fertility of its soil.  On the south side of the Carse braes,
the soil is a mixture, in different proportions, of black earth,
and what is called mortar, perhaps from its cementing quality,
which makes it fit to be used in building.  It is not so rich
and strong as the Carse clay or black earth, but produces crops
of all the different grain sold in the Carse; though not so lux-
uriant, yet of such good quality, that the farmers can dispose
of them at nearly the same price.  The north side of the braes,
not only the climate, but the soil, light and shallow, render
less fit for cultivation.  It is mostly bent and heath, intermix-
ed, however, with fields of good natural pasture; which,
divided at a small rent, among tenants who have farms
on the south side, enables them to rear a greater number of
cattle than they could otherwise have done, the yearly sale of
which assists them to pay the higher rents at which they have
their corn farms.
   The air of the Carse and Carse hills is rather moist; from
which, it might be thought, unhealthy, and that rheuma-
tisms, agues, and consumptions, would be the prevailing dif-
tempers.  They are, however, by no means so prevalent as for-
merly; owing no doubt, in a great measure, to the progress
of improvement by draining, which continues to be carried
