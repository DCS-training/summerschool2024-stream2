manner, are commonly found to have two, and sometimes
three lambs in their bellies.
   Goats have never been common here, though one would
imagine from the hills, and rugged rocks bold and steep,
with which Orkney in several places abounds, they might
have been of benefit to the proprietors.-Swine there are in
vast numbers; and as they go generally at large, even in sum-
mer, they are uncommonly destructive to the corn and grass
ground, and particularly to the potatoes.  The kind that is
here is remarkably small, and very ugly, the back being very
high, and the bristles long and coarse, and the colour which
they commonly have a dirty white; the pork of them when
pickled for some time makes excellent eating, and sells for
2 d. per pound, and the whole carcase of a middle sized one
may be purchased for 5 s.-There are rabbits in great plenty,
but no hares; nor did ever wolves or foxes disturb the
flocks, or if they did the species has long since perished.-
Six different kinds of dogs are here, the shepherds dog, the
greyhound, the pointer, the water dog, the mastiff, the lap
dog, and the terrier.-The black Muscovy water rat, which
is the only one now to be met with, has destroyed the grey
or brown sort, and has proved as destructive as it is prolific.
There are plenty of seaIs and otters.

   Birds.-The domesticated fowls are common here, the
cock and hen, the tame geese and tame ducks, turkeys, and
pea-fowls.  The wild fowl of these islands are very numerous.
Among these we may reckon eagles of various sorts; wild
geese and ducks in no small variety, herons, hawks of different
sizes, gulls of many kinds, the ember goose, the dunter or
cider duck, the fly goose, the awk, the lyre, and the tyste,
the pickternie, the norie, and culterneb, the calaw, the scarf,
and the seapie or the chaldrick.  To this list must be added
