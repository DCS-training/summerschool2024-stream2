Number of persons between 80 and 90 years,                         14
                          90 and 100 years,                         1
Average number of children to a family 3, and about 1/3
There is 1 person blind, and 1 fatuous.

   Illegitimate births in the course of the last three years, 8.
   From the great hrregularity in registering baptisms, it is not easy
to say with precision what the exact number of births may be; but
we think they may be safely reckoned at from 34 to 37 in the year,
   The average number of marriages for seven years, is 10 or 11;
and of deaths for the same period, 26.  In that period, 29 indivi-
duals bad attained the age of eighty and upwards, at the time of
their death.  One individual, the late Sir Robert Preston, was
ninety-four.
Number of unmarried men, bachelors, and widowers upwards of 50 years of age, 33
                    women and widows upwards of 45,                          50
The calculation for the above statement was made in the year
1835, and the population, as rated in the Government census of
1831, is a little more. The difference amounting to 34 may be
accounted for, by the circumstance that, in the latter year, a num-
ber of workmen were employed about the repair of the abbey,
many of whom were strangers, but fell to be rated in the return to
Government.
   When manufactures are depressed, they who are engaged in
them experience, of course, an abridgement of their comfort; but,
such seasons excepted, the inhabitants are perbaps as well off as
any in similar situations through the country, and they are, general-
ly speaking, contented and industrious.  Many even of the hum-
blest show `n inclination for reading.
   The number of persons of all ages employed in weaving is about
70, who are connected either with the Dunfermline linen manu-
factures, or in working cotton cloths for the Glasgow trade.
