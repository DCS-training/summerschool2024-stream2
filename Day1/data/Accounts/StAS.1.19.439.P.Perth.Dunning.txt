     of Dunning.

landed proprietors in this parish do not commonly attend
on divine service in the parochial church; so that the
poor here, as in most other places of Scotland, are supported
by the commonality.-Two friendly societies, or boxes, as
they are usually called, are established in the parish, and
from which the members belonging to them who fall into
want, receive a ready supply.  One belongs to the weavers,
and the other to the masons, in the parish and neighbour-

mediate neighbourhood of Dunning is the village of New
Pitcairn, or Dragon's Den, as it is usually called.  It is but
of recent origin; and consists of about thirty tenements or
dwelling-houses, all of which, except a very few, contains
two families, and some of them four.  The ground on
which this village is built is feued from Mr Graham of
Orchil.  The lots are mostly an hundred ells square, for
which is paid L. 1 Sterling of purchase-money, and 7 d.
a-year of feu-duty.  The houses here are neat and clean,
and are mostly constructed for weavers.  They are built for
a guinea per rood, (mason's measure), with service, or 20 s.
without service.  Freestone is got every where at hand; not
