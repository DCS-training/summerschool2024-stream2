subservient to nature, and theory to practice.  This method
is not new, though of late, too much neglected; for the
same principle has been the guide of all great practical phy-
sicians, both of ancient and modern times.  And it is by
this method only that the art of physic can be improved
and brought to perfection.  It is not to be improved by hy-
potheses and ingenious theories formed in the closet, but by
observations accurately made in the chambers of the sick.
   The annexed tables are extracted from the records of the
Dispensary, which contain every patient's name, date of
admission, age, residence, disease, cure, or death, with the
names of the recommenders; and all the recommendations
are numbered, preserved, and presented, along with the
books, to a general meeting of the subscribers for examina-
tion, by whose orders the returns are annually printed,
and dispersed among the citizens of Aberdeen.  The re-
turns of 1794 afford a melancholy proof of the power of
prejudice, for in that year 35, or more than half of the
deaths were of the natural small-pox, notwithstanding Dr
Gordon had given public notice of his readiness to inocu-
late gratis the children of the poor.
