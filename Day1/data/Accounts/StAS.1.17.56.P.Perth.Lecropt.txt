in winter.  The statute labour is not commuted.

   Ecclesiastical state.-The church and manse are beautifully
situated on the face of the rising ground, above the Carse,
and command a rich and extensive prospect, already taken

Gothic building*, consisting of a nave and choir, 72 feet in
length; the nave being only 14 feet broad, and the choir but
11.  The steps to the altar are still visible; and the sacred
font is quite entire.  The manse is commodious, and in good
repair.  The glebe consists of 7 acres of fertile land, properly
inclosed.  The stipend is 48 L. 19 s. 2 1/2 d. in money, 43 bolls
of meal, and 23 bolls of barley.  Mr STIRLING of Kier is

which practice it seems, from similar institutions, was not un-
common in these times.
