                        PARISH OF HUMBIE.

           PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND
                           TWEEDDALE.

           THE REV.  JAMES MACFARLANE, MINISTER.


        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THIS parish was formed soon after the Reformation
by the junction of the parishes of Keith and Humbie. In the end
of the seventeenth century, the parish of Keith was called Keith-
Symmars; and that of Humbie, Keith-Hundeley. The origin of
the name Humbie, which they bear since their annexation, is un-
known.
   Extent, Boundaries.-This parish is partly intersected, towards
the S. W. extremity, by the parish of Fala. But supposing it con-
tinuous, it is an oblong of 6 mhles in length, from north to south,
and 5 in breadth,-containing 19,200 imperial acres. It is bound-
ed on the east by the parishes of Bolton and Salton; on the north
by Pencaitland; on the N. W. by Ormiston and Cranston; on
the west and south-west by Crichton and Fala; and on the south by
the range of the Lammermoor-hills.
   Topographical Appearances.-These hills vary in their form,
soil, and elevation. Some of them are almost entirely covered with
short heath; others are green, but interspersed with mossy bogs,-
some of which have been lately dried by open surface draining,
to improve the sheep pasture. Lammerlaw, which is the highest
peak of the whole ridge, may, reckoned 1200 feet above the le-
vel of the sea. In other parts, the height of the summit above the
level of the sea is from 800 to 1000 feet. The lower end of the
parish is 350 feet above the sea level, and the base of the Lammer-
moors 600,-thus producing an elevation of 250 feet across the
arable ground of the parish. In the higher parts of the parish the
air is sharp and cold; but in the lower, it is more temperate. The
climate is peculiarly healthful. In the centre and northern parts
of the parish, less rain falls than at Edinburgh,-the pluvial clouds
