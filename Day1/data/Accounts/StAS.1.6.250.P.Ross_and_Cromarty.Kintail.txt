in Kintail: this defect, however, is nearly remedied by a ba-
ron baillie, who visits the place quarterly to settle all differen-
ces.  Very great discouragements are given to law-suits of e-
very description: the baillie in general is the sole arbiter.  The
recovery of small debts, encroachments on marshes, and tres-

   Schools, Ecclesiastical State, and Poor.-There is a parochial
school at Croe-side, with a salary of 200 merks; and another
school at Glenelchaig, supported by subscription from the te-
nants, many of whom are Roman Catholics.
   The heritors of the parish are only two, Francis Humber-
stone M'Kenzie of Seaforth, and Alexander Chisholm of Chif-

is L. 800 sterling.  The stipend amounts to L. 55: 11: 1 1/3
sterling; with L. 3: 6: 8 for communion elements, besides a
glebe.  There has been no augmentation of stipend within the
present century.-A catechist was established at Glenelchaig,
with a salary of L. 15, which is now reduced to L. 5.  The
priest lives in the town of Dornie, where he has built a dwel-
ling; but he has no meeting-house.-The church is called
Kiel-Duich.  There are no traditional accounts of the original
building.  In 1719, it was burnt by the same ship of war
which demolished the castle of Donan; but it is at present in
excellent repair.  All the people from the parish of Glensheal
bury in this church yard; though it is evident, from the names
of several towns in that parish, they had once burial places a-

   The poor's roll contains 15 persons: and such of these as
are disabled by age or sickness are supported by the inhabitants,
who send them supplies by the hands of some of their friends.
The Sunday collections must be very inconsiderable, as only
