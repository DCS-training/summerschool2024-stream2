   Ecclesiastical State and Schools.-The Duke of Argyll is pa-
tron of the parish, and has a small property in it.  The
amount of the teinds is 178 bolls victual, and 308 L. 14 s. 8 d.
Scotch; out of which the minister, though the stipend was
lately augmented by the Teind, Court, gets only 63 L. Ster-
ling, and 2 chalders of victual, Linlithgow measure; a sti-
pend perfectly inadequate to the circumstances of the parish,
which is large, populous, discontiguous, and a place of great
resort, and far below what, in the present circumstances of
the country, the rank and situation of the clergy would re-
quire.  There is no manse.  The minister receives, in lieu
thereof, 12 L. 10 s. annually from the heritors.  He rents a
farm and farm-house.  Farms are absolutely necessary to the
clergy in the country, a legal glebe being too poor a substi-
tute for the want of regular markets.  There are 4 1/2 acres
arable land for a glebe, and a servitude on a neighbouring
farm of 4 cows grass.  The servitude was originally on the
whole of the farm; but, from the inability of the Scotch
clergy to cope with superior power, the farm has been sub-
divided, and the minister's cows turned over to a bleak moor,
where the cattle, even in summer, are starving.
   There are two parochial places of worship, one in the Kil-
calmonell, and one in the Kilberry division.  They are dis-
tant from each other 5 miles, including a mile of tea, being
the breadth of Loch Tarbert.  There is a church built only
at one of them, which is too small for the people, who are
obliged to pay a heavy tax, in name of seat rent, to the heri-
tors, for permission to attend it.  This last observation like-
wise applies to a chapel at Tarbert, where divine service is
