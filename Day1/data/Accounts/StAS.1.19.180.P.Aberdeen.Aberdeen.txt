     Statistical Account

1790-95, amounted to 24,493, making, an increase, if Dr
Webster's account is to be relied on, of no less than 9060.
   The people in general are industrious and sober; and not
few arrive at an advanced period of life.  Several wo-
men died lately above 90 years of age, and one above
100*.

   Remarks.-The above state comprehends the three pastoral charges into
which the town of Aberdeen is divided.  These, together with the village
of Futtie, which (being under the charge of a distinct catechist, who has
hitherto been ordained, but not reckoned a minister of Aberdeen) is not
included in this state, make up the parish of St Nicholas.  It comprehends
none of the extensive suburbs west and south from the Denburn, they ha-
ving belonged to the deanry of Aberdeen, and now to the parish of St Ma-
char, commonly called Old Machar, or Old Aberdeen.  In these there has
been a very great increase of inhabitants within the last forty years.
   The above state takes in, not the number of souls, but only of exami-
nable persons, as the ministers included not children in their lists.  They
reckoned them examinable as soon as they had learned to read, and could
answer some of the common questions; so that their lists contained
at least all persons of five years old and upwards.  In calculating from
these the number of souls, it is to be observed, that in Aberdeen (and
perhaps in most towns) the number of children bears a less proportion to
