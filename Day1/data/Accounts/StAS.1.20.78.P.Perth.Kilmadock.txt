   Black-Cattle.-Owing to the want of inclosures, the black-
cattle of this parish make but a poor figure at the Doune
markets.  The whole cattle, including young and old, kept
on the parish are about 2243.  Now, the whole area of the
parish being reckoneed 64 square miles, or 40,960 acres, and
supposing one-tenth to be heath and moss producing no
grass, and another tenth to be occupied by roads, houses, fen-
ces, and strips of planting, there remains 32,768 acres; one-
third whereof (10,922) will be commonly in tillage, and
the other two-thirds (21,845) remain for grass.  This grass
would be of various quality; the best might admit 1 cow
on each acre, but other places might require 2, and perhaps
3 acres to each cow.  However, counting old and young
beasts, 2 acres may be allowed on the average to each beast
during summer, whereby no less than 10,922 cattle might
be supported, were the grounds inclosed and subdivided,
and properly laid out.
   Of the cattle presently on the parish, one half are milch
cows, the other half are young cattle.  Now, valuing each
cow's grass at 20 s. and 10 s. for the feeding of each young
beast, we can draw the following comparative state:
