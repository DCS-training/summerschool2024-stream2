put by the presbytery, first to the elders respecting the walk, con-
versation, and doctrine of the minister; then to the congregation
respecting the elders and deacons; then respecting the school-
master, session-clerk, precentor, and beadle; and, last of all to the
session respecting the congregation. It is impossible to conceive
a system more fitted to promote the diligence and faithfulness of
ministers, or the spiritual and moral improvement of parishes. Its
effects, accordingly, were visible in a diminution of crime, and an
increase of personal and family religion among the surrounding
districts.
   The next part of the records, from 11th February 1733 to 7th
July 1747, has been lost,-through a mistake, it is said, on the
part of an ignorant individual who destroyed both these and the
more ancient minutes.  The rest have been preserved.
   The session has at present a copy of the acts of Assembly, and
of the formula contained in the 10th act of Assembly 1694, which
has been subscribed by the elders. The late Mr Gavin present-
ed them with a pair of silver communion cups; his daughter, Miss
Elizabeth Gavin, with a silver baptismal basin; and Lady Eliza-
beth Pringle, daughter of the late Marquis of Breadalbane, pre-
sented them in 1827. with a handsome pulpit Bible and psalm-
book. The church, which is at present in excellent repair, con-
tains 250 sittings, all of which are free.
   The glebe consists of 10 acres.  The stipend consists of L. 122,
5s. 4 7/12d., and of 67 bolls, 2 bushels, 2 pecks, 3 quarts, 0.103 of oats,
and 38 bolls, 3 bushels, 1 peck, 2 quarts, 1 pint, 972 of barley paid
by the Marchioness of Breadalbane; and of 3 bushels, 2 pecks, 1
gallon, 2 quarts, 1 pint, 179 of oats, and 2 bushels, 3 quarts,
1.6.255 of barley paid by Mr Hay of Dunse Castle. The teinds
are supposed to be nearly exhausted.
   The Dissenters attend the different chapels in Dunse. Their
number throughout the parish is about a third of the population.
In the village of Gavinton, containing (September 1833) a popu-
lation of 243, there were of Churchmen, 182; of the Relief, 33;
Burgher and Antiburgher, 28.
   It must be observed, however, that among the farm-servants,-
a population much less stationary than the inhabitants of villages,
-the proportion of Dissenters is greater. The number of com-
municants in the Established Church averages from 210 to 232.
   Education.-The parochial schoolmaster has, for the last seven
years, been unfit for duty, and has resigned the management of the
school, retaining the salary, which amounts to L. 25, 4s. 4d., with
his dwelling-house and garden. An assistant and successor has
