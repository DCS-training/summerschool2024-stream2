mixture of barley, rye, and pease.  On Sundays, they
have generally barley broth, with some meat in winter,
and butter in summer.  In places near the sea-coast,
they have sometimes fish.  Turnips are sometimes used
in place of cabbage or greens; and potatoes dressed in
different ways, with butter, milk, onions, &c., is com-
monly one-third part of their food from the beginning of
September to the end of March.  This is the general run
of diet of the labouring people in this part of the coun-
try, that is, of lesser farmers, farmers servants, and
people of that class; and all the above they have in suf-
ficient plenty.  The oat meal, which forms so consider-
able an article in the above, is of the very best quality
throughout all Murray; and, notwithstanding the ob-
jections made against the use of oat meal by some, it
is known to those who are best qualified to judge, to be,
when properly dressed, one of the most wholesome and
nourishing articles of food.  The cottagers and poorer sort
of the people have not always what is called kitchen,
that is, milk or beer, to their meals.  In the view of
patriotism and humanity, it is a pity that the article of
beer cannot be rendered more attainable by the poorer
sort of people.  This might be effected, at least in some
measure, by lowering the duty on malt, and imposing it
on spirits; and this would have the double happy effect
of affording to the poor a comfortable and strengthening
beverage, and checking the use of that which is noxi-
ous.  Such a measure deserves the attention of those
who are able to carry it into effect.
   The better sort here, as elsewhere throughout the N.,
use cloth from England or the southern parts of Scot-
land; and many of the farmers, and tradesmen, and some
even of the servants, use the same on Sundays, and on
