that name, a large and well built pile, stands on the upper
border of the great valley, lying west of the conflux of
the two rivers.  The modern part, which is by far the most
considerable, was built about the end of the last century;
but part of the house is of longer standing, bearing date

built in the middle of the town, which formerly stood clus-

*The following tradition is handed down with respect to the
first building of this bridge.  Some controverted point was to be
settled by a plurality of voices, at a meeting of the clergy, to be
held at Hamilton, upon a certain day.  A priest who lived south-

his neighbourhood, to join him in supporting it.  But on the day
fixed, when they came to the side of the river, it was swoln with
the rains beyond the possibility of passing, and the opposite par-
ty carried the point; at which, the priest was so much provoked,
that, being very rich, he immediately ordered a bridge to the built
at his own expence, that such a disappointment might not occur in
future.
