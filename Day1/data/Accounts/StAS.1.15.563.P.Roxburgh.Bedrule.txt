     of Bedrule.

   Newton-Was anciently the property of a family of the
surname of Ker, who appear to have been cadets of Ferni-
hirst.  There was also a house of strength there, now like-
wise demolished: but the beautiful avenues of venerable
trees still remaining, bespeak to the passing traveller some-
thing of the consequence and taste of its former inhabi-
tants.

   Rewcastle-Situated upon a more elevated ground, than ei-
ther Bedrule or Newton, is considered by some as a place of
great antiquity.  Indeed, it is said, however unlikely from
its present appearance, that the Courts of Justice were ori-
ginally held there, and afterwards removed to Jedburgh.  The
origin of the name, and whether it has been derived from
proprietors of the surname of Rewcastle, or whether it may
have given the surname to that family, is uncertain.  Be
that as it may, both surname and place are certainly of con-
siderable antiquity.

   Fulton-Has now scarcely any vestiges of its ancient conse-
quence, except some remains of its tower, which are still
standing, and sometimes used by the tenant as a bught for
his sheep.  The well known surname Fulton, corresponds
to the name of this place; but we do not adventure to con-
jecture, whether there have been any connection between
the one and the other; for we have been able, as yet, to
trace less of its history, even by tradition, than any of the
former.

   Encampments.-There are plain vestiges of a regular en-
campment, on an elevated ground, almost at an equal dis-
tance between Bedrule and Newton.  From its figure,
which is still distinct it appears to have been British.  There
