rally thrown down.  In some parts of the district, stones are
not to be got in sufficient quantities for inclosing; and, even
where they can be got, a tenant can hardly be expected to in-
close on a lease of 19 years, the longest generally granted
here.
   The shortness of leases usually given, seems to present an
insuperable bar to perfection in agriculture.  From the de-
creasing value of money, the landlord imagines he must be
a loser by granting a long lease.  But might not a lease be
granted for 3, 4, or 5 nineteen years, without any material in-
jury to the landlord, arising from the progressive decrease of the
value of money?  For instance, might not the rent of a farm be
regulated by the price of oatmeal, or of any kind of grain?
Suppose a farm to be let for 20 L., and the price of oatmeal,
at the beginning of the lease, to be 10 s. per boll, then the
rent, or 20 L., would be equivalent to 40 bolls of oatmeal.
Suppose, at the end of the first 19 years, the price of oatmeal,
on an average of 7 years, to be 12 s. per boll, then let the
rent for the second 19 years be the price of 40 bolls of meal,
at 12 s. per boll, or 24 L. Suppose, at the end of the second
19 years, oatmeal to be 14 s per boll, then let the rent, for the
third 19 years, be the price of 40 bolls of meal, at 14 s. per
boll, or 28 L.  The rising rent might in the fame manner be
regulated by the price of cattle or sheep of a certain weight,
or of beef or wool, or other productions of the farm.  A
moderate advance might likewise be made for the capability
of improvement.  A long lease might surely be granted, upon
this or a similar plan, without materially injuring the land-
lord; while the tenant would be encouraged to attempt sub-
stantial improvements, as he would have a certain prospect of
reaping the fruits of his industry.
