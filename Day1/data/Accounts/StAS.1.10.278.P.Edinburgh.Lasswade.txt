tions of the earth.  In this particular, the higher districts are
improving every year by the influence of large and thriving
plantations.

   Agriculture.-There are 50 ploughs in the parish, mostly
of Small's construction, and drawn by 2 horses, but some far-
mers still prefer the Scotch plough.  The following is the
rotation of crops most frequently observed.  Wheat is sown
after potatoes, or summer fallow; when the wheat is after po-
tatoes, and on light sand, it is sown down with grass seeds;
when after summer fallow, it is succeeded by a crop of pease
or beans, then oats or barley with grass seeds; after lying a
year or two in grass, the land is broken up and sown with
oats.  About a sixth part of the arable ground in the parish
is kept in pasture, for which graziers pay a high rent.
   Gardening is carried on here to a considerable extent; and
the attention of the gardener is chiefly directed to the culti-
vation of strawberries, than which he has not a surer or
more profitable crop.  They depend less upon the season than
other fruits; they never, indeed, fail altogether, which in this
country is often the case with the other productions of the
garden; and, when properly cultivated, this fruit will yield at
an average 18 L. from an acre.  It may be observed, that it
was in this parish that strawberries were first raised in any
quantities for the public market.
   The farmers, in general, breed their own horses, which are
of a large size, and valued at from 18 L. to 25 L. They breed
also their own cows, mostly of the common Scotch kind, and
which will sell for from 5 L. to 10 L.  Many gentlemen have
cows of the English, Dutch, and Guernsey breed.

   Markets, Rent, etc.-There is a butcher market in the pa-
rish, where prices are nearly the same as in Edinburgh;
