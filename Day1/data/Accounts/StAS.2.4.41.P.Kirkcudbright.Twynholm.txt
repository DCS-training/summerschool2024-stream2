         The population in 1755, was       519
                           1763,           510
                           1791,           611
                           1794,           620

        whom there were males, 378, and females, 419.

	The partial decrease that has taken place since the census of
1831, is to be principally attributed to the circumstance, that, in
1831, extensive improvements were carried on, on the estate of
Barwhinnock, and as these are now completed the labourers who
were engaged in them have removed with their families.
	About 250 of the above-mentioned inhabitants reside in the vil-
age of Twynholm, the rest in the country.
