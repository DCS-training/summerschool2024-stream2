who could effect either of there objects, won the game.  But,
if neither party won, the ball was cut into two equal parts at
sun-set.  In the coursed of the play one might always fee some
scene of violence between the parties; but, as the proverb of
this part of the country expresses it, all was fair at the ball of
Scone.
   This custom is supposed to have had its origin in the days of
chivalry.  An Italian, it is said, came into this part of the
country, challenging all the parishes, under a certain penalty
in case of declining his challenge.  All the parishes declined
the challenge excepting Scone, which beat the foreigner; and
in commemoration of this gallant action the game was in-
stituted.
   Whilst the custom continued, every man in the parish, the
gentry not excepted, was obliged to turn out and support the
side to which he belonged; and the person who neglected to
do his part on that occasion was fined; but the custom being
attended with certain inconveniencies, was abolished a few
years ago.
