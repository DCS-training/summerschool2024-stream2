here.  The inhabitants in general are economical, and
augment, rather than diminish their stock.  They are well
clothed and fed.  Superior industry affords them a plenti-
ful supply of the necessaries and comforts of life.  Among
one class, however, economy does not seem to have been
much regarded.-The whole landed property has been
transferred by sale since the year 1743.  Prices of land
have been, I presume, about 25 years purchase, or perhaps
a little more.-We have few calls for extraordinary exer-
tions of humanity: in clamant cases of distress, I can easi-
ly believe our people capable of extraordinary beneficence.
They enjoy, in a considerable degree, the advantages and
comforts of society: contented with their accommodation,
few remove to distant parts of the country, or emigrate to
foreign countries.-The circumstances most extensively
distressing, are those which affect the manufacturers of
green linen.  They depend on two countries, Russia for
their raw materials, and the West Indies and part of A-
merica for the sale of their manufacture.  A bad crop of
flax in Russia, or the jobbing spirit of the merchants there,
or extraordinary profits to the importers of the flax, often
reduce the profits of these manufacturers to a mere trifle.
This evil, I think, might be removed, if flax raising could
be brought to a system, which would render a flax crop
equally certain with any other crop.  Our soil is pretty
much adapted to the raising of flax, and the plan of farm-
ing here is such, that the farmer could easily employ a
few acres in cultivating it.  In this case, there would be
only the chance of the sale market against the manufactu-
rers.  But although grievances were redressed as much as
possible, it is still a question, whether that is not the most
desirable manufacture which is supplied with materials
from the country itself, and has the benefit of a home
market, founded on the natural demand of the inhabitants
