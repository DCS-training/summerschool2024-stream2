     Statistical Account

manure, and seed: the one ridge is rather lower and flatter
than the other.  In this ridges there is not one plant of an
hundred sound.  In the other ridge, the 4 rows lying nearest
the furrow on each side of the ridge, are curle-tops, with very
few exceptions; the 4 rows on the highest part of the ridge,
are healthy vigorous plants.  I know no way of accounting
for this, but by saying that the excess of moisture has produ-
ced it.
   There were in this district in 1792, more than 1559
cattle young and old, male and female.  There were
420 horses of the above description, and of sheep, 1940.
The tenants breed their own cows, and most of them their
working horses.  There are in this parish 7 threshing milns,
and their number will soon be increased.  One of these is set
and kept in motion by water, a very considerable saving to the
tenant; and the machine, one would think, must move more
steadily, and with greater effect, than those worked with hor-
ses.  Some indeed have made use of oxen and horses; but
these animals have so different a movement, that the practice
has not become general.  It is to be hoped, that oxen will be
trained for this useful instrument of husbandry; and there can
be little doubt, that in some situations and circumstances, it
might be worked by the force of wind.  There are 4 meal
milns in the district; one lint and barley mill, moved by one
water wheel; and one belonging to a dyer for the purposes of
his employment.
   There are 3 bridges in the parish, all of them over the
Multree burn; one of them giving passage to travellers from
Cupar to the north, and the other to travellers from the north
to St Andrews: one end of the Guard bridge rests on this
parish; the other on the parish of St Andrews.
   On this end of the bridge is erected the only toll-gate Within
