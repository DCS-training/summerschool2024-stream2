no robbery, murder, or suicide.  In general they are subtile,
and not easily deceived.  They are mannerly, lively, and in-
genious, very hospitable to strangers, and kind to the distres-
sed.  And though it be impossible to answer for the behavi-
our of all the common people, if left at liberty, the shipwreck-
ed have always found protection and safety from the best fa-
milies.
   Tradition tells us of the remarkable stature, strength, and
valour, of John the Great, the laird of Coll's predecessor.
He, in several battles, conquered the Macneils of Barra, who
pretended right to his lands, and established himself in the
heritage, handed down to him from Macdonald of the Isles.
The Macniels burying-grounds are pointed out to day, in
many places in Coll.  Though Neil his brother was not near
equal in strength, he could raise to his breast three stones, on
top of each other, weighing at least 16 cwt.  The stones re-
main still at the place.
   A country man, who died last year about 5 feet 10 inches
high, was employed by the laird of Coll as post to Glasgow
or Edinburgh.  His ordinary burden thence to Coll was 16
stone.  Being once stopt at a toll near Dumbarton, he hu-
morously asked whether he should pay for a burden, and up-
on being answered in the negative, carried his horse in his
arms past the toll.
   Indeed, though of an ordinary size, the people are remark-
able for agility.  They frequently entertain themselves by
composing and singing songs, by repeating Fingalian and
other tales, by dancing assemblies at different farms by turns.
In this qualification they are remarkably neat.  They are ve-
ry chearful and humorous, and there are not above two or
three of either sex corpulent in either isle.
