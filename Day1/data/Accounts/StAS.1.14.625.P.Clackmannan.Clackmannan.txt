match for the Scotch under an equal law.  This mode
was continued till July 1786, when the license act took
place, imposing 30 s. a gallon yearly on the contents of eve-
ry still used for distillation in Scotland; continuing the last
plan with respect to England (where the duty amounted 
to 2 s. 6 d. for the gallon of spirits, and imposing an ad-
ditional duty of 2 s. on the gallon of spirits sent from Scot-
land to England: which additional duty was to be paid in
London, on the arrival of the spirits in the river Thames.
   This act was passed as an experiment, and was to con-
tinue for two years.  Under it, the  London distillers expect-
ed, that the Scotch could not continue the trade to Lon-
don.  This trade, however, still continued to increase;
which increased also the astonishment of the London trad-
ers, who gave in representation to the Treasury upon 
the suject.  In consequence of which, and upwards of
six months previous to the natural expiration of the law,
another law was passed, imposing a duty of 6 d. a gallon
on all Scotch spirits sent to England, in addition to the
former 2 s.; while the duty on spirits manufactured in Eng-
land was allowed to remain at the 2 s. 6 d.  When this act was
passed, the Scotch distilleries stopped payment.  The law
continued in this way till July 1788, when the license duty
in Scotland was doubled, and made 3 l. a gallon, on the
contents of the still; and at the same time laying the
trader under such restrictions, when he worked for Eng-
land, as to amount to a prohibition against his entering
that market.  And in July 1793, the license has been raised
to 9 l. Sterling a gallon yearly.  Previous to the year 1788;
the quantity of corn used annually at the distillery of
Kilbagie alone amounted to above 60,000 bolls, and the
annual quantity of spirits made, to above 3000 tons.  The
black cattle fed annually were about 7000; swine 2000.
