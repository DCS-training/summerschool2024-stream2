The rental in 1752, ascertained before the Court of Session,

Hence, the present rental is five times the rental in 1752.  This
vast rise of land in 1 troquire is in a great measure owing to
the people having abandoned a wretched mode of husban-
dry, in which they laid all their dung upon 3, 4, or 5 acres,
of a field adjoining to the house, which they called crofting
land, upon which they yearly sowed bear or barley, that
yielded the farmers only four or five or one, owing to its be-
ing choaked with weeds.  The rest of the farm had no other
manure but what dropped from the cattle in the field; con-
sequently, their outfield crop, being oats, was very poor, and
could scarcely pay the labour.

   Laying lime upon the land, which began near 40 years ago,
chiefly contributed to the improvements of the land and the
rise of rent.  Some little shell marle and sea mud, which were
only got on some farms, were likewise used.  These means of
improvement introduced a sensible mode of husbandry, and
will account for the great rise of land in Troquire, together
with the increased price of cattle and grain.
