however, have been found in the muscles taken out of this
lake.
   The soil in the bottom of this lake is not deep, but is
seemingly of a marly nature, owing, perhaps, to muscle-
shells decayed.

   Rivers, etc.-No navigable rivers run through the pa-
rish, but a considerable stream, one of the branches of the
Ugie, runs by the north and south-east boundaries.  A ca-
nal could be carried along both branches of the Ugie at no
great expence, and with the most beneficial consequences
to the agriculture and commerce of Buchan.
   This parish has above four miles of coast, and the shore
is flat and sandy.  The species of first caught on this coast
are turbot, holibut, plaice, skate, ling, cod, sand-eel, had-
dock, whiting, cole-fish, flounders, soles, and mackaral.
Sometimes, but rarely, sea-bream, wrasse, and dorce.  Her-
ring also are found, but there are no herring-nets.  One
trial was made of fishing for salmon, and was tolerably
successful.
   Sea-wreck of several kinds is found on the coast; and
kelp is made, but in small quantities.
   There are two fishing-towns belonging to Mr Gordon of
Buthlaw.  One of these was lately built, and consists of 20
tiled houses, placed in two parallel rows, with a street in
the middle.

   Mosses.-There are several extensive mosses in this pa-
rish.  A large one belongs to Mr Milne of Crimond-mo-
gate, another to Mr Cumming of Kinithmont.  The
other heritors, Mr Duff of Logie, son of the late Admiral
Duff, Mr Bisset of Rathon, and Mr Fraser of Park, have
also mosses, which abound in the whole district of Buchan.
