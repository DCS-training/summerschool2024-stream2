			PARISH OF STEVENSTON.

          PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR.

	       REV. DAVID LANDSBOROUGH, MINISTER.

                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

	Name and Boundaries, &c.--The parish of Stevedston derives
its name from Stephen Lockhart, who settled in it in the twelfth
century; his father having about 1170 obtained a grant of the
whole parish from Richard Morville, Lord of Cuninghame and
Constable of Scotland.* Its greatest length is about 5 miles,
from Saltcoats harbour to Irvine Bar; and its greatest breadth is
about 3 miles. It contains about 6 1/4 square miles; or about 3182
Scotch acres. It is bounded on the north by Ardrossan and Kil-
winning; on the south by the Fritli of Clyde; on the west by Ar-
drossan; and on the east by Kilwinning, and by the river Garnock,
which separates it, for about three miles, from the parish of Irvine;
and on the south-east, by the confluence of the Garnock and Irvine,
separating it from that part of the parish of Dundonald, which, by
an act of last General Assembly, has been erected into a new pa-
rish, quoad, spiritualia, called Fullerton.
	Though the surface is varied, it in no place rises to any great
height. From Saltcoats there is a gradual acclivity to Croak's-
well, on the northern boundary, towards Dalry, where there is
the highest ground in the parish, 308 feet above the level of
the sea at high water. At Castle-hill, on the eastern boundary,
there are two eminences of considerable beauty, now surmounted
by thriving plantations, forming a contrast to the sterile sand-hills
in their neigbbourhood. These sand-hills occupy about 1200
acres of the south-eastern part of the parish, commencing at Ste-
venston burn-foot, stretching along the shore to Irvine Bar, and
extending probably more than a mile inland. From Saltcoats to
Muirside, on the way to Kilwinning, there is a flat tract betwixt
the highway and the sea, part of which is rich loamy ground,
