during the late residence of the family in this parish, the in-
digent have so liberally received.

   Preston.-This village takes its name from the estate of
Preston, upon which it stands.  It formerly belonged to the
regent Morton, and is now the property of Mr OSWALD.
It is said to have been a burgh of regality, and had the privi-
lege of 4 fairs in the year.  A cross, of about 7 feet in height,
raised on a base of stone wall, about 4 feet square, is still
standing.  Nothing now remains of its ancient privileges,
but at this cross poinds have lately been comprised.  Some
years ago, this village was inhabited by 24 farmers; at pre-
sent there are only 3, with their cottagers.

   Salterness.-This village stands close upon the shore, due
south of the church.  It was built by the late RICHARD OS-
WALD, Esq; of Auchencruive, with the view, it is said, of a
coal trade.  A trial for coal was made in its neighbourhood,
but without successs.  It is now chiefly inhabited by persons
who keep furnished rooms, to accomodate such as, during
the season, come to it for the benefit of sea bathing.

   Sea Coast, Tower, Lime-stone, etc.-The points of land,
are Salterness and Borron.  Salterness, from whence the a-
bove mentioned village takes its name, has been considered
by some seamen, notwithstanding the charts now published
of the South-East, to be the southmost point of land in Scot-
land.  The name now appears to be corrupted.  It is said
to have been originally, Southwickness, i. e. the southermost
point, probably from a parish in its neighbourhood, called
Southwick.  Upon this ness, or point of land, a tower is erec-
ted for a land-mark for vessels on their way along this coast.
A part of it was built many years ago, by some merchants
