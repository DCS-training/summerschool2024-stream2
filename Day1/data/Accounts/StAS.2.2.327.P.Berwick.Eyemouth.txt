them; and that their wealth, if less than in former times, has at
least been acquired in a more regular and creditable manners

   From the preceding statement, it will be seen that the popu-
lation of this parish, for a number of years past, has been steadily
on the increase. If any specific cause be required for the small
amount of that increase within the last twelve or fifteen years, the
only one which can be assigned is, that within that period, a large
portion of the lands in the neighbourhood of the town, which was
formerly let as one farm, has been divided into ten or twelve small
possessions, and that the number of individuals, partly employed in
agriculture, has, by that means, been increased to a trifling extent.
   The number of illegitimate births in the parish during the last
three years was two.
