                 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   The progress of cultivation has entirely changed the appearance
of the parish, since the date of the last Account. At that time, it
would seem every one sought to grind his own meal. There were
17 mills within the parish: now, there is but one corn and flour-
mill, one saw and two flax-mills. The feudal oppression which
bound the vassal to the superior's mill is now not heard of. The
access to markets and superior mills is much increased; and no
district has improved more rapidly under the superior means of
communication which the age affords.
