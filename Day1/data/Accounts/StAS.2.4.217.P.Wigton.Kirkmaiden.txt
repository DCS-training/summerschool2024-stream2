nual amount of contributions for their relief is about L.90. Of
this sum, L.31, 12s. consists of church collections; L.30 of in-
terests from legacies; and L.30 of voluntary contributions by he-
ritors and others, mortcloth dues, &c. Parochial relief is not, in
general, considered degrading; and there is, consequently, little
reluctance in seeking it.
	Alehouses.--There are no fewer than ten ale-houses or public-
houses in the parish; and their influence on the morals and comfort
of the people is most pernicious.
	Fuel--The fuel used in the parish consists of coal imported
from England, Glasgov, and Ayrshire, and sold at the rate of 16s.
to 18s. per 24 cwt. Peat also is used; and poor people are frequent-
ly obliged to have recourse to furze and heath.
			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	The most striking variations betwixt the present state of the pa-
rish, and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac-
count, are observable in the introduction of the modern system of
husbandry; the more extensive cultivation of green crops, espe-
cially potatoes; the substitution of wheat for bear; and the now
improved state of the roads.
