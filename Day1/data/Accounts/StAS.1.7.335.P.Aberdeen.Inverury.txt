repairing to Aberdeen, where they readily find employment
in the extensive manufactures lately established there, and get
high wages.  The consequence is, that servants wages in the
country are at least double of what they were a few years
ago, and it is very difficult to get them at any rate.-There
is an ancient Druidical temple in the parish, but nothing very
remarkable about it.  At the south end of the town of In-
verury, and near the confluence of the rivers, there stands a
curious artificial mount of sand, covered with a fine green
sward.  It is called the Bafs.  It is a truncated cone, very
regular, and 40 feet of perpendicular height.  Adjoining to it,
on the east side, is another about 20 feet high, but not so re-
gularly shapen.  The vulgar tradition, about this mount, is a
very senseless one.  Probably it was a moot-hill, or place
where courts were held for administering justice.  A noted
antiquarian, some years ago, when on the spot, pronounced it
to have been such, and pointed out the places where the
judges and the parties stood.

   Church, School, and Poor.-The church of lnverury was
built in the year 1774, and the manse in 1762.  The sti-
pend is 37 l. 10 s. Sterling, and 64 bolls of meal and bear,
with a glebe of 4 acres.  The Earl of Kintore is patron of
the parish.
   The schoolmaster's salary is 100 l. Scotch, and the number
of scholars about 40 in winter, and 30 in summer.
   There are no parochial funds for maintenance of the poor.
About 14 l. Sterling, collected in the church annually, are
distributed by the church-session among 12 or 14 poor peo-
ple.
