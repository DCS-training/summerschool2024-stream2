     NUMBER III.

     PARISH OF CAERLAVEROCK.

     (PRESBYTERY, COUNTY, AND SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.)

     By the Rev. MR. WILLIAM M'MORINE.

     Name, Situation, etc.

   According to Baxter*, Caerlaverock signifies the cas-
tle close upon the sea.  The parish is a kind of penin-
sula, formed by the Solway Firth, the river Nith, and Lochar-
water; resembling a cornucopia, (a just emblem of its fertili-
ty); having its mouth towards Dumfries, into which it pours
a considerable part of its produce; and the convex side towards
Nith and Solway.  The middle and upper end of the parish
is high, with gently rising hills, and compact; it bends,
and is lengthened to a point, eastward, and this part is low
and level.  The higher ground is generally a light, dry, and
tolerably fertile loam; interspersed, however, with many a-
cres of wet, shallow, stony, moorish soil, (producing nothing
but heath and rushes), lying for the most part in the vallies;

*Glossary of British antiquities, under the word Uxela.  Mr Grose thinks
Caerlaverock signifies the castle of Lewarch Og, who was the son of Lewarch
Hen, a celebrated British poet, and founder of the castle.
