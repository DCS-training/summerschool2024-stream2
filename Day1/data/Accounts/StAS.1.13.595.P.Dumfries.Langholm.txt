of the Duke of Buccleugh, and 4 who hold of the other
proprietors.  As the farms are estimated according to their
holdings, as they are called, i.e. from the number of the sheep
and black cattle they can pasture, it is impossible to ave-
rage their value by the acre.  The land under tillage at
present, may be upwards of 1000 acres.  The arable land
around the town lets at from 10 s. to L. 1 the acre.  Some
well cultivated fields bring from L. 1 to L. 3 the acre.  It
may be observed, However, that though the farmers still
grow as much, and often more corn than maintains their
families, yet tillage is much decreased of late years, and
confined mostly to the vallies.  It is in a great measure
discontinued on the skirts of the hills, except in the imme-
diate vicinity of the town, the tenants finding it more for
their interest, from the high prices of sheep and wool of
late, to pasture than to plough them.  Houses in the town
are rented at from 15 s. to L. 10 and L. 12 a-year.  In
New Langholm, (as it is called, a neat village, built upon
a regular plan, consisting of about 100 houses, and most plea-
santly situated between the confluence of the Elk and the
Wauchope), the inhabitants, who are mostly trades-peo-
ple, besides paying a small quit rent for their house and
garden, if their house consist of one storey, have 2 acres; and
if 2 storeys, 4 acres, at from 3 s. to 14 s. the acre, accord-
ing to the quality and situation of the land, of which they
have a lease from his Grace of 14 years.  They have also
a cow grazed at 18 s. a-year, in a common pasture, which
when this village was begun, in the year 1778, was taken
off the adjoining farms, and appropriated to this pur-
pose*.
