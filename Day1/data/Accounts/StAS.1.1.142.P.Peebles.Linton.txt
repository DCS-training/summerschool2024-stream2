   The depopulation seems to be owing to sheep farms being
rented to people who live at a distance; the houses of these
farms being inhabited only by the herds instead of the far-
mer's family.  Another circumstance must be attended to,
viz. that, in 1777, Sir William Montgomery was making
large improvements on his estate; but at present there are
fewer labourers in the neighbourhood; and it is observable,
that the greatest number of empty houses are near Sir Wil-
liam Montgomery's estate.  Lord Hyndford also carried on
many improvements, but at his death these improvements
ceased.
