may contain from 600 to 900 sitters. The Burgbers in the parish
amount to nearly 100. They give a bond to their pastor for L. 80
per. annum, out of which sum be must provide himself with a
dwelling-house. With the exception of these 136 Cameronians
and Burghers, and 12 Roman Catholics, the remainder attend the
parish church. The number of communicants at the last celebra-
tion of the Lord's supper amounted to 750.
	Stipend.--In the year 1738, the stipend was fixed at 1200 Scots
with 100 merks for communion elements. Since that period, three
augmentations have been granted ;--the first in 1792, afterwards
modified to a certain extent in 1796, when the stipend was aug-
mented to four chalders of victual, half meal and half bear, and
L. 83, 6s. 11d. of money, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele-
ments. A second augmentation was granted in 1807, when the
stipend was augmented to ten chalders of victual, half meal half
barley, payable in money according to the highest fiar prices of
the county, with L. 50 Sterling of money, and L. 8 6s. 8d. for
communion elements. Last of all, the stipend was augmented in
1823, when it was modified to eighteen chalders of victual, half
meal half barley, payable in money according to the highest fiar
prices of the county, with L. 10 Sterling for communion elements.
There has been no final locality applicable to any of these aug-
mentations, the payment of each of them having been all along re-
gulated by interim decrees. A locality has now been made up,
which embraces the whole of these augmentations.
	Education.--There are two endowed schools,--one in the burgh,
which has the maximum salary and the interest of L. 200 Sterling
at 5 per cent; " mortified by the late James Richardson, Esq.
merchant, Reading, in the year 1726, under an obligation to teach
ten poor scholars, within the parish, nominated by the kirk-session,
English, latin, writing, and arithmethc." Mr Richardson also mor-
tified another L. 100 for supporting a library, and keeping in re-
pair a house of two storeys built by him for the accommodation of
the schoolmaster. He likewise mortified another L. 100, and gave
L. 20 to build a school at Hightae, and the interest of the L. 100
in favour of the schoolmaster for the time being, who was to teach
gratis the poor children of the Fourtowns. Mr Richardson was a
native of Hightae.
	At an average, 50 scholars attend the public school in the
burgh. The present master, an efficient teacher, has eleven pupils
learning Greek and Latin at 5s. per quarter.
