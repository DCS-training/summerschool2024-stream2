interest of the Prince; but the true amount of his troops has
not been exactly ascertained.
   Hawley found means to vindicate himself to his Sove-
reign; but the impressions of his conduct which remain
here, are by no means favourable to his character, as a Ge-
neral entrusted with an important command.  If we credit
report, he was dining that day at Callander house with
Lady Kilmarnock, whose Lord had then declared himself
in favour of the young adventurer, and was at that time
actually engaged in his services somewhere in the island.
   The action began about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and
by the evening the Prince's army were in possession of the
town of Falkirk.  One of the sons of Macdonell of Glen-
gary, when walking in the principal street, soon after he
had arrived from the field of battle, was shot from a win-
dow by a musket-bullet.  He did not instantly die; but
having languished a few days, he expired.  His death was
accidental, for it was occasioned by one of his own men,
whose gun had missed fire during the engagement, and not
being apprised of this circumstance, while he was cleaning
his piece, the shot went off at the expence of a life, which
he would have done much to save.  But such was the vio-
lence, zeal and distrust which prevailed, that he was found
guilty, and shot in this neighhourhood.  Soon after the
battle of Falkirk, the Prince's troops were vanquished and
dispersed at Culloden.  Thus tranquillity was restored to
the nation; and we trust, that the horrors of civil war will
never again prevail in the land.
