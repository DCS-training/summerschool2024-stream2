tion has not increased since that period, owing to the de-
molition of several villages occupied by many little pendi-
clers, who had their lands run-rig, which are now let to 
fewer tenants in larger farms, and which has sended much,
if not so the increase of the population, certainly to the
improvement of the country.  There are in the parish
about 200 weavers, 12 carpenters, 3 smiths, 20 masons, 12
tailors, 6 shoemakers, a good many employed about the 3
corn and lint mills, and the remainder occupied in the 
purpose of agriculture.  The average number for 4 years
preceding this date, of baptisms is 26, and of marriages 
for the same period is 10.  No register of deaths is kept.

   Heritors, Rent, etc.-There are 9 heritors, of whom only
3 are resident in the parish.  The valued rent is L. 3268, 17 s.
Scotch.  The real rent about 30 years ago was L. 10514,
14 s. 4 d. Scots, but is now at least tripled, by the great 
improvements made upon his estate by Mr Macdonald of 
St Martin's the principal heritor, who is employed in build-
ing a handsome mansion-house for his family.  The rents
are paid very punctually.  The people are in a thriving con-
dition, and in general very well lodge.

   Character of the People.-They are generally decent, in-
dustrious, and humane, regular in their attendance on ordi-
nances of religion, and much more showy in their dress,
and expensive in their living, than they were 12 years ago.
There are few or no differences of any denomination among 
them, and these only of the more ignorant and interior 
classes.  Upon the whole, they seem well contented with
their different situations, and enjoy in a reasonable degree
the comforts and advantages of society.
