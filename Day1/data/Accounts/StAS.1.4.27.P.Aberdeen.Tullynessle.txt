     NUMBER III.

     PARISH OF TULLYNESSLE.

     (COUNTY OF ABERDEEN.)

     By the Rev. Mr ANDREW MARSHALL.

     Name, Situation, etc.

   TULLYNESSLE, the ancient and modern name of
the parish, is evidently derived from the Gaelic, in
which language Tully signifies "a dwelling," essle "upon
"a sloping bank," corresponding to the local situation of
this place: Perhaps, however, it may have originally been
called Tullys'esset, that is, "a dwelling on the burn of 
"Esset," a small stream in the parish.  Tullynessle lies in
the county and Synod of Aberdeen, and Presbytery of
Alford; is about 4 miles in length, and 2 1/2 in breadth; being
bounded by the parishes of Keig, Alford, Forbes, Clatt,
and Leslie.  The appearance of the country is hilly, or
rather mountainous; at least it is bounded by a pretty ex-
tensive chain of mountains.  The foil in general is a loam,
very capable of improvement, and the arable land is com-
posed of gentle slopes upon the declivity of hills, with some
interjected flats.  The hills are in many places stony, but
none of them rocky; their soil is, for the most part, dry
and barren, covered with heath.  The air is pure and
healthy, consequently few epidemical distempers appear.
