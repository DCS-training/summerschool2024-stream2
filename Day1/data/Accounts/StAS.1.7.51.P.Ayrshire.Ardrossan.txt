sturdy beggars may pilfer and oppres almost with impurity:
in no place are they more clamorous and impertinent.
Last winter, a murder was committed on the body of a poor
young woman, who resided in town.  The horrid deed was
perpetrated in the fields, at no great distance.  After the
discovery, the supposed murderer with the greatest compo-
sure returned to town, where he lodged all night, and ef-
fected his escape next day, before the justices could possibly
begin a precognition; and every attempt since that time to
apprehend him has proved fruitless.

   Were the town of Saltcoats and environs erected into a
corporation, as Port-Glasgow lately was, besides the suppres-
sion of small crimes, it would no longer give shelter to great
ones.  Men of wealth, virtue, and ability would be happy to
exert themselves for the common good; the inhabitants in
general would be taught to respect, and find themselves
happy, under lawful authority; and in proportion as the
town increases in riches and population, it would also increase
in virtue and respectability.
