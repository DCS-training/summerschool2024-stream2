proposed to be considerably extended.  Their present state is
as follows:

<TABLE>

The number of weavers employed is 42, who earn, at an average,
   8 s. 6 d. per week, amounting in the year to                    L. 928   4   0
Six slaxdressers, at 10 s. per week, amounting to                     156   0   0
Twelve labourers, 5 s. per week,                                      156   0   0
                                                                    ---------------
           Total wages paid to manufacturers in the year,         L. 1240   4   0

   And, since the commencement of the present year (1793),
another manufacture of sail-cloth has been established, con-
taining 12 looms, requiring a capital of 300 L. each.  But to
shew to wheat extent the manufactures might be carried here,
it is to be observed, that there are wages given to spinners in
this neighbourhood, by persons in Stonehaven, who give out
flax for manufacturers here and in other places, to the annual
amount of 2652 L. 9 s. 6 d.  Of this sum, a large proportion is
on account of manufactures in Aberdeen, Montrose, and Ar-
broath, which have the burden of carriage of the flax and re-
turn of the yarn, to and from these towns, at the respective
distances of 15, 22, and 36 miles.  To Montrose alone, there
are sent, weekly, at an average, 30 cwt. of yarn throughout
the year.

   Manner of Living.-The style of living here is much above
what might be supposed in so small a town, possessed of so
little trade.  But it is much to be regretted, that among the
tradesmen, and lower sort of people, the practice of drinking
spirits is much too prevalent, to the ruin of their morals,
health, and circumstances.  The native beverage of our coun-
try, ale, is despised, though it is sitted to support the labourer
for his work, and encourages agriculture and manufactures;
while spirits, which enervate body and mind, also consume
the profit of labour.
