     Statistical Account

(upwards of 100 miles) one good or safe harbour, the pro-
priety of this undertaking appears in a strong point of view,
Most of our present harbours are at the mouths of rivers,
which are constantly forming bars and shallows.  At Burgh-
head, there is no river; there is shelter from dangerous winds,
a fine bottom, and water of any necessary depth.  Burgh-head is
nearly at an equal distance from Elgin and Forres; and if
it had a good harbour, would soon become the port of both
towns.  Commerce and manufactures would of consequence
soon visit this part of the country, and all the various advan-
tages, arising from them to the public, would quickly follow
such an important undertaking.

   Church, Sectaries, School, and Poor.-The stipend is 8 chal-
ders of barley, and 22 L. Sterling.  Sir Archibald Dunbar is
patron.  Till commerce and manufactures arrive, to put money
into the purses of the lower ranks, we cannot expect to see
that multiplicity of religious opinions, and diversity of wor-
ship, which mercantile wealth, in a special manner, produces.
We have two or three Antiburghers.  A small Non-jurant
meeting has existed in the parish, ever since Presbytery was
established.  It has been upheld, for many years past, by a
very small number of very poor peasants.  Will it be believ-
ed, 200 years hence, that such a description of people had,
during the whole of their lives, been at the expence of a pas-
tor and place of worship, chiefly that they might clandestinely
offer up their prayers for a prescribed race of Kings, whom
they never saw.  These people are remarkable for their good
neighbourhood, and Christian fellowship with those of the
establishment around them.-The parochial school here has
no other salary, than 7 bolls of bear, called Reader's Bear.
The number of scholars may be from 40 to 50.  Of all go-
vernments, ours requires most, that youth be well educated,
