# CDCS Summer School 2024 // Text & Data Analysis in the Wild

Welcome to the CDCS Summer School Stream 2 Repository. Here you will be able to access all the material, data, and instructions connected to the school. 

Material, data and instructions will be published within this repository by Monday June 10th before the start of the course.

This course is designed to help researchers with coding experience understand how data and text analysis projects are performed in a research environment. 
It starts with identifying a series of research questions connected to this yearâ€™s core topic (Living in Scotland Past and Present). Then it explores how computational methods can be used to obtain, clean, and analyse structured and unstructured datasets in R to answer those questions. 

Topics will include **web scraping**, **text analysis**, **sentiment analysis**, **data wrangling**, **statistics**, and **data visualisation**.

## Key principles: 
- General knowledge of the interface of RStudio and coding is required. 
- Fosters interdisciplinary thinking by bringing social science and humanities researchers together to explore methods.
- Covers both structured and unstructured data.
- Illustrates the development process of data-led projects by moving through phases of the project lifecycle.
- Challenge-led, helping researchers learn how to deal with real-world data.

## RStudio Refresher
Although the Text and Data Analysis in the Wild stream will provide attendees with many new digital skills, a level of prior knowledge is necessary to get the most out of our training. Try our short quiz to test your knowledge of R, covering some of the basics you should be familiar with before the Summer School.

If you didn't do as well as you'd hoped, don't worry! [In this video](https://edin.ac/3JzOM0P), Training Manager Dr. Lucia Michelin goes through a refresher of some of the core R tools and techniques.

## Content of the Repository
Each day of the Summer School has its own folder. Within each day, you will find the slides for the day and a folder for each block containing a data file/folder and the code that will be used during the class.

## Summer School Format
o The Summer School is meant to be interactive, and you will be prompted to replicate what the instructor is demonstrating on your own machine.

o Besides the instructors, there will be helpers present in the call who are there to help you if you get stuck or if you run into an error. Please use your sticky notes to raise problems or issues and someone will help you with addressing it. During the introduction at the start of the Summer School we will cover how to ask for help in more detail.

o We promote an inclusive and welcoming environment, so we ask you to be respectful towards our instructors, helpers and fellow participants. Disruptive behaviour will not be tolerated, and you will be asked to leave if it occurs. More information can be found in the Summer School Code of Conduct Document. 

## Summer School Data 

Will be updated by June 10th.
